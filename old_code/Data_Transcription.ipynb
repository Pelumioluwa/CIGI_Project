      "Transcribed: 00:00:16: And we still have some speakers pending from this morning's debate. And the next speaker will be the distinguished representative of the United States. You have the floor, Sir.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:00:35: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the opportunity to speak first after lunch and I appreciate my Russian colleagues agreeing with everything I am about to say.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:00:50: Mr. Chairman, sorry, if you prefer, you can delay your your intervention. No, no, no, I'm ready now. Go ahead.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:01:01: Marks, Mr. Chairman, as some delegations here have noted the task before the open-ended working group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:01:10: Is to make recommendations on possible norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior relating to threats by states to space systems, including, as appropriate, how they would contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments, including on the prevention of arms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:01:31: As a number of colleagues have mentioned, including our Brazilian colleagues, our Indian colleagues and our South African colleagues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:01:39: There is no contradiction between developing politically binding norms and seeking legally binding treaties on these issues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:01:47: It may be that we cannot have one comprehensive, legally binding treaty. Instead, we may need to consider developing political commitments quickly to address urgent issues, while continuing our efforts to seek consensus on legally binding treaties, which will require extensive notifications.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:06: We do not believe that this approach should be in any way seen as fragmenting the United Nations system or be considered discussing these issues in a piece meal fashion.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:16: As our discussions this week have shown, states are proposing responses to the broad spectrum.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:22: Spectrum of current space threats from jamming.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:29: To destructive threats.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:32: And the placement of weapons in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:35: And clearly we have heard lengthy presentations on that subject.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:41: Our Chinese colleagues have also laid out the US position on that issue quite well.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:02:47: The United States believes that Resolution 7741 is an example of precisely how we can make progress in this area rather than sitting on our hands. We identified a risk that threatened all countries use of outer space, and that is a primary factor in driving an arms race in outer space, and we developed a critical mass to address it.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:03:12: This was an important first step that the international community took to rein in the destructive testing of direct descent anti satellite missiles, which have contributed to instability in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:03:26: Raised the potential for conflict and threatened to limit the extraordinary economic potential of human action in space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:03:34: The resolution also demonstrated that progress can be achieved in addressing space security issues, including the prevention of an arms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:03:44: The United States hopes that the OEWG Final Report will welcome this resolution.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:03:50: Moreover, as history has shown, developing a norm of responsible behavior first as a non binding commitment can eventually lead or is a stepping stone to its inclusion in a future legally binding agreement.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:04:08: For example, in 1963 the UN General Assembly approved Resolution 1884, which solemnly called upon all states to refrain from placing an orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:04:24: In 1967, similar language was enshrined in the legally binding Outer Space Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:04:32: Mr. Chairman, the United States seeks to ensure that outer space remains free from conflict and has long advocated for an approach that seeks to comprehensively address all threats to space systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:04:43: Not just the placement of weapons in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:04:47: Preventing an arms race in outer space and preventing outer space from becoming an area of conflict is crucial to safeguarding the long term use of the space environment for peaceful purposes.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:04:59: We have made that clear in the previous sessions of this OEWG, in the Conference on Disarmament and in discussions at Copious.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:05:09: We believe this focus on norms, rules and principles is the most promising approach and we must be deliberate and thoughtful in our application in order to establish meaningful measures which enable risk reduction and avoid conflict without hindering the peaceful use of space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:05:29: We believe this approach allows.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:05:32: Us to achieve near term progress and spur collective effort to preserve the outer space environment. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:05:41: I thank the distinguished representative of the United States for his statement, and now I would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:05:56: Mr. Chair, thank you very much for giving me the floor.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:06:00: Mr. Chair, we have spent a lot of time this week debating the pros and cons of the non of the politically binding and legally binding approaches.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:06:10: This is an important discussion and is helping us to breakdown the artificial dichotomy between these mutually reinforcing approaches.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:06:20: We agree with the observation of the Russian delegation that there are different interpretations of the meaning of norms, rules and principles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:06:29: However, we do not agree that norms are necessarily legally binding or that they need to be codified in a legal instrument to bring benefits to space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:06:40: Indeed, we have heard much this week about the challenges of applying traditional arms control approaches to the challenges of modern space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:06:51: It is clear to us that the majority of delegations see real value in developing voluntary norms, both for the benefits they offer to space security in and of themselves.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:07:03: And as potential building blocks for legally binding instruments where these are equitable and verifiable.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:07:11: What is perhaps more important is that this OEWG is shedding a lot more light on the advantages of focusing on behaviours, the activities, actions and omissions of states, and how these can give rise to concerns and potential threats to space systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:07:31: We do not all have the same perspective on what is threatening or what is responsible or irresponsible.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:07:39: That subjective element is not an argument against focusing on behaviours. It is the very reason that we need it.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:07:48: Our discussions this week and the proposals put forward by many states have shown that this approach is already helping us to make progress.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:07:58: By discussing behaviours, we are building a shared understanding of what states find concerning or threatening.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:08:05: We are establishing a common basis for addressing these concerns and providing a stronger basis for reducing the risks that might arise from misunderstandings and lack of trust.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:08:17: Mr. Chair, more than 160 countries supported the resolution establishing this open-ended working group. We believe this high level of support reflected the desire of most countries to explore the merits of the behavioural approach through open and inclusive discussions informed by the diverse perspectives that exist among us.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:08:37: The UK believes there is an opportunity in front of us to make real progress towards reducing space threats and on preventing an arms race in outer space through the behavioural approach.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:08:49: We strongly believe it is in the interest of all states to seize this opportunity.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:08:54: The rich discussions this week and the impressive range of concrete ideas that states have submitted for new norms, rules and procedures give us cause for optimism.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:09:06: As we have heard so persuasively from many states, politically and legally binding approaches are mutually reinforcing.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:09:14: From that perspective, as we said earlier this week, we agree that in principle.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:09:20: Certain outcomes of this OWG could inform later discussions within the UN on legally binding instruments, for example in the forthcoming GGE.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:09:31: The richness of the discussions in this OEWG tells us that it will be important to maintain an inclusive approach in future UN discussions on space threats.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:09:40: By doing so, we can consider the full range of interests and concerns that states have regarding threats to space systems and the range of tools available to us to address them.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:09:51: Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:09:54: I thank the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom for his statement, and I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Iran.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:10:07: So much, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the floor. Well, actually, I have listened very carefully to the two previous interventions so far. First and foremost, we do not see that this dichotomy is artificial so far as we have given our reasoning on this case. So to what extent the negotiating of a legal binding instrument could contribute to prevention of an arm race in outer space And discussing the threats, our approach is quite different from those.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:10:39: Distinguished colleagues have already spoken before me in our understanding legal binding document based on sovereign equality of all the states as the fundamental principle of international law, can complete a space rights and obligations of all states to fill the gaps and help reduce the risk and threats of an armed race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:11:07: In our opinion, the discussion of responsible behavior, as we have already said or as colleague has said, behavioral approach is inherently.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:11:20: Divisive political agenda and ultimately, in the absence of a legal binding instrument for Paris, will end up in a situation where group of governments find themselves competent to apply an arbitrary method to judge the behaviour of others.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:11:38: In this field, and leading to a double standard and arbitrary judgment, and finally to a mere political declaration in the hands of some, to discriminately apply prohibitions and restrictions against the peaceful activities of, in particular, emerging space failings from developing country who are quite new in this area.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:05: This leads to an unbalanced political attitude.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:10: With multifaceted norms of responsibility or irresponsibility, therefore, all countries should participate in the negotiation of a legal, binding document to prevent an armed race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:25: And since I have the floor actually.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:29: Regarding the sovereign rights or sovereignty of state parties, as has to do with the threat in space or threat coming from the space, I will make my intervention later on on topic 11.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:45: But so far as the negotiation of legal binding document is concerned, we have to reiterate and repeat that this conference on its arm and long been awaited to negotiate such a legal binding document.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:02: Mr. Chairman, I'll step over here, but since I have a floor, I subscribe fully to what my colleague from China already said, that what are the reasoning that we are discussing that such a legal binding document is needed in particular?\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:19: The emergence emerging threats that are coming from the space activities of, in particular, commercial.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:28: Companies as well as some other countries. Therefore, in our view, as I may conclude in in our understanding, illegal binding document negotiation is absolutely necessary and that is the best way to reducing the threat from the space and all its application implications. Thank you so much.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:50: I thank the distinguished representative of Iran for his statement, and now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Brazil.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:05: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:08: As already explained in our interventions throughout this in previous sessions of the OWG, Razoo believes that this group's recommendations should aspire to form a normative basis to be used for future negotiations of a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:28: In this regard, it would be worth if this OEG would consider the possibility of utilizing as a reference the experience of the 2015 DGE Report on cybersecurity.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:44: A/70/174 which contained a list of non binding norms, rules and principles applied to that area.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:54: These norms have been endorsed unanimously subsequently by the UN General Assembly and have served ever since as guidelines for states behavior in the cyber domain. And they also have been progressively built upon and further detailed in a subsequent iteration of the cyber GGE and by two sessions of the cyber open-ended working group, the latest of which is still ongoing.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:15:20: My delegation fully recognizes the differences between the subject matters of cyber security and outer space. However, we believe that the format of the norms on cyber would be optimal for our work at this forum, both for the purposes of providing much needed immediate guidance for states behaviors with regard to outer space security, while at the same time laying the foundations for the future negotiation of a legally binding instrument on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:15:54: The adoption of this model could facilitate the consolidation of the proposals and the work of drafting the final report.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:16:02: Such a results in the OE WG would also provide the future GGE on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:16:08: Established by resolution A slash res slash 75250 with the stepping stone for its difficult task of recommending substantial elements of a legally binding instrument on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:16:22: Believes that bridging the results of the UAW G into the work of the future GE is important not only in terms of the substance of the work of both 4, but also in terms of generating mutual confidence in a political environment conducive to consensus. We are therefore encouraged by the statements of many other delegations regarding the need to ensure that the work of this OWG and the future GG on Paris will be compatible and mutually reinforcing.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:16:54: Our views on the matter are informed by the experience of Brazil, as the country whose expert chaired the last GGE on Paris, which, despite the best efforts of its members and its and its share, was unable to achieve consensus on its very substantive and balanced draft final report.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:15: That result was not caused by shortcomings of the text or of the by the lack of commitment of the experts that participated in the GG, but due to the challenging political climate surrounding their work and the lack of trust among key stakeholders.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:34: We are forced to acknowledge that this situation has not improved ever since and in fact might have significantly worsened.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:43: The passage on Paris did not operate on a political vacuum and neither will the future Gigi. We sincerely hope that the upcoming GG will start on a better environment, and Brazil believes that the successful and substantive results at this OWG is the best way to achieve that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:18:03: In order to ensure optimal effectiveness of our work, the OWG and the GG on space security and Paris should consider a possible division of labour that ensures the results will be harmonised and mutually compatible.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:18:19: Given the overlay of responsibilities between our work and those and the work done in Vienna, this division of labour should also include copulos.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:18:30: Before concluding, my delegation wishes to stress its satisfaction with the open, inclusive and participatory discussions that the format of this OWG has afforded the whole membership of the United Nations. As we approach the final phase of our work, we must consider how to ensure the continuation of these discussions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:18:51: Outer space security is an issue that concerns us all, regardless of our countries level advancement of advancement in terms of space technology. Thank you Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:19:02: I thank the distinguished representative of Brazil for his statement, and now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Austria.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:19:14: Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:19:18: Maybe maybe on picking up our discussion this morning, the interactive discussion also we wanted to assure the Russian Federation that we are deeply in love with Outer Space Treaty and This is why we want to take care of it also now and in the future.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:19:32: 1st, on the current topic, Mr. Chair, we want to refer to our statement on topic 4, which explained how we see the relation and complementarity of our work.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:19:44: And an approach based on behavior with the the negotiation of a legally binding instrument in the field of Paris. We consider norms, rules and principles as means to address the most pressing issues which endanger space sustainability at this moment and at a very near future and as a normative basis for the work towards illegally banning instrument on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:20:04: I will now come to topic 8:00 and 9:00 and we hope that we are still flexible in our timetable and I apologize to colleagues for coming back to this topic, but we have some messages that we want to convey.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:20:17: Transparency and confidence building measures to reduce misunderstandings and miscalculations towards the space activities of other states. By clarifying the intention of space operations in advance, other space actors can be reassured that they are conducted in line with the provisions of the Space Treaties and with international law.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:20:34: We recall that several of the existing treaties and other instruments have established measures that can contribute to transparency and confidence building. Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty provides the possibility to conduct consultations in cases of harmful interference.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:20:48: Article 11 promotes the sharing of information on space activities. As such, those existing mechanisms need to be implemented and strengthened. The Convention on Registration of objects Launched into Outer space is one of the core space treaties and provide states with a mechanism for the identification of space objects. However, the registration discipline should be improved and more efforts made to register space objects in a timely manner. At the same time, this instrument allows for the possibility to provide additional information beyond the general purposes of space objects.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:21:19: Which could include capabilities or they're used for essential civilian services. In our view, this existing mechanism provides for a flexible way to share essential information. It is also highly important to continue the work on harmonizing international registries. Similarly, we want to stress the importance of providing pre launch notifications in accordance with The Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation. We encourage all states to subscribe to this instrument to fully implement its provisions. We underline the importance of existing guidelines such as the United Nations Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:21:53: As well as the United Nations Guidelines on the Long Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities and encourage all states to implement them.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:22:01: Mr. Chair, communication and notification are essential in order to solve unclear and the biggest situations, avoid misunderstandings and alleviate tensions. The working paper of the Philippines and Germany, which was presented in our last meeting, identified a range of risks in this regard, such as a lack of understanding of space assets and technologies of other states, a lack of transparency and communication, as well as an insufficient understanding on how threats are perceived by other stakeholders in outer space. To mitigate these risks, states should, to the extent possible, share information on the general functioning of their space systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:22:35: And about their measures to promote Space Flight safety, we want to try and the many delegations who have recognized the value of the recommendations which are contained in the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Transparency and Confidence Building Measures in Outer Space Activities of 2013. In their statements and working papers, we consider the sharing of space situational awareness, information and channels for swift and direct communication as the most valuable recommendations within the context of our mandate and see merit and reaffirming them in our report.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:23:05: If ever support an increased collaboration between UNODA and Yunosa and other relevant UN entities such as the ITU. Finally, we look favorably towards the creation of a permanent consultation mechanism on space security in order to clarify anti conflict dangerous situations related to space operations. Such a mechanism should take into account the new realities of space faring, include stakeholders from different areas and use new technologies, technological means to the extent possible. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:23:36: I thank the distinguished representative of Austria for his statement, and now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Indonesia.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:23:48: Thank you, Mr. Chair, My delegation would like to express our once again our appreciation to the work and approach taken by the working group in elaborating norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior, in particular to promote transparency, capacity building and international cooperation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:24:06: My location have followed and take a note with interest proposal and working papers from delegation which many of them are considered useful as a reference for developing these norms, laws and principle against dangerous activities in space that are deemed irresponsible. However, however, Mr. Chair, my delegation would like also to reiterate that preventing all risk of liberalization and unrest in outer space, including through norms through the principle of responsible behaviour, would that be effective for legally binding instrument which is compulsory and has consensus based commitment to prevent an arm race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:24:43: Therefore, Indonesia believes that creating illegally ban instrument is still the most reliable method for the prevention of the embrace in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:24:52: But also we also understand that the parliament challenge to commence the negotiation process for creating surgically binding instrument in this area. In this regard, Indonesia would like to share the fuse that first the the outcome and accommodation of the this working group including its possible guidelines consisting norms, laws and principles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:25:12: Serve as interim measures that allow State to have a professional codes of conduct for their outer space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:25:21: Second, such interim measures, rather than seeing them as an exclusive efforts or measures, they should be seen as stepping stones that could complement and contribute to the formulation of legally binding instrument on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:25:39: Indonesia believes that such approaches would create could create the necessary environments to build trust and ensure mutually assured security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:25:46: In outer space related activities and in turn could open the opportunity for states to come to negotiation regarding legally bad instrument on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:25:56: Indonesia also looks forward to the commencement of the work of the GGE on Paris. We hope that the future work of this DGE will mutually complement and reinforce the ongoing process and bring us closer to the establishment of a legally banning storemen under on Paris. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:56:35: We expect you, Mr. Chairman, to faithfully reflect the concern of China on missile defense issue.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:56:42: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:56:45: I thank the distinguished representative of China for his statement and Ioffer the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:56:59: Mr. Chairman, just a couple comments on the recent remarks of our distinguished Chinese colleagues. First of all, as I mentioned, the question of Starlink is clearly an ITU or copious issue. And as we have heard many times before, during these discussions, let us make sure that we do not duplicate those issues here in Geneva. And then second, it is well known that the United States, Russia and China are all building missile defense capabilities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:31: And so I would welcome some additional transparency from our Chinese colleagues so we can understand what is concerning about US missile defenses compared to what China or Russia is building. And so I think those sorts of transparency measures might help us all come to an understanding on this issue. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:53: I thank the distinguished representative of the United States for his statement. I see no more requests for the floor from delegations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:09: Thus the distinguisher representative of China want to react. You have the floor.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:19: Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:23: China put forward the issue of missile defense system.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:29: Not without any ground.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:32: In the year 2008.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:36: The US distracted a satellite.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:40: And caused a large amount of debris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:45: What the United States used is the standard.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:50: ISM three missile.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:56: This missile.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:58: Is used for defensive purposes.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:03: This missile defense is used for missile defense purposes.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:11: What's more?\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:13: In the report of an NGO, it points out that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:21: The ISM Three of the United States.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:25: And the GBI interceptors.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:31: Represent.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:34: Potential larger scale.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:37: Large and flexible.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:40: Missile defense capability.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:46: Large scale anti satellite ASAP capability.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:52: Which will be able to hit Leo satellite in future conflicts.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:03: In view of the above, I wish to say that Chinas concern is firmly grounded.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:12: What's more, from the legal perspective?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:16: Missile defense.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:20: Used to count to attack satellites might give rise to a lot of legal issues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:27: For example.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:30: If country A used the missile defense system from country B.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:35: To attack satellites over country C.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:39: And cause long lived debris on orbit.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:44: And cause damage to the satellite of country D.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:50: The providing country that is country B. What kind of responsibility should it bear?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:59: I believe this merits our attention.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:03: Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:06: I thank the distinguished representative of China for his statement, and now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:21: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairperson.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:27: At the outset, we would like to respond to the comments of the.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:36: Delegate of the USA.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:40: The comments that were heard at the beginning of this session.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:47: We'd like to say that if the Russian delegation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:51: Will be in disagreement with anything. We will definitely make that clear.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:59: Just to be sure that the United States delegation does not have any doubts on that count, I think.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:09: That better than any of us, the US delegate will know that the Internet never forgets anything.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:20: As regards anti missile defense.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:27: We also like our Chinese partners.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:32: Would like to indicate that the concerns and questions which arise on the part of the Russian Federation with respect to anti missile.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:46: Systems and potential in the area of Paras.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:53: Fairly well justified.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:57: They are associated above all.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:01: With existent plans and actual activities conducted by the United States of America.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:13: Above all, I'm talking about the implementation of a number of different programs.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:21: On deploying.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:27: Anti missile strike systems that are to be space based.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:36: I think that no one in this room will be surprised to hear that the United States has allocated significant financial resources.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:47: For the implementation of such programs and their development.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:55: As a part of the US Space forces.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:00: We know that such work is underway to achieve those objectives.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:09: Moreover.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:12: The US doctrinal documents.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:16: Stipulate.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:18: Implementing such tasks.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:21: That is one of the doctrinal positions taken by Washington.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:28: In anti missile defense.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:32: And in in supporting space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:39: With respect to the development of anti missile systems that are to be land based, I won't go over that again. We've spoken a great deal about that independently and our colleague from China just now provided us with fairly detailed information on that issue.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:05: But we would like to under score that, unlike the United States of America.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:14: Which continue to consistently urge merely for the ban on tests of missile systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:27: Destructive ascent missiles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:32: The Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:36: Proposes specific, comprehensive measures.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:41: Which would be aimed.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:44: At eradicating.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:48: Risks, threats and dangers.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:52: All hazards associated with anti missile systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:58: I would remind you that we have proposals.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:05: The proposals that we've made.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:09: Are available for consideration by this OEWG.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:15: And we still cherish the hopes that they will enter the final document in the form of recommendations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:25: We propose not creating, testing or developing weapons in space for executing anti missile objectives.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:38: As one of the purposes for such weapon systems. Moreover, we also propose not creating, testing, developing or using space weapons for anti missile defence.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:57: These proposals are completely comprehensive in nature.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:04: And they are aimed specifically, as I already said, at resolving the cluster of problems around the development of anti missile potentials in the area of space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:21: But so far we have not yet heard from the United States of America.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:26: Signs of similar readiness to adopt the corresponding obligations or commitments? Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:36: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement, and I'll give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:48: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think our Russian colleague for clarifying my remarks. Someday in the future, perhaps we will be able to have a joint statement at one of these dialogues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:01: Turning to the issue of missile defense, I appreciate the fact that our Chinese colleague raised our 2008 operation Burnt Frost.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:13: And it isn't indicative of the transparency that we showed before that event. It was not an ASAT test. I'm happy to go into that, recognizing that we are running out of time.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:25: But they know the name of the missile that was used because weeks before the event, we briefed countries, we briefed Copious about what we were going to do. We were open and transparent about the threat the satellite faced and about the actions the United States felt that we needed to take. So I would welcome similar transparency on the Chinese colleagues part. What is the name of the missile that you used in 2007 to destroy a satellite?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:55: I don't think any of us.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:56: Have ever heard that name to the point where I could reference it back to you? And what is the status of that missile? You are very capable of understanding what the status of our SM Three is because we publish all of our procurement and production of those types of systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:15: So again, the United States is being attacked for our transparency on these issues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:22: On the points of our Russian colleagues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:26: I regret that we have not been able to have a dialogue on missile defense. The reasons for that are well known. I will not go into those at this point in time, but I would encourage you to read our 2022 missile defense review. We are not spending any money on space based missile defenses at this time. There is no language in that document on space based missile defenses.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:50: And then finally, this really brings home for me the reason why we did.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:57: The resolution 7741. I will never be able to prove to the satisfaction of Russia and China that this missile defense capability or any of our missile defense capabilities are not anti satellite missiles, but nonetheless what I am committing to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:14: What the Vice President has committed the United States to is that we are not going to use them.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:19: To test an ASAP capability to destroy a satellite in space so that we can keep and sustain outer space available for all countries to use. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:30: I thank the distinguished representative of the United States for his statement, and now I would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of Iran.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:44: We have heard that the following the issue of Starling should be in ITU and Corpus. Of course, we have lodged our complaint against illegal cover of my country by stalling in Kupus Security Council as well as ITU.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:03: We are discussing, however here, threats to space, I mean security to outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:11: In this OEWG and as said, the Starling mega constellation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:16: In the is not merely A civilian project, it is not secret that it is military project as well as it poses threats to the security of other states that it illegally covering the territory of other countries.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:37: Clear example is Star Shield project.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:40: Which now is open in the open source in the Internet that explicitly been clarified and defined as a military project.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:51: Having said that, Mr. Chairman issue of mega constellations such as stalling.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:58: Should not only be discussed in the corpus as well as it should be discussed here.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:05: So far as my Chinese colleague already said that there are articles in the open source that with 42,000 cubic satellites in the form of mega constellations, almost 80% of the Leo would be occupied by 1 metal constellation. Therefore there is no other place for the developing countries who are.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:32: Emerging space fading countries that they want to have their capacity to be used in the outer space. This has to be not only discussed here in terms of its security implication, but also in terms of issues related to couples as well as it. Thank you so much, Mr.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:57: I thank the distinguished representative of Iran for his statement, and I give the floor to the distinguished representative of China.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:10: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:13: I've listened very carefully to the statement by the US delegation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:18: First of all, with regard to 2008's tests by the US.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:25: We appreciate the transparency showcased by the US.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:32: However, if we refer to the past.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:41: We can dive in a lot of anti asset testing during the Cold War by the US.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:55: I don't know whether they also demonstrated at the same level the transparency.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:06: Obviously the transparency issue is not the most important point I wanted to I want to raise today.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:16: When I talk about a set defence system.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:21: Missile Missile defense system.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:25: It is to remind all of us that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:31: Some is that missile defense system can be used to attack satellites.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:38: Furthermore, they can lead to breaks up breakups in satellites.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:46: There this is a gap that exists in our discussion.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:54: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank the distinguished representative of China for his statement, and now I would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:10: Thank you again, Chairperson.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:13: Please allow me to welcome this constructive spirit demonstrated by the Delegation of the United States of America in terms of the possible development or compilation of a joint statement at some time in the future.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:32: I think that there have been plenty such statements and in the light of the upcoming work of the group of government experts.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:44: Created resolutions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:47: 250 Such a constructive spirit on the part of the delegation of the USA cannot fail but to be welcomed. It gives us all hope.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:00: As regards the questions of.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:04: Anti missile defence We have already noted the comments made by the Delegation of the United States of America with respect to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:17: Space based anti missile systems and the corresponding plans of Washington in this area taking into account this comment we consider.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:29: That and once again we note with hope.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:34: That given the absence of such plans.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:39: The US delegation would have no difficulty whatsoever.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:46: Assuming the corresponding commitments on not designing, developing or building or deploying such systems either now or in the future.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:00: I think that such steps.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:06: As we can all see, would be very warmly welcomed by the entire international community and they would facilitate.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:14: Shoring up not just security in space, but International Security as a whole. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:22: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. It seems that it is the last delegation that has requested the floor.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:32: This topic.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:35: OK.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:39: Distinguished Delegates.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:42: I have received a request from a number of civil society organizations to take the floor in this regard and as agreed, I will now suspend our former meeting to give the civil society organizations the floor to speak in an informal setting the meeting.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:01: Is informal right now.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:06: The first speaker I have on my list is the representative of the ISO International Organization for Standardization. You have the floor, Sir.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:22: Yes, thank you very much, Chair and distinguished representatives. It's my honor to participate in this OE WG meetings as a representative of ISO and a participant in the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems or CCSDS.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:38: These two standards development organizations are critical in the development of truly international standards that promote space safety and reduce space threats.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:49: Many countries have already emphasized the importance of information exchange.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:54: Yet too often the mechanism and format for such sharing is overlooked or not discussed.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:01: Here I discussed some of the CCSDS and ISO standards relevant to such information exchange.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:08: As shared in the handout provided near the room entrance.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:13: International standards are developed through intense collaboration between governments, commercial space industry, non governmental organizations, and industry associations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:25: That all of these organizations are involved represents well the global virtuous cycle of space governance that we all participate in.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:36: Guidelines including that 21 LTS guidelines developed and ratified by the UN are not standards.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:45: People may not realize the high degree of meticulous effort required to create standards that are achievable, verifiable, have market relevance, and are suitable for contractual incorporation. This exacting work demands highly qualified subject matter experts, and ISO and CCSDS are certainly no exception having over 100,000 subject matter experts.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:20:09: Representing 167 countries participating in the development of 23,000 international standards.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:20:18: There are two basic types of space standards, those that standardize how you share and exchange data and information, which is the primary focus of CCSDS, and standards that codify best practices and expected norms of behavior, such as ISO standards.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:20:36: CCSDS led and operated by the 11 major space agencies includes a navigation working group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:20:43: Which assembles space data standards that are highly relevant to achieving United Nations Copious LTS goals of space data sharing. CCSDS standards facilitate the sharing of orbit, attitude, re-entry, tracking, and conjunction data. We also participate in developing new important standards covering launch and fragmentation events in the next few years.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:11: Within ISO, we assemble space standards associated with design, integration, and test operations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:18: The Space Environment Program Management Materials and Orbital Debris Mitigation Standards for Space Safety, Launch and honor Collision avoidance, Space Traffic Coordination.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:34: Large constellations and space sustainability are particularly pertinent to this open-ended working group. A new ISO working group was recently added to address standards for downstream products, including standardization of commercial products such as precision navigation, navigation and timing.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:52: And finally, I'd like to point out that there is a time lag between when a standard is first published and when a space system can incorporate that standard. For example, a satellite may have a mission lifetime design lifetime of up to 15 years, and that satellite would likely have adopted standards that were published 15 years ago and therefore may now be outdated by 15 years from a standards perspective.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:22:21: Therefore, it is imperative that standards development be prioritized now for all countries in the new space era, including NGOs and the space industry, so that it is clear how space information should be shared and what best practices and norms of behavior should be utilized by the global space community. I thank you for the opportunity to speak about International Space Data Exchange and Best Practice Standards Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:22:50: I thank the representative of ISO for his presentation. And now we will listen to the presentation by the representative of the Secure World Foundation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:07: Thank you, Mr. Chair and distinguished representatives. My name is Doctor Brian Whedon and I'm the Director of Program Planning for Secure World Foundation, a private operating foundation dedicated to the secure and sustainable use of outer space for the benefit of all peoples of the Earth.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:26: I appreciate the chance to address this very important meeting and in particular the topic of how space situation awareness can impact norms, rules and principles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:37: Responsible behaviors in space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:40: My organization has been working for several years to bring together governments, satellite operators, academia, and other stakeholders to discuss ways to improve sharing of SSA information between different space actors and increase the trust and reliability of such data.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:59: We recently started focusing on how SSA capabilities might be used for monitoring behaviors in space and verifying compliance with current and future legally binding agreements on space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:24:14: We feel this is critical to the success of establishing and upholding norms, principles and rules in space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:24:23: Monitoring and verification will enable countries to ensure that others are following the norms or rules, build confidence in those frameworks and help prevent misperception mistakes that could lead to conflict.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:24:39: However, our examination so far has shown that much more work is needed to refine this concept.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:24:47: While useful in many regards, SSA capabilities are limited in terms of what kinds of threats can be detected, monitored and attributed, and there are significant challenges still in interpreting the meaning of the technical data.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:02: For example, SSA capabilities can be used to verify certain threats to space systems in orbit.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:09: Such as destructive anti satellite tests and uncoordinated close approaches, but are less helpful in verifying threats that are less visible and not as easy to attribute to a specific actor such as cyber attacks and electronic warfare.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:27: SSA can help both in identifying patterns of life for normal space activities and when space objects behaviour diverges from those normal patterns, as well as verifying that behaviors agreed to as part of legally binding arms control agreements are being followed.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:45: Other challenges also exist.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:49: The specific type and sources of SSA data necessary to verify an agreement will largely depend on the type and details of set agreement.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:59: We will also need sources of SSA data that can be validated and trusted by multiple parties, likely with differing levels of technology.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:09: These and other points are expanded on in a written submission we have provided to this body.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:15: Going forward, we encourage States and civil society to explore these issue furthers and help develop answers to these questions. Doing so will help create a monitoring and verification regime that can enhance future voluntary agreements and enable legally binding measures that help make space safer and more secure for all space actors. Mr. Chair, Thank you for your time.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:41: I thank the representative of the Secure World Foundation for his presentation, and I give the floor to the representative of Project Ploughshares. You have the floor.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:52: Opportunity to address this working group. I would like to express my appreciation for the hard work and creativity the Delegates have committed to this process, which is inspiring to those of us on the observing side. I would also like to thank the delegates who expressed support for maintaining established practice regarding the participation of NGOs at the meeting by promoting greater inclusivity and transparency to discussions. Such participation lends additional legitimacy to the outcome.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:27:21: My name is Jessica WI am a senior researcher representing Project Ploughshares, a peace Research Institute of the Canadian Council of Churches, which has consultative status at the United Nations. Our work is focused on disarmament and International Security, including specific work on outer space governance. The topic that I want to address is the contribution of norms, rules, and principles to the negotiation of legally binding instruments.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:27:48: Complementarities between these approaches is a key finding of my recent research report examining arms control lessons from other domains of military activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:27:57: Which you can find online.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:00: Titled The Security Regime for Outer Space, it argues for a broadview of arms control not as a single discrete tool or legal agreement, but instead is a cohesive collection of purposes and processes that include shared values and principles, obligations and restraints, compliance and confidence building, measures and tools, mechanisms and institutions to facilitate ongoing political engagement, dialogue, and the implementation of measures to enhance mutual security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:29: The process of developing norms of responsible behavior touches on all of these elements and is core to such a security regime.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:37: On the why of arms control, the statement by the Netherlands earlier this week noted that space security is not only about weapons, but is underpinned by shared values, specifically those found in the Outer Space Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:48: As many states here have expressed, a core aspiration and sentiment of this treaty is peace. Peace for people, peace for the planet and peace for the future.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:57: This focus on peace translates well into a humanitarian approach to arms control and disarmament.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:02: That can be both instructive and productive for outer space. As noted by the RCRC, humanitarian values are not restricted to IHL. Humanitarian interests, including protections for civilians for the environment, gender considerations and inclusivity, have driven all recent multilateral arms control agreements. Concern for space debris and the effects of military activities on civilians are examples from this week that we can build on of this focus.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:32: As our gendered perspectives to space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:36: Looking at the what of security and arms control, Legal measures for decades have struggled over the definition and verification of space weapons, particularly due to the dual purpose capabilities demonstrated throughout the discussion this week. This is not a unique challenge to outer space, but lessons from other domains demonstrate that the focus on behaviors can help. This has been tackled elsewhere through efforts to develop positive practices and behaviors related to the peaceful uses of capabilities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:30:03: As well as restraints on particularly harmful uses, activities, and effects, many such ideas for positive behaviors as well as potential restraints have been discussed this week and could contribute to future legal agreements. Now, it is important to clarify that a focus on behavior does not ignore capabilities. As the Philippines noted with regards to norms and laws, this is a false dichotomy. Behavioral rules and practices flow from a concern with capabilities, but without limiting the right to develop or access technology for peaceful purposes.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:30:34: At the same time, behaviors help to distinguish those peaceful purposes from potentially harmful applications, both aiding arms control and enhancing access to technology.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:30:44: Finally, to have an impact on security dynamics, words must be turned into action and states must have confidence and compliance with agreements, whether politically or legally binding. This concern has been raised by states here this week, including by both India and France. My research echoes proposals mentioned by others to increase the sharing and accessibility of data that can be used to monitor space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:31:06: But there is also a need to make space activities themselves more observable, and this can be achieved by adopting norms of behavior rooted in transparency and communication. Many such examples of how we can do that that are both practical and feasible have been discussed this week. Such visibility is further essential to any future legal restrictions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:31:27: We lack at the moment, practical mechanisms to support the development, implementation and monitoring of agreements, including core tools and processes to support dialogue with others, to exchange information, to consult and to communicate. Again, I echo my appreciation for the broad range of very practical contributions that have been discussed this week.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:31:49: Um, actually, I do have another Finally, Finally, lack of political will is repeatedly cited as the greatest obstacle to continued peace and arms control in space. But the extensive engagement with the current OEWG process, as well as support for another GE on Peros, demonstrates ample will. The challenge, as noted by Brazil, is how to direct these processes into complementary and coherent outcomes. And now here, if you will excuse my earthly pun, we are on familiar territory. We know from other fields of arms control that success requires persistent dialogue.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:32:22: Layers of approaches rooted in shared values and principles, in mutual obligations and restraints and the means and mechanisms to implement them. And so to echo the words of the UN Secretary General at this forum, we should dare to be bold and ambitious, not only to advance norms of responsible behavior, but also to have a positive contribution to the discussion of legally binding instruments. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:32:44: I thank the representative of Project Plowshares for her brief presentation. And now we go back to the formal setting of our meeting.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:32:56: OK, now we have to address the the the last of the of the items which is the the way ahead.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:33:06: And in this regard, I would like to say a few words on on the way ahead before I open the floor to to delegations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:33:14: Distinguished delegates, we have now concluded our initial consideration of agenda Item 6C, Reducing Space Threats through Norms, Rules, and Principles of Responsible Behaviors to make recommendations on possible norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors relating to threats by states to space systems, including, as appropriate, how they would contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments, including on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:33:46: I wish to express appreciation to those delegations that have reacted to the paper we have prepared, containing possible elements on items 6A and 6B of our agenda.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:34:00: In this regard, I would like to recall that the paper, which is under my sole authority, reflects a non exhaustive set of elements drawn from the statements and working papers of states participating in this open-ended working group. This paper is also without prejudice to the preparation and adoption of the report of the working group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:34:23: I would also like to remind all delegations that preliminary written feedback from all delegations on the possible elements.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:34:31: Will be welcomed until Monday 20th of February 2023.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:34:37: It is my intention to prepare a similar paper containing possible elements on agenda item 6C reflecting our discussions this week, as well as the working papers that have been submitted by Member states. All delegations will also have an opportunity to provide preliminary written feedback on that paper.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:34:59: On the basis of that written feedback.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:35:02: I will prepare a revised Consolidated Elements paper with six AB and C, which I hope can serve as a basis.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:35:13: For virtual informal consultations, I intend to convene during the intersectional period.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:35:20: I will provide information on the timing and modalities of these consultations in due course. It is my hope that these virtual information consultations will enable us to lay the groundwork for us.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:35:35: To begin the consideration of the report of the group in earnest at our fourth session.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:35:43: I will also remain available for consultations with any individual delegation or group during the intersectional work. This intersectional work is going to be more intense than the previous international work, as we have to reach our meeting with as much advanced work as possible.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:05: These are just a few of the few of the ideas that I wanted to share with with the allegations and I opened the floor. I already have one delegation that has requested the floor, the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:23: Mr. Chairman, thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:28: To be honest.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:30: We wanted.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:33: To note.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:34: Our interest maybe after discussing this this issue, to go back to an informal format so as to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:47: Ask questions to those NGOs who spoke in the informal format.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:55: Furthermore.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:36:58: Try to respond and to comment to some of the comments that were made.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:03: By those NGO's.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:08: As to this specific issue.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:14: Overall\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:17: we agree.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:19: What you suggested we can live with that regarding work going forward.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:25: Yes, holding consultations with.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:32: States in the intercessional period.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:35: Is important and would be very relevant even if it's virtual.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:45: In terms of maybe that's the most wisest in terms of saving time, the one pending question we have in that respect.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:37:55: Couldn't you give us an idea, a rough idea of of the framework, of the context, the time frame when you intend to submit the first, the initial version of the draft report?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:38:15: Because elements in the report.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:38:20: They are indeed.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:38:24: That that would certainly facilitate our work and your work.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:38:30: On the on the draft report, but it's important.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:38:35: That when the.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:38:39: Final version of the draft report prepared by you and your team comes out so that at that point we can begin to officially consider that document. So practice the practice in preparing outcome reports for such working groups.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:38:57: Varies from format to format, but.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:39:03: But what the draft report of our group as a standalone official document should be prepared ahead of time that's that's that that's the practice is confirmed that practice and the sooner we begin working on the draft outcome report and not just on elements, we think that would provide greater.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:39:28: Greater chance for preparing such a document to make it as comprehensive as possible.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:39:36: So that delegations genuinely had, you know, had more time, it would give them more time.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:39:43: To come to an agreement.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:39:46: To reach some sort of compromise, consensual understandings or recommendations that could feature in such a document. So the earlier you can do that, the earlier you can do that, the more we would welcome that. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:40:03: Thank you to to react immediately to the questions raised.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:40:10: I I completely agree with with the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. Usually we agree on most things and this is the case. We will try in the next couple of weeks to to produce a consolidated elements paper and after the consultations we will be able to work on and try and and produce the first draft which is not going to be called draft, it's going to be called the chair's non paper.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:40:40: But the intention is to to be able to have that first on paper.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:40:46: In in in Spring. Hopefully as early as possible, but that is the idea and I will provide more precise dates I hope soon.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:40:57: And now?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:41:00: Regard is there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there any other delegation? Yes, the distinguished representative of Iran.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:41:11: So much, Mr. Chairman, we just have a question or point for clarification. You have given us the 20th, 25th of February.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:41:20: As comment on the element preliminary element that you have prepared and you said that you are also working on the consolidated element paper, well, shall I ask kindly from you that give us a kind of speculation that how you want to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:41:41: That this final report based on consensus to be prepared of course the reference was made to the work of the cyber OEWG that I will participate. So far as this issue is concerned, it's very complicated and due to the I could say.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:42:05: Different issues that has been discussed here in terms of the topics.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:42:09: Seems likely that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:42:12: The variety of issues should be discussed in the context of that report. Therefore I want to know that if possible that how you will ultimately guide the delegations to come up to consensus so far as that consolidated becomes a chain on paper, then zero draft and ultimately would take us to a document whereas take it or leave it.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:42:39: This kind of style of negotiation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:42:42: Is has a lot of difficulty so far, then all the responsibility would be on your shoulder. So a kind of ruling text that the different delegation would have a possibility of.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:42:58: Discussing either in the formal, informal or margin to give and take, we believe that would take us to a consensual text, unfortunately such.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:43:10: A style is not taken into account, the OEWG of cyber and everything is on the sole responsibility of the chair and unfortunately for the first report.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:43:24: The delegation were taken to a stand, whereas the views of so many different delegation were not taking into account in the report. And so far that was a situation because we didn't have time and the chairperson was obliged to prepare a report. Every delegation were taken to a take it or leave it. This is not a very good style of negotiation because all of us.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:43:55: If there is a consensus, should feel ownership for the report. Therefore a kind of speculation of the way that you are going to forward would be very.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:44:07: If possible, very useful to us to know how to follow this issue. Having said that, Mr. Chairman will actually on the 1st element also as I have pointed out from the beginning.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:44:24: This issue of behavioural approach on the basis of responsibility of, or irresponsibility, unfortunately have been taken.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:44:34: Into granted and view of some other delegation has not been comprehensively taken into account. Therefore, our humble request from you is that the any kind of elements so far.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:44:50: Rather.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:44:52: This preliminary element and then comprehensive would be balanced and taken into account the views of all from my understanding of this week's discussion. As I have said it before, I feel that there there is a SEAL delegation are far apart.\n",
