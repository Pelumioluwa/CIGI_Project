    "Iran expressed concerns about dual use capabilities in space operations, citing that the behavioural approach to this issue could lead to misperceptions and unintended side effects for developing countries. They suggested that this issue is complex and requires careful examination. Iran is of the view that the dual use capability context could potentially be used as a tool for some to exert discriminatory policies. Therefore, they recommend assurance and reassurance approaches through legal norms. Iran also emphasized the importance of peaceful use of outer space, which is very needed for everyday life in countries. They warned against policies of restrictions and export control by developed countries against developing nations that could hamper their peaceful exploration and use of outer space."

      "In Session 3, Meeting 5, the United States raised concerns about the Chinese system She-Jin 21 (SJ21), which is described as being used to test and verify space debris mitigation technologies.
