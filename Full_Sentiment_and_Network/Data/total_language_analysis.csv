S1M12,1,1,Chile,"Before going to the logistics and the background of our work, I would like to express myself in Spanish for some light remarks. I would like to thank you once again for giving me your trust to direct the work of this new working group of the United Nations. This responsibility is a recognition of the constructive role that my country, Chile, has played in the framework of world efforts aiming to find collective, peaceful and creative solutions. to the controversies and challenges faced by the international community. In this context, we share this vision with other nations that promote the strengthening of multilateral mechanisms and the international legal regime, because it is the only way to guarantee the peace and defense of common interests. by means of an international order based on clear and universal rules. Therefore, despite the existing difficulties, the work of this non-limited composition work group will allow us to seek to find a place of agreement concerning the threats that weigh on space security. Without any doubt, there are several points of view on the priorities that exist on the subject, but in the framework of our work, we will be able to take into account these different points of view, so that all the existing sensitivities can be taken into account. If our vision is partial, then we will not be able to reach our goal. to know how to fill the mandate that was given to us by the General Assembly, to produce a report including recommendations of rules, rules and principles on the behavior responsible in the framework of space activities. Once again, I call on all delegations to actively and constructively participate in our work. Because only through the commitment of all delegations, we will obtain results on our objectives. Taking into account the nations that have space exploration programs, the nations that are committed to this field, as well as those that depend on space technologies. I come back to this point because the open nature of this group allows us to participate widely and I am convinced that the more we are representative of the States but also of civil society, the more this process will be legitimate. Fortunately, we were able to resolve the questions in suspension regarding our meeting schedule. This allows us to launch discussions on the background issues that have occurred in the mandate that was entrusted to us by the General Assembly. I will come back to this subject in more detail later. Over the past few weeks, I've heard several comments that take into account the possibilities of successful multilateral efforts. This is due to the current geopolitical situation. On this subject, I would like to point out that these concerns must not make us lose hope. On the contrary, they must highlight the urgent nature of our task, namely finding a common agreement on space threats. I hope that with the commitment and participation of all the guys, the guys who are present, we will be able to have constructive discussions during this first work session. Thank you. I will continue in English before passing the exam of points on the order of the day. I warmly welcome Mrs. Melanie Rijimbal. New Director of the Geneva branch of the Department of Disarmament Affairs. We wish you success in these efforts. As you know, she has been the director of the United Nations Center for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America, in Lima for years. Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen, delegates. This group was created under the resolution of the General Assembly 76-231, entitled Reduce Space Threats by Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behavior. This resolution provides us with the mandate of our work. You will remember that, according to paragraph 6 of resolution 76-231, a work group organization session was held in Geneva from February 7 to 9, 2022. During this session, we came to an agreement on various issues, and in particular, the group adopted its order of the day, currently published under the code A-AC-294-2022. The group has affirmed the applicability of the United Nations General Assembly's internal regulations to this body and has affirmed that all decisions taken by the group must be based on a consensus between the Member States. The group has affirmed... that other international organizations, commercial actors and representatives of civil society, as mentioned in paragraph 6 of resolution 76 of 131, will have the possibility to participate in the public plenary meeting of the group as observers and will be able to submit written contributions on the questions examined by the group. and this will be given to the organization for free. As part of the established practice, the President has decided to provide the group with a list of entities with a consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as part of information, as well as a list of all other organizations and commercial actors based on the principle of This list is available at the entrance of the conference room. You will remember that at the organization session, the question was raised about one of the linguistic versions of resolution 76.231 which... raised a doubt about the number of sessions that the group had to organize. As promised, I consulted the Member States and I submitted the question to the General Assembly. In this regard, I am delighted to inform you that on April 26, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly, on proposal of the permanent mission of Chile to the United Nations in New York, adopted decision 76-561. This one currently has the quota at 76, 50. As a result of this decision, the General Assembly has defined the following sessions for the working group. Unless, of course, the working group decides otherwise. First session this week from 9 to 13 May 2022. Second session from 12 to 16 September 2022. 3rd session, January 30th to February 3rd, 2023. And to finish, 4th session, July 7th to August 11th, 2023.",1
S1M13,1,1,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. President. I will now ask for the floor. on what you have proposed regarding the participation of non-governmental structures in the work of our pregnant woman. We have received two lists. One contains four organizations and the other five. The first category, namely the four organizations on the first list, are structures that have a consultative status with the ECOSOC. We fully support their participation in the work of our session, and this under the title of the established practice at the General Assembly. Regarding the second category, the second list, including five structures, we would like to remind you that During the organization session, we had long debates about the participation of these structures. The position of my country was as follows. We must respect established practice, nevertheless, so let's understand that... the participation of these structures in a system such as ours does not know of previous ones. And so... Even if we are not really satisfied with your proposal regarding the participation of this second category of independent structures, non-governmental structures, we understand that their contribution is precious for the work of our group. And according to us, this proposal that you have made gives them the right, at the end of each daily session, to express themselves, provided that the delegations do not oppose it. And if time allows us to. and on condition that their statements are not official. In these circumstances and in the precise case, we can accept your proposal. However, once again, I repeat that these three conditions must be respected. To know that there is no objection from the States. that time allows. and that their interventions do not take time, which could have been devoted to the deliberations between the delegations. And thirdly, that their statements... that these statements are not official. If we don't have enough time, these structures, which are in the second list, and therefore these five organizations, will be able to transmit their comments, their observations, their statements, or their documents as written material. We fully support your proposal. which is to create an internet resource where all these statements would be published. This would allow... to progress in the question exam that you identified for this session and that will also be raised during the next sessions.",2
S1M15,1,1,Cuba,"Cuba representative, please. Thank you, President. It is a pleasure to be here. Thank you, Mr. President. It is a pleasure to be here. As was the case in the past, you know that you can count on the full participation of my delegation. I asked for the floor, I will express myself briefly to ask for clarifications on some of the procedures to be followed and which are very important for my delegation. You submitted a proposal, I understand that the Russian Federation accepted this proposal, but as for the delegation of Cuba, we need to send... to our capital, the list of organizations for approval. I would like to thank you for the way you managed to find compromises during our organization session. We have asked for a list and you have indeed submitted this list that we have just received. We have transmitted it to our capital. I simply ask you to give us a deadline so that this list can be approved by our capital. As for the work program that you have broadcast, I understand that we could show some flexibility, but formal decisions will be taken. You also submitted a proposal that will have to be adopted at some point or another. This can be done simply, but an adoption will be necessary. I would therefore like to clarify that... It seems to us that we are still at a stage of consultation to find out if we can accept or not this participation. You know that Cuba supports the participation of civil society, especially on disarmament issues. Their participation seems positive to us, but... I ask you to give us a deadline to reach a final decision on the subject. I understand that you only made a proposal and that no decision has yet been taken. We have also taken note of the decisions taken in New York, but I would like to take this opportunity to underline the fact that it does not seem appropriate that the subjects dealt with in Geneva face the subject of decision in New York. without Geneva being informed, especially on the dates chosen for the meetings. Our delegation did not have any problems interpreting the decision taken by the General Assembly. We understood that two sessions would be organised. However, as I said, we are concerned that calendar decisions are made without consulting Geneva. has a representation in New York and our delegation brought us internal consultations. But I have trouble imagining the headquarters of Geneva decided on a meeting date in New York. There is a Cuban saying that says that a tree that is not twisted will never see its trunk re-straighten. We want to avoid this situation. We are seeking to support positive results within this working group. You know that this is our national position.",2
S1M16,1,1,Geneva,"Thank you, Mr. President. And once again, I welcome you to Geneva. I thank the representative. of Cuba. Thank you for your support and your constructive participation in our work. As for your questions, well... I have formulated a proposal regarding the participation of non-governmental and civil society representatives. I did not ask for a formal decision to be made on the subject, because it is a proposal that was born following long exchanges between delegations during the February organizational session. We also debated this bilaterally over the past few months.",2
S1M17,1,1,Cuba,"I understand that it is necessary for the Cuba delegation to have a deadline to obtain... the Green Fire of its capital, concerning the participation of these different entities. We will certainly try to take your decision into account. We hope to be able to... on your approval at the end of this session. As for the dates now... The meeting dates have not really been decided in New York. What has been decided in New York is the procedure to follow, the decision that has been taken regarding the dates.",2
S1M110,1,1,United Nation,"This is Mrs. Sylvia Balache, president of the Group of Work No. 2 of the UN Commission on the Disarmament. She will present the work of this group. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, allow me to congratulate you on the occasion of your election as the president of this working group. I wish you a lot of success in your work. Mr. President, this year, the working group 2 of the disarmament commission has taken hold of the point entitled recommendations to promote practical implementation of measures of transparency and confidence in space activities in the view of preventing a race to armament in the space of the atmosphere on the measures of transparency and confidence in space activities. The disarmament commission has not met since 2018, and therefore this year the objective is to familiarize delegations with our work on this subject and then facilitate the exchanges of views and proposals throughout the session. To do this, I decided to invite experts from various international and non-governmental organizations to make presentations. These exhibitions were well received. The delegations were able to raise questions that were mentioned by the experts, and we were able to create and set the setting for next year's session. The names, affiliations and subjects that were raised by the experts are in the summary of the presidency of this meeting that I produced personally. Now, on the background, the work group examined the measures of transparency and confidence of the 2013 report of the Governmental Experts Group. Subject by subject, we heard expert presentations and we proceeded to exchange views. We also examined sections 5 to 7 of this report in the same way. During the deliberations, delegations have made it clear that it is important to ensure that the space is used for peaceful purposes and that the existing legal regime applies to space activities. It has been suggested that the Commission of Disarmament be able to reaffirm the existing legal regime. of space activities adopted by the Committee on Pacific Uses of Space, the COPUS. The issue of the rapid launch of negotiations at the disarmament conference of a legally binding instrument on the prevention of a arms race in the space has also been raised. And in this context, this unlimited composition work group has also been mentioned. The continuation of these measures of transparency and confidence in space activities, as contained in the 2013 report of the GGE, was addressed in detail in view of using these measures to reduce the risks of misunderstanding and misappreciation. It has been recalled that these measures could represent the starting point of a legally restrictive instrument. and which would deserve more exchanges. The importance of information exchanges on national space policies and space activities has been put forward and it has been suggested to make these public policies easily accessible. Regarding information exchanges and notifications regarding space activities and notifications for reducing risks, many delegations have... to know what they had done since 2013. It was mentioned that states should also share their information about the knowledge of the space environment, and provide communications about their orbit maneuvers. and launch notifications, as well as communications about possible collisions. Regarding maintenance of satellites in service or debris collection, it was highlighted that this could be considered a threat if we do not know the intention behind these activities. In this context, the importance of total transparency and the consent of all States concerned by these activities has been highlighted. The code of conduct of the AECO against the proliferation of ballistic missiles has also been mentioned as an essential measure of confidence and transparency. The working group has also examined the topics of contact and visits on the launch sites for the working group. Concerning international cooperation, the consultation mechanisms, information and coordination. The delegations supported measures to promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of the space and the use of consultation mechanisms. It was proposed that the States create contact points to reduce the risks of escalation and conflict. In order to implement paragraph 37 of the 2013 report and in application of the General Assembly, in resolution 76-231, the working group has proceeded to exchange information and deliberations on national space policy. This part of the session has been a great success. In the end, 11 States have presented their national space policy. To conclude, the Member States have also examined the importance of political commitments. to not deploy weapons in the space first and the importance of universalizing this initiative, which could be a measure of transparency and fundamental confidence. The definition of a weapon in the space or the fact that a good number of States consider that weapons have already been deployed in the space has also been raised. Allusion was made to the initiative to adopt a national commitment to not lead anti-satellite missile tests to direct ascent. It was proposed that such a national commitment represent the starting point of a general international commitment and could be erected as a new international norm of responsible behavior in space. It was said that, certainly, the commitments of this nature represent a step in the right direction. This is, nevertheless, a declaration that may not have practical impact. On the basis of the deliberations of the working group, an activity report has been adopted. The working group has therefore taken an important step towards the realization of its mandate. Mr. President, I hope that this brief overview of these works led to New York. will benefit from the work of the non-limited composition working group while you start your own deliberations today. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Mrs. Sylvia Balache, president of the Work Group 2 of the UN's disarmament commission, for her presentation on the work of this group. It is also a valuable contribution to our delegations, our deliberations rather. This concludes our point 1 examination. I wish you all the best. You are invited to go to point 6A, to the day order, entitled, Reduce Space Threats by Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behavior. To make the inventory of existing international legal and normative frameworks concerning the threats that the States pose. in the space. As it was announced, we will start a thematic debate. The first theme, international law, concerning the threats arising from the behavior of states in the space. We will hear Mr. David Kwan-Waychen, Executive Director of the McGill Research Center. in the field of aerospace law, Mr. David Koploff from the University of Georgetown, Department of Law, and Ms. Setsuko Aoki from the University of Keio, Department of Law. As has already been mentioned, this will be an informal exchange, and experts will not be interviewed. We will then... Okay, so I will. To the board. Professor David one way channel. Do you sound like a research on the air on the Tiki special. You have the power. Thank you. Honorable Jefferson. This English delegates and observers. It is a great honor to be invited to address the open and working group and to contribute to the first substantive agenda item. I'm humbled to represent the McGill Center for Research in Air and Space Law, the Institute's research arm, which for decades has been at the forefront of research and dissemination of knowledge in space law, including on topics relating to arms control and disarmament in outer space and the peaceful and military uses of outer space. My colleague, Professor Ram Jaku, acting director of the McGill Institute, senses regards for not being able to deliver remarks in person. We hope our small contribution will norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior. Such norms, rules, and principles will go a long way to strengthening existing international law as they apply to outer space, building greater confidence and transparency, as well as maintain safety, security, sustainability of space activities for the benefit of all. From the outset, we wish to underline that even in the absence of a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space or a binding instrument on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force in outer space, there are laws and legal principles that place restraints on the use or testing of weapons and other military space activities. The following remarks build on the written statement already submitted to the working group and will be centered around the following. One international law, including the UN Charter is relevant and applicable to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. international law is relevant and applicable to all space activities, including the weaponization of outer space and military activities in outer space. Three, international law must be observed in good faith at all times. And four, existing international as it applies to outer space must be interpreted and clarified in accordance with the unique legal and physical nature of outer space. Firstly, we echo the submissions of other delegates. including the International Committee of the Red Cross, that space activities, quote, do not occur in the legal vacuum, but are constrained by existing international law, notably the UN Charter and the Outer Space Treaty, unquote. The Outer Space Treaty provides prohibitions relating to specific weapons and military activities. There is a prohibition on objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, installation of such weapons. on celestial bodies or stationing of such weapons in any other manner, and the complete prohibition on the establishment of military bases, installations and fortifications, the testing of any weapons, and the conduct of military maneuvers on celestial bodies. These two fundamental principles remain relevant to this day and underpin the regime governing the weaponization of outer space and military activities in outer space. In addition, article one of the outer space treaty provides the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, must be carried out for the benefit and interest of all countries. Furthermore, article three of the outer space treaty provides that space activities must be conducted in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding. Thus, the legality of any action of any state that has a bearing on the weaponization of outer space and any military activity in outer space must be assessed in accordance with norms specified in the outer space treaty and must be in accordance with international law in general. In recognition of the unique domain of outer space and the unique nature of space applications, all space activities. Specifically, the outer space treaty provides states must have due regard to the corresponding interests of other states when conducting space activities. States must undertake international consultation before proceeding with any space activity expected to cause potentially harmful interference with the space activities of other states. States have the right to request consultation regarding a space activity planned by another that would potentially cause harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. And finally, states must inform the UN Secretary General, as well as the public and the international scientific community to the greatest extent possible, feasible and practicable of the nature, conduct, locations and results of such activities. My dear colleague, Professor Setsuko Aoki will elaborate on the principle of view, regard surely. So I defer to expert knowledge on that. Suffice to say, the aforementioned obligations attach to freedom of exploration and use of outer space, regardless of whether such activities are military or non-military in nature, and regardless of whether such activities are performed by governmental or non-governmental entities. Concerning the weaponization of outer space, the above principles apply regardless whether a weapon is space-based, earth-based, or employs means of disruption. or destruction that is facilitated through non-collecting means or even cyber means. Similarly, the above principles apply to military activities and outer space directed at outer space and from outer space. Indeed, fundamental principles of international law, international space law, and even international humanitarian law would constrain the testing and use of any weapon or methods or means of war that exist today that are under development. that may come into being in the future. Chairperson, there are many provisions of international law that have direct applicability to the weaponization of outer space and military activities in outer space. Due to time constraints, I would allude to two important ones. In our view, the testing and use of any chemical, biological, or nuclear weapon in outer space, including on the moon and other celestial bodies, is prohibited under international law owing to specific obligations of writing as arising from treaties such as the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention. From the environmental protection perspective, we should keep in mind that the Environmental Modification Convention prohibits, quote, military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long lasting, or severe effects as the means of destruction, damage, or injury. Contrary to assertions that the Outer Space Treaty and other space law treaties are outdated, there is consensus among states even today that they are still relevant and applicable to accommodate new space activities and applications and meet emerging new challenges. Indeed, as mentioned, various other international treaties and customary international law principles would constrain space weaponization and military uses of outer space. Secondly, we note that international law Sorry, international space law, there is no distinction made between military or non military activities. As states have expressed during the drafting of the outer space treaty, it is impossible to distinguish between military and non military uses of outer space. What is important is not whether activities are military or non military, but whether activities are consistent with the UN Charter and other obligations of law. It must adhere to and be conducted in accordance with the fundamental principles of international law, including, as mentioned, the UN Charter. Thirdly, having outlined the special legal principle that's constrained testing and use of weapons in outer space and military activities in outer space, we underline that international obligations must be observed and interpreted in good faith. The good faith principle is a fundamental principle in international law and is the root of international peace and security. as the International Court of Justice pronounced in nuclear test case, trust and confidence are inherent in international cooperation, in particular in an age where this cooperation in many fields is becoming increasingly essential. Without prejudice to the body of international humanitarian law, it applies in the event of an armed conflict. Obligations flowing from the UN space treaties and from general international law apply and must be observed in good faith at all times. Having consented to the outer space treaty and other space law treaties, states cannot simply disregard obligations that qualify the weaponization of outer space and military space activities. The obligation to cooperate, have due regard and enjoy shared trusteeship of outer space necessitates good faith on all members of the international community. If states do not fulfill in good faith, binding obligations under existing international treaties, how can they be expected? to do so with regards to new norms, rules, and principles the international community aspires to develop. This brings me to my final point, and that is international law, as it applies to outer space, must be interpreted and clarified in accordance with the unique legal and physical nature of outer space. In various written submissions to the group, it has been affirmed that international law applies to outer space. However, how international law law applies to this unique environment and to the spatial nature of space activities is different from domains on Earth. Dear Chairperson, we submit that the clarification of how existing law applies to the weaponization of outer space and military activities in outer space is timely and vital. Though we understand the UN Charter applies to outer space, what does it mean to conduct space activities in accordance with, for instance, prohibition on a threat or use of force? What does it mean to carry on space activities in accordance with principles of non-intervention? What does armed attack mean in space when it's possible that states may perceive an attack as involving non-connected means and methods of causing damage or harm? Could, for instance, a state unilaterally perceive the duration and intensity of a rendezvous and proximity operation or the spoofing at of electromagnetic communication signals as amounting to an armed attack. The clarification of binding legal norms have direct relevance to many of the issues under consideration by the group in identifying and reducing space threats. In this regard, we at the McGill Center, together with a consortium of international partner institutions have been developing the McGill Manual on International Law, applicable to military uses of outer space. Select rules of the manual are annexed to our written submission for the benefit of the working group. What a manual and detailed commentaries on fundamental principles of international law as they apply to outer space will be available in the latter half of 2022. We believe the clarification of key principles international law is necessary to fill in the gaps in relation to the regulation of space weaponization and military space activities. We recommend that efforts for the clarification and restatement of international law as it currently exists be undertaken and continuously carried out. An international and independent group of experts should be convened for this specific purpose. And having extensive experience and knowledge in this regard, we'll be happy to participate in this group if invited. To conclude, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the chairperson. for inviting civil society institutions to contribute to the pressing discussions of the working group. Dear trade person, we reiterate that principles of existing international law are applicable to all space activities, including military space activities and that all testing or use of weapons must be consistent with existing international rules and principles, particularly the principle of due regard prior consultation in the event of potential harmful interference. and conducting space activities for the benefit of and in entrance of all countries. We underline that existing international law as it applies to outer space must be interpreted and clarified in accordance with the unique legal and physical nature of outer space. I end with the wise words of US Ambassador Goldberg who in 1966 said it is quote. a matter of utmost necessity that the space age should continue to evolve in an environment of peace, law and cooperation, and that political conflict on Earth need not inhibit the development of a meaningful legal regime, government and the activities of men and states elsewhere."" I thank you for your attention. I thank... Juan Weichen, Executive Director of the McGill Research Center, a very interesting aeronautical and space exposition. I now give the floor to Professor David Koploff from the Department of Law at Georgetown University. You have the floor.",4
S1M112,1,1,Japan,"Thank you very much for your kind introduction. Thank you so much for giving me the... the opportunity to talk on the subject of how can the principle of dual regard be applied to address threats arising from state behaviors with respect to outer space. My name is Setsuko Aoki, Professor of Law at Keio University Law School, Tokyo, Japan. It is not sufficiently recognized that the Outer Space Treaty, the most important treaty in the field of international space law, has an effective principle of dual regard to substantially mitigate threats. arising from state behaviors with respect to outer space. The first sentence of Article 9 provides that states parties to the treaty shall be guided by the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance and shall conduct all their activities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other states parties to the treaty. Article 9 has other three sentences providing obligations to avoid harmful contaminations in outer space and adverse changes of the Earth's environment. The obligation to seek a prior international consultation when a state is likely to cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other states. And the right of a state to request consultation to the state which is likely to cause potentially harmful interference with its space activities. The obligation of dual regard is independent of these three obligations and the right, and as such, the meaning and the criteria to apply dual regard obligation have to be analyzed independently. Reading only the first sentence of Article 9 leads to the understanding that dual regard is self-restraint in space activities on the part of state parties based on reciprocity, equality of states, and it is strengthened by the obligation of international cooperation. This interpretation is reinforced by other articles of the outer space treaty that reassures the legal obligation of the common interests and the freedom of space activities on the basis of equality. As due regard is clearly mentioned as a legal obligation in Article 9, non-compliance with due regard in a specific space activity would be the violation of the outer space treaty that could lead to the pursuit of international responsibility of the state attributable to that violation. A new legally binding instrument is not needed to pursue international responsibility. This merit should not be underestimated. However, but relatively less attention has been paid to do regard to international space flow up until now. The meaning contents or criteria to determine dual regard is not clear enough to directly apply this test to address threats in outer space activities. Therefore, with the help of other fields of international law that have established the dual regard rule for allocating responsibility between relevant states, the meaning and the criteria of dual regard obligation is presented. Then necessary measures and steps. for the effective application of dual regard in space activities will be contemplated. Looking at other fields of international law, with respect to treaties, due regard obligation was first appeared in the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, which provides that states parties undertake that state aircraft shall have a due regard for the safety of civil aviation. The term due regard is found about 10 times in the United Nations Among which the reference to high seas freedoms that shall be exercised with due regard for the interest of other states seems to have a close resemblance to due regard obligations specified in the outer space treaty. Similar terminology, reasonable regard is also used in the low of the sea convention and the high seas convention and it is assessed that due regard and reasonable regard. have the same implications. Thus, state practice on the criteria of reasonable regard is also a useful reference for thinking about the space, well, due regard for space activities. Fisheries jurisdiction case of the International Court of Justice, as well as some cases in international arbitration and international tribunal for the law of the sea, are quite useful to study the meaning and the methods of the application of due regard. Besides, International Committee on the Red Cross has assessed dual regard obligations as a rule of customary international law to the protection and the preservation of natural environment during armed conflict. Its commentary is also useful in considering the regard test applicable to space activities. and the criteria of due regard as below. For saving time on each finding, I also add space law perspectives. Concerning space law perspectives, I think it has to be especially taken note of that outer space is unique, as David already mentioned, as the whole area is that beyond national jurisdiction and its environment is vulnerable. For instance, towards the generation of space debris that might stay several decades or more, and that would adversely affect any orbit activities. Besides, the outer space treaty in general, and specifically Article 9, expressly underline the strengthened obligation of international cooperation among states parties. These points are not necessarily found in other fields of international law. The first finding is that due regard is a duty of self restraint in exercising the rights given to all or multiple states due regard as a duty is similar to the prohibition of an abuse of rights strong as a free strain may be required in space activities owing to the strength and obligation of international cooperation. The second finding is that you regard is a balancing mechanism between states. that have identical rights, such as the freedom of navigation, or different conquering rights, such as the right of the fishing and the right of military maneuver, or even the colliding rights and duties. The third finding is that duty of due regard is satisfied if a state exercises its right without resulting in any unjustifiable interference with the rights of other states. The question of what is an unjustifiable interference should be ideally answered through the interpretation of Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty. But it is not expected as due regard principle has not been actively used by states parties. But this may change once states are determined to use due regard as a tool. to regulate responsible behaviors in outer space for subsequent state practice would not only determine the treaty interpretation, but also clarify the criteria of the duty of due regard. We already have a precedent concerning the interpretation of potentially harmful interference with activities of other state parties provided in Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty. At the time of drafting, It was understood radio and electronic interference resulting from various innovative military tests started in early 1960s. Since around the mid 1990s, however, generating space debris became the central subject of potentially harmful interference by states parties. And the legal obligations to mitigate space debris had been gradually established. urged by the shared recognition and helped by various technically based guidelines, including especially the 2007 space debris mitigation guidelines endorsed by the UN General Assembly, increasing the number of states today have national regulatory frameworks for implementing space debris mitigation. The same path is quite possible for a dual regard principle if maintaining responsible behavior. is believed to observe dual-regard obligation, and state practices accumulated with the help of detailed guidelines and implementing national regulatory frameworks, dual-regard would be effectively applied to space activities. In this regard, the 2019 Long-Term Sustainability Guidelines would appropriately help state practice. The first finding is that states often exercises, regulatory and enforcement actions to satisfy the dual regard obligation. This also applies to space activities, especially because duty of dual regard to other countries cannot be attained only by the actions and omissions of governmental agencies due to increased privatization of outer space and inherently dual use nature of space activities. Finally, The fifth finding is that the standard of due regard in each case is determined by the specific circumstances and the nature of rights exercised by states. This has to be identified in dispute settlement mechanisms. In the future, space law may need dispute settlement mechanisms, in addition to prior consultation in Article 9. However, this doesn't seem fit at present. As a conclusion, I'd like to emphasize two things. First, dual regard is a legal obligation for States parties to abide by. In other words, we already have a legally binding tool to pursue international responsibility against the violation of dual regard. Second, accumulated state practice will make responsible behaviors in space activities dual regard obligations for States already existent. The long-term sustainability guidelines and increasing national regulatory frameworks to implement them will help develop methods of how most effectively due regard to principle be applied to state behaviors. Thank you very much for your kind attention. I- I f- I thank Professor Setsuko Aoki from the Department of Law of the University of Keio for her very interesting presentation. I now give the floor to the delegations who would have comments to formulate or questions. I see that the representative of Cuba is asking for the floor. I'm sure his speech will be of the utmost importance. Go ahead.",4
S1M113,1,1,Cuba,"Thank you Mr. President. First of all, I would like to thank you for organizing this round table made up of eminent experts. I will have two preliminary comments to formulate. I will also have a question to ask the speakers. First of all, I understand that this is an informal session. You have chosen the subject of this meeting, but we find it a shame that we are only concerned with the behavior of the states as part of point 1, while the behavior of other actors has an effect on the situation. And perhaps a wider point of view could have come to feed our reflections. It is also unfortunate that for financial considerations, especially that we know, we have not been able to count on the interpretation in the official six languages ​​of interventions as interesting. It is unfortunate that we spend resources and time in this type of session while our interpreters are there in the cabin and that they cannot do their work. This type of exchange could be useful for representatives, for capital representatives, for other actors who do not necessarily master English. The principle of multilingualism is a principle that we defend, of course, and I am sure that you will help us to solve this problem for the upcoming sessions, by organizing our meetings in another format, so that these extremely interesting knowledge is not lost in other languages. We sometimes have an interpretation service for meetings whose topics are less specific and important than those of this morning. I thank the speakers for their interventions and I would like to refer now to some of the elements that have been mentioned. First of all, I thank the first speaker for his excellent commentary which summarized with brillo the way in which the principle of good faith must be applied. in all areas of law, including space. I would like to know if from his point of view and that of the other speakers, we can interpret the application of other principles to this light. I think of the principle of precaution, the principle of responsibility in the event of damage, principles that exist in the international law of the environment. Can these principles apply in space? So can we not limit ourselves to this principle of good faith, the principle of the prohibition of use of force, but are there other principles, so I repeat the principle of precaution or of an objective responsibility in the event of damage can apply to the principles that are used in the context of the environment? Second question, more relevant in my opinion, in relation to the subject that occupies us. I would like to know what is the criterion used by the intervenents in the framework of the application of the principle of a peaceful use of space, principle taken in existing treaties. I would like to know if from the point of view of the intervenents, this principle is not a clear prohibition. to install weapons, to deploy weapons or military systems in space. Since this principle that exists in treaties should not be interpreted in a broad way on the legal level. I understand that from a legal point of view, this principle of the peaceful use of space and celestial bodies may be used in a reduced manner. The only thing that is forbidden to deploy in space are weapons of mass destruction. This is a specific, concrete ban in terms of international law, but there is a broader principle. the principle of peaceful use of space and celestial bodies. I would like to know from the point of view of the speakers how this principle can be applied in a wider way, if it can be applied in a wider way. And if we could understand in this case that it forbids the use of all types of weapons in space or on celestial bodies or that it forbids all military use of space. I thank you. Sorry for keeping the speech for so long. I thank the representative of Cuba. for your questions and comments. I would like to say that we have received good feedback from you. As the president of this group, I completely agree with the Cuban representative regarding the importance of multilingualism. And we will continue to provide interpretation services in official languages within our meetings. especially for what is formal in our meetings. In this context, the interpretation services are of course provided. I will now give the floor to our experts so that they can answer the questions raised. This question was for the first experts, Professor Chen, if I'm not mistaken. I thank the representatives of Cuba for this brilliant observation and for their kind words. I believe that the first question was about the application of the principle of good faith in space, and whether it is about space activities. The question was whether principles such as the principle of precaution would apply to the extra-atmospheric space. My answer would be yes, as I said, and as it was said in our written contributions. The space activities, including the armament of the space, including the military space activities, or more precisely the activities of military nature that take place in space or towards space or from space, do not appear. nowhere. They are inscribed in a wider context and are conditioned by the existing law. You have mentioned the importance of clarifying the international law regarding spatial activities and the application of the law to the physical and legal nature of the extra-atmospheric space. So yes, I think the principle of precaution applies to Earth. and in the extra-atmospheric space. In the next few days and during the planned sessions, we have been trying to clarify how, for example, this precautionary principle applies to the extra-atmospheric space. This is your second question now, which is based on the principles of the Pacific uses of the extra-atmospheric space. It has been explained by different States. This is a non-aggressive Pacific way. This does not prevent the application of the rights and obligations under the United Nations Charter, and especially the right to legitimate defense. There is also a wide consensus on this subject. What is forbidden, however, is to deploy weapons in the space of the atmosphere. And once again... I would like to engage the working group to shed light on the application of international law and the importance of applying international law in good faith, especially in the context of certain activities such as deploying particularly aggressive weapons in space, which would represent a violation of norms that apply to space activities, including the principle of taking into account I hope I have answered the questions of the delegate of Cuba. Thank you. I thank Professor Chen for his answer. I don't see any other requests for comment.",4
S1M114,1,1,France,"La France demande la parole. Thank you very much Mr. President. Hello everyone. I am very happy to participate in this work in a venue where we can finally see everyone without a mask. Well, almost everyone, I was going to say without a mask. It changes a lot from previous meetings and it is very pleasant I must say. I would like to thank the panelists for their very interesting presentation. In particular, I would like to thank the first panelist, Mr. Ram-Jacques Cuch. for his presentation and for the publications, especially to come, and especially what he mentioned about the question of the manuals. I understand that there is one that has already been published and one that is to come. We are looking forward to it, because I think it will be very useful to feed our work. And I must say that the presentation he made is quite consistent with the paper that we will submit to this group, precisely on the legal and normative framework applicable to space. I apologize, by the way, Mr. President, this paper should have been distributed a little earlier, but we had a... and it took us some time to finalize it, and we hope to submit it to the Secretariat today or later tomorrow. Regarding Mr. Koploff's presentation, I would like to ask him a question. This presentation was very interesting, although a bit radical in the interpretation of the DIH. Our interpretation of the DIH is not quite the same. We talk a lot about the question of the DIH. in the war in Ukraine. And I have to say that his interpretation of the D.I.H. poses a lot of questions. He proposes, in particular, to make a distinction in space, in space objects for military purposes and space objects for civil purposes, if I understand his thesis well, I would like to ask him if he took into account, in this possible distinction, the industrial impact, the financial impact The reality of industrial integration is between the civil industry, the military industry, the industries that do both. Many industries have dual activities. And did he take into account in his proposal the difficulty in research and development, to make precise distinctions between military-oriented technologies and civil-oriented technologies. I think this is a fundamental question. For us, it seems difficult to go in this direction because of the industrial reality, globalized by the way, which is in progress. Last point Mr. President, I would like to just add to what was said by our fellow Cuba on multilingualism. I must say that I do not understand the financial argument so much. Multilingualism is very important, we have talked a lot about inclusivity. I think that in order for everything to be understood, we need an interpretation in the six languages of the United Nations. The panelists spoke for more than 30 minutes and I think that according to the financial rules of the United Nations, the interpreters were paid for 30 minutes, continued to be paid. So why didn't they translate it? I am not... I am sure to understand and I would like to have clarifications from the secretary on this point so that for the next session which will involve panelists, it is possible to have a translation in the six languages. Thank you very much Mr. President. I thank them. We will do our best to ensure the interpretation during the next sessions. Personally, I agree with the importance of multilingualism. It's a central element. We will try to mobilize the technical means. I don't understand myself what's going on, but we will make sure that the interpretation is provided for the next sessions. If I'm not mistaken, this question is addressed to Professor Koploff. Professor Koploff, you have the floor.",2
S1M116,1,1,Russian,"Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to thank all the experts. of their edifying exposures. They raised essential questions. I have some observations, observations that I would like to explain to my colleagues. Our colleague from Cuba raised a very important question regarding the applicability of the principle of pacific use of the The answer from the representative of the McGill Center. on how to interpret this principle. He explained to us what was hidden behind the notion of peaceful use. His answer was that it was a non-aggressive use of space. I think that here we should not be confined to this simple interpretation. To be honest, in my opinion, this interpretation... is not consistent with what is happening in the extra-atmospheric space. I propose to look at the application of the principle of peaceful use of space through the prism of potential threats that could emerge in space. And in this regard, there is, for example, the armament of space, the deployment of weapons in space. which represents a real threat of the use of these weapons. We don't know if these weapons are deployed defensively or offensively. The fact, simply put, that there are weapons in space, represents a threat. And from then on, the creation of such a threat cannot be considered as conforming to the international space law. I would therefore like to know here what the representative of the McGill Center thinks. And second question. which certainly also addresses the first speakers. When we talk about the enormous principles of international space law, can we talk about the hierarchy between these principles? I think that the principle of pacific use of the extra-atmospheric space is the fundamental element. It must be at the top of this pyramid. I think we need to approach these principles in their whole, but between principles and norms, there are principles... qui sont... the stone of assis, the examination of all the problems in space, whether it is the use of space, or the problems concerning, for example, the risk of a arms race in space. So these are the two questions I wanted to ask you. Thank you.",4
S1M118,1,1,Mexico,"Thank you for the excellent organization of this round table. It was interesting to be able to listen to these presentations of excellent level and we wish to support multilingualism. I had a few questions to ask the representatives of the McGill University. I apologize, I don't have his name under my eyes. He explained that the legal regime of space is particular. that it takes up international law as well as a specific law and that it forces us to interpret international legal law in general, especially when it comes to the peaceful use of space and the respect of the common heritage of humanity. My specific question is the following. 7. This common heritage of humanity, which is one of the characteristics of the extra-atmospheric space. is such a characteristic that pushes us to protect it for future generations. I would like to know how this criterion is understood within the framework of the right to govern space. For Dr. Coppeau's presentation, it seemed quite interesting, especially in the way he links the principle of distinction in space. However, I would like to know if you have made an analysis of the complications that come from the application of the principle of proportionality. It's a subject that interests us, I would like to know if you have paid attention to this point. And finally, for Professor Setsuko Aoki, I thank you for this presentation concerning the principle of the reasonable application of presentation. I would like to know if... How do you link between this principle and the dispositions I would say that apply only to private actors? Thank you.",2
S1M120,1,1,Austria,"Thank you, Mr. President. Since this is the first time that Austria is speaking, we wish you a happy occasion to be able to attend the presidency of this working group. We wish you a full success and we give you all the support from Austria. What's more, I also thank the experts for their very enlightening presentations about this matter of thought that they have offered us for our debates for the rest of the week. I also have a question for Dr. Dr. Kupplow, is nature a dual use of spatial and the application of the distinction principle is what he calls the inverted distinction for spatial objects. According to the Austrian, the capacity of the use of these knowledge represents one of the challenges in the development of a legally challenging instrument. Therefore, I would like to know to what extent the Convention on the Matriculation of objects thrown into space and the obligation to transmit information on spatial objects would be a solution to the question of double usage. Is it perhaps a starting point to consider? Maybe this is a point that could be improved. I would like to know if Professor Koploff and the others can give us more information on this subject. Thank you. I thank the representative of the Autriche for this question and for its precious support brought to the Presidency. There are two more speakers on my list. I would like to conclude. I see that India also asks for the floor. I propose to end with India. Then we will move on to the answers. I ask here that you show understanding, since experts are in different schedules. It is very late for some of them, so we cannot continue for hours. On that note, I give the floor. in the United States. You have the floor.",2
S1M121,1,1,United States,"Thank you, Mr. President. This question is addressed to Professor Aoki. This is a very interesting debate on the principle of accountability, and in particular, it is good to explain that it is difficult to define this principle in all cases, but as explained by the Professor, it is a norm that must be defined according to the circumstances and according to the rights that could be invoked in the different situations. This is a good starting point, while we embark on this effort. My question is the following. The practice of the States can make responsible behavior a norm for taking into account the fact that the law of the law is not a norm. How can we contribute to the development of responsible behavior and thereby develop norms in this sense? And so, that's my question. Thank you. I thank the distinguished... I thank the representative of the United States for this question. We will now move on to the representative of Pakistan. Is that? Thank you very much. beyond the existing international law, the United Nations Charter, etc. If we look at the articles 1 and 3 of the Space Treaty, which talk about the use of space, then when we think about this use, without talking about weapons deployment, what I would like to understand is We are talking about a benefit-based use of all, while we can have a double use of space. Is article 51 of the UN Charter... but a break to other existing international instruments. How can we consider that the deployment of offensive or defensive weapons can be in the interest of humanity and all countries in the world? Since we know that there are rivalries on Earth that do not disappear in space. So how can the actions of a country in this field not be considered as a threat to another? Second idea I would like to come back to. When we study the question of skills in space... offensive capabilities can be multiplied by what exists on Earth. Is this use of space not offensive by nature? Is this not against the obligations of the Pacific use of space without even coming back to the nature of the weapons that would be used? Thank you. I thank the representative of Pakistan for this question. I have an additional request for words from India and Portugal. I will ask you to stop the list of requests for words here. I now give the floor to India.",2
S1M122,1,1,India,"Thank you Mr. President, this is the first time that my delegation is speaking. I wish you congratulations for your election to the presidency of this group and for the way you managed our meeting so far. I thank the speakers for their very interesting presentations. I have a question for Dr. Copelot. You spoke about the principle of distinction between civil and military in armed conflicts. This is a topic that is debated within the United Nations. The Security Council, if I understood correctly, has a complete procedure on this subject, especially on what concerns children in armed conflicts. A plea in favor of sanctions took place if... in which these principles are not respected. My question is the following. Do you see a divergence in the application of this principle in the Security Council or in other instances of creation of international law?",2
S1M124,1,1,Portugal,"Thank you, Mr. President. I will keep my question for a while. I greet all the speakers whose remarks have been extremely interesting and will be very useful for the exchanges this afternoon on the first subject. I have a question for Professor Satsuko Aoki. Thank you for being with us even if it is very late at home. the space and the reinforced presence of private actors. I have a question for Professor Aoki. Could you come back to the principle of taking into account the responsibility of the States in terms of the elements controlled by this State? I would also like to come back to the responsibility of the States, especially Article 8. which states that the behavior of an individual or a group of individuals must be considered as the action of the state as a part of the international law if this individual or group of individuals act on order or under the control of this state. I thank the speakers and the performers for their patience.",3
S1M126,1,1,Couplot,"Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I would like to congratulate you and the work group for your commitment, for the depth of the questions and comments that have been asked. This is the first session of your work group. All this is very reassuring. It is reassuring to see that you are full of energy, of commitment, that you are showing creativity. As an observer... This gives me confidence, this gives me a reason to hope. I think you will have the opportunity to fulfill the demands of the General Assembly. concerning the principles of space preservation. I will answer several of the comments that have been posed, by reminding you first of all that... There are two complementary methods in principle that allow us to complete international law and principles on space security. The first method is to interpret in a creative way and to reinforce the existing texts, the principles that we know and that we can apply. in a new form and in a creative way in space. The second way is to create new legislation. I remind you that these two methods are important to them, and that they can be used in a complementary way. I think that this group could have important contributions to make in these two areas. A large part of today's discussions focused on the use of reinforced terms and existing documents, such as the Space Treaty or other elements of international law. So, using existing principles that we know that can be applied in new or better forms. I support this principle, but international law, in my opinion, is found in a situation of blockade in relation to space because we do not see new legally-constraining instruments that have been developed over the last decades. This is a problem. A problem that we must address in the near future. I will now move on to the specific question that was asked about my presentation and which was asked by Brazil and taken up by others. There are many ways in which we can take advantage of this. whose double use of space cannot be separated. Sometimes, a single satellite is used for military and civil purposes, and these activities cannot be separated. But in some circumstances, this separation is feasible. This is not always the case, but it is sometimes possible to separate these activities. And as for the right to armed conflicts, there is no category concerning this double use of the right to armed conflicts. Any object is either a civilian or a military object. If an object is used in a double way, then it is a military object that is likely to be targeted. I think there are cases of violation of this law. I think especially in the case where we could have a satellite that would be composed of civil and military elements. We could have two transponders, for example, one for military objectives, one for civil objectives, but which would be operated from the same satellite. Well, from my point of view, it is a choice that has been made. The option existed and the country chose to have in the same satellite these two functions. This is where I believe that the right to armed conflicts must avoid, in my opinion. If we can separate these two objects, in a GPS it is not possible, but in many other contexts it is. As many of you know, identifying an object as a military target is not the final point of the military analysis. Then we have the principle of proportionality. If we have an attack or a prepared attack against a military target, we must also evaluate the collateral damage, If there is disproportionality between the military objectives achieved and the civilian losses, then we cannot lead to a good attack or not. In this way, by that time, the situation must be reviewed in order to ensure that the principle of proportionality is respected. This is the next step in the military analysis. Identify a target. military, it's a first step, but it's not the only one. I think there is also a point in which we did not pay enough attention today, which is that the treaty on space creates an unusual regulation in terms of international law regarding private and commercial activities. In traditional international law, in most cases, a state is not held as responsible for the actions of those who leave. If you are injured, if you suffer damage to an individual or a company, it is this individual or this company who is responsible and not the state in which this state or this company is resourcing. In this case, the state is not responsible for the harmful actions of its survivors. Whereas in this treaty, there is a different regulation. It is considered that the state is responsible for activities in the space of its survivors. This regulation, because it is different, means that in space, the actions of private entities are the result of the state they are from. It is sometimes difficult to say what is the responsible state, but in any case, we have a reinforced obligation in terms of the peaceful use of space beyond state actors, an obligation that extends to private actors. I will keep it there, thank you. I thank Professor Coplo for his intervention. You gave us very relevant and understandable information. And finally, I give the floor to Professor Setsuko Aoki for her answers.",2
S1M127,1,1,Canada,"Thank you. Professor Copelot, I think, has answered the first question that was asked. I think the second is a double question. So yes, private actors... must operate under the supervision and authorization of the states. And the principle of reasonable consultation must be taken into account by the states to ensure that private actors But the national authorities must observe the rules of...",3
S1M22,1,2,Secretary,"Thank you, Mr. President. I have a request for you this morning. That is, I would like to clarify the issue of the issue of the long-term speech and the issue of the translation. If my speech is in French... I want to speak French to reflect our multilingualism. If we can participate remotely, we can still translate it in order to allow such a language. But there are rules that need to be applied. That is, according to the current rules of the United Nations, all participation remotely exceeds 30% short, it shouldn't be two hours. If we have a long time to participate, which is more than three minutes, in this case, we have to turn this meeting into two hours. So we have to follow the rules. We should try to use the meeting time of three hours to use the time of speech. This is also the fact that everyone knows that the audio quality of the audio recording is very poor. And the voice recording is still in the United Nations. So, if we say that the audio recording is 30 minutes long, then we have to shorten the meeting to 23 hours. Thank you for your understanding. Thank you very much. Thank you for your explanation. I want to confirm all the efforts made to respect the rules of multilateralism and to have a formal discussion, a one-to-five discussion, which is general communication. After this, which is this issue, After the speech, we will have some representatives to attend the debate. If you have any questions, you can also add them to the general debate. Before the speech, I would like to invite the International Financial Research Institute, the Red Cross, Please come and introduce a work document. This is my invitation. So now I will first invite the US military's research institute.",2
S1M23,1,2,United States,"President, representatives of all the representatives of the work group, we have prepared a work document which is about our arrangement. Our purpose is to introduce some of the safety regulations. which is the work of the team, which is to summarize the international law and the framework of these harmful air activities. What I am saying in my resolution is not completely true, but at least I want to Tell everyone about some meaningful situations to help you understand. We have to follow the rules of the principle of the art. First of all, I would like to talk about space rights. This morning I said that the basis of space law is the space law. This morning we have heard that there are three, four, and nine. international law, and to prevent or to use large-scale kill weapons in the air, and to ask the country to consider it thoroughly. After the air-outside treaty, we have passed other treaties, which also involve air safety. This also involves the principles we have designed. The United Nations has finally passed several statements and principles. For example, the basic principles of airspace behavior. After the airspace agreement was reached, we should consider the issue of airspace safety. In recent years, two government working groups have been established in various countries. We have heard that the government experts' group made this morning. The purpose of our two groups is to promote illegal practices involving the military competition. This is also discussed every year at the Lian Dazhi Medical Commission. And some resolutions have also been passed. The resolution No. 7365 is the document established by this working group. the safety of the outer space. These agreements have or do not have any constraints. They should be bilateral or multilateral, and they are designed to protect the outer space. Although these agreements themselves are not only about the outer space, for example, the rules of the nuclear power plant, and the other ballistic weapons, are also applicable to international law. Today morning, we have heard Article 1 and 2, which show that international law is applicable to the space. So, apart from the existing laws and regulations, we have also heard Article 1 and 2, which show that international law is applicable to the space. So, apart from the existing The document provided by the Ministry of Finance is related to the current international rules. The document is related to the current international rules. under the legal framework, should not cause damage. This is completely against the prohibition of harmful pollution, which is the content of Article 1. At the same time, there is also a law that requires the use of force. Especially the fourth one, which is the only one that is banned from using force, which is the 51st one. The Sun Law applies to the rules of outer space. This is often related to outer space. This can be explained by this. This law should be applied to some concepts. For example, it should be fully considered or must protect the signal of communication. and solve the problem. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the the legal framework has already existed. This is the foundation of our group's suggestions. The documents of the Ministry of Finance and the documents of the Red Cross are mainly to give you a meaningful framework to help this group to complete its work. Obviously, the Ministry of Finance is ready to support this work group so that it can better understand it. by foreign countries. Thank you. Thank you, the UN Thank you,",4
S1M24,1,2,Hong,"Mr. President and Representative Hong. First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Lagos. Congratulations on being the chairman of the Invisible Members' Working Group and reducing the threat of the Invisible Members' Working Group. We appreciate your work. Please believe that we will fully support you. The WUCC will also have the opportunity to use our professional skills in this discussion. In addition to our humanitarian and some special occasions, we have already submitted a work document to take further measures to prevent the airspace competition. Despite the long-term hope of our international community to explore and use the airspace system in peace. has been used for military purposes. Considering the military system, it can be used in armed conflicts, it can be used in attacks, and it can also be used in ground space and other military activities related to the two. This can cause a huge impact on the people on Earth. Because technology involves human life, this may cause potential threats, which may lead to some humanitarian concerns. Therefore, it is very important for us to make the decision of entering the country to carry out air-to-air military activities. This activity should not be carried out under a legal vacuum. We are committed to the international law and the Air-to-Air Treaty, and the resolution of Article 76.231.1. We have already explained in detail in our official documents the specific international law. I want to briefly mention a few federal bans. This is a law that stipulates that the country's legal bans on the use of force are prohibited. That is, it is necessary to resolve disputes through peaceful means. especially the Foreign Affairs Law, which involves the use of foreign affairs in peace. And some prohibition measures or restrictions are established, which means that some weapons or other military actions must be deployed. Third, the Sino-Lithuanian law involves the situation when the Sino-Lithuanian and the conflict countries are at conflict. And it can slow down the consequences of conflict. Fourth, the International Human Rights Law, which is the Weap Act, has already established some restrictions on the choice of weapons by the warring parties. It should protect the common people and the common target, which is a danger from military activities. The International Human Rights Law also clearly prohibits... the prohibition of killing innocent people. It also involves some specific weapons. Our document has explained that the International Humanitarian Law involves any military action, including any activities in the air or outside the air during the conflict, including the International Humanitarian Law, and the principle of discrimination. and completely banning the attack of the outer space weapon. It will destroy the outer space object. From a practical point of view, and then the member state Making the following commitments will contribute to this work. First, no second test, deploy weapons, and carry out any work in the air, including anti-aircraft, anti-aircraft missiles, strike, land or air targets, and eliminate all existing systems. 4. Do not test, deploy or use space weapons. Put them in the anti-aircraft system. Use them to strike targets in space. 4. Do not destroy, damage or destroy the space. the operation and track of other foreign objects. Six, it does not help any country to incite any international group, international government, or any non-governmental organization, including non-governmental legal entities, whether it is in the establishment, registration, and local judicial jurisdiction. can become an important step to help us prevent the air defense from being closed, and prevent the deployment of weapons in the air to make the air defense a new battlefield. If we do not guarantee that the air-to-air weapons will not be used, and if we do not write it in the international document of the June Law, which is to prevent air-to-air military competitions, then peace will be used to ensure air-to-air activities and safety. In our view, this kind of work will certainly fail. The basis of this document can be the central balance of the law and the prevention of weapons deployed in the outer space. to use and threaten the outer space objects. 预防在外空部署武器。 由至于我们预防。 and the air. This is a real possibility. The West is leading the US in the fight against the Chinese. The US is leading the US in the fight against the Chinese. and the facilities in the air. The air is used as a military site to ensure its superiority and to ensure its cohesion. They have developed a wide range of weapons systems. Their purpose is to use and threaten the use of force against objects in the outer space and outer space. This behavior has a negative and unstable impact on international peace and security and may cause a situation of instability. and strengthen the air defense. This situation will seriously weaken the possibility of eliminating and reducing weapons. We call on Western countries to stop and try to use air defense as a place for competition and conflict. to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Our priority is to warn all representatives to take note of the importance of the UN Security Council's non-核心性问题, we remind you that the entire series of issues that the UN Security Council's 7.6协定231 resolution involves, including the issue of the broken outer space, are within the scope of the UN Security Council's nuclear use of outer space. The organization has successfully solved this problem. The authorization of the Any transparent and reliable outdoor activities should be limited to First, completely prohibiting the use of outdoor weapons to prevent the use of outdoor objects or to use them It should be replaced by a law that does not replace the effective outdoor air-prevention competition to maintain international peace, to ensure fairness and security, and to ensure the sustainability of the country's exploration and use of space activities. These activities are for peace. We need international cooperation. We must first deploy weapons in space. We fully participate in this initiative and have deployed weapons in the outside world, including more than 30 countries. We call on the United Nations and other member states to join this initiative. The Russian Federation. 期待不幸成功做足。 to the country. 推进实用发展 The document includes the guarantee of the use of weapons in the air, and the use or threat of weapons in the air.

In the space, creating conditions to raise a few countries causes the tension to increase and causes the international community to split. no equal opportunity to use the space for peace. Taking this kind of measures, without the law of the law, the space will be cut off. This will prevent weapons from being used and cause serious threats, and will damage the military and international security.",4
S1M26,1,2,China,"Thank you, Mr. Lin. I am honored to represent the East China Alliance and the member states to speak again. First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Ambassador Lagos, for being the chairman of the working group, and for doing an important job at the Secretariat. Please rest assured that we will support you with all our heart. Mr. Zhu, the East China Alliance... We know that entering outer space is an unparalleled right of all nations. We believe that exploration and the use of outer space should only be for the sake of peace and harmony, and in line with the collective interests of mankind. All activities outside the space must comply with the international law and the law of the universe. the principle of using the outer space appropriately. We reiterate that the importance of the prohibition of the use of the outer space and the preparation and preparation of the disbandment of the defense and the continued improvement of the defense is critical. We urge all members of the member states to respect and ensure that all related UN documents and related joint resolutions are fully implemented. Highly concerned about the East China Alliance. international peace and security, and threats. This is because the outer space may become a weaponized or a military battlefield. We emphasize that the need to start a practical trial at the forum to make a document that has legal limitations and multiple checks to prevent the spread of the air force including prohibiting the deployment of weapons in the air and prohibiting the use or threat of weapons against the air We can continue to confirm that we need a to deal with missile issues in a comprehensive and comprehensive way. This is discussed in the UN. Any relevant interests must be considered to ensure the security of each country and the right to use space technology in a peaceful manner. Thank you for your attention. related to the international cooperation between the United Nations and the United Nations. They are important platforms to promote international cooperation between the United Nations and the United Nations. All countries have the obligation to ensure that the use and exploration of the outer space are peaceful. The United Nations must play a core role in promoting the peace of the world. to continue our dialogue and discuss the issues and challenges. In this respect, I welcome the establishment of the J-1 Open Work Group. It was established in accordance with the resolution of the 7.6 space and technology are beneficial to the economy. It is clear that the activities of the space should not be the privilege of a few countries. We urge all countries, especially those with space capabilities, to actively promote the defense of space and military competition. As a condition, we will promote international cooperation, development and use of space to achieve a peaceful goal of maintaining international peace and security. The East Bank has encouraged and strengthened the capacity-building plan, especially emphasized the development of the country, and guaranteed that the outer space is a truly common property that can be used by all countries in principle and practice. There is no doubt that The opportunity to enter the outer space has also brought greater responsibility to the entire United Nations. It emphasized that it needed a common understanding, and that it needed to accept the rules set by multilateral contact. The working group has the opportunity to propose an understanding of the principles of the International Space Law. to explore and use the principles of space activities, including the moon and other celestial bodies, or the space treaty, and other activities of equal space. The international law applies to the use of space, the deployment of large-scale nuclear weapons, the responsibility of the country, the registration, the responsibility, and international cooperation, etc. We also support other activities and initiatives to deepen our understanding of space security. In our seventh East Mongolia Regional Forum, we have organized a seminar on this. These seminars discuss the core issues in this area, including space security threats, risk, transparency, and new measures. We will continue to support this kind of initiative. Finally, Mr. Chairman, we are exploring one complex issue. At the same time, we call for continuing to reduce the impact of space fragments. Through the relevant international forum, we will promote this issue with all parties.",4
S1M28,1,2,European Union,"Thank you, Mr. President. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the EU. We congratulate you on being the chairman of this group. This group is to reduce the threat of external threats by the principles of the regulations, rules, and responsibilities. We wish you success in your work. I would like to emphasize that we appreciate your efforts to clarify the procedural problem. Today, we will be able to enter into a practical discussion. You will receive our great support. The first meeting of the working group was held on the occasion of the political situation, which made people highly worried. Russia's entry into Ukraine caused serious human rights and human rights crimes and serious humanitarian difficulties. Russia has no reason to... The military entered Ukraine, which is a serious threat to the international law and the international constitution. It has weakened international peace and security. The international community will make Russia responsible for its actions. The EU and its member states fully support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. We firmly stand by the harsh behavior of the attack. Mr. Zhu, the EU and its member states have recognized the existing international framework of foreign affairs. and the legal system in it have taken active action to manage the space activities. However, it should be strengthened to deal with the current security challenges and rapid technological development. Considering the space characteristics, especially the double-use of space-based facilities and the difficulties in the investigation. The European Union has emphasized that We will not rule out the possibility of legal and legal documents in the future. Under these conditions, the most realistic and concrete way to strengthen the foreign policy security, to prevent, to solve and to calculate, is to set up a set of regulations. This involves the behavior of the person in charge and the transparency and credibility of the extra-parliamentary activities. We believe that多邊主義 has been integrated into the core. We believe that We must take action quickly, and discuss a global, shared and multilateral plan. We must work together with the United Nations and other relevant organizations. to participate in the discussion work of the Inevitable Employment Group. In this regard, we have already put two joint documents on the website of the team's mystery office. These are all about the team's work. One is a file. The other is a specific one for this meeting. It involves the current law or the current framework. It involves the threat of national behavior in the outside world. We intend to propose two more files. This will be before the next meeting. We will consider the next meeting mainly to consider the threats in the past, and some possible regulations and rules, and some relevant principles. We also need to actively participate in this meeting. This meeting will end this week. I want to express my gratitude to you. Thank you for your very challenging ideas today. We hope that you can give us an introduction when you are asked to do so. Thank you very much. We will support you.",1
S1M210,1,2,China,"I am the representative of the Republic of China, Yan Qinglin. I would like to thank you and thank you for hosting our first OEW meeting to discuss the issue of reducing the threat of external space. We will cooperate with you to help with the entire process and to build a safe and continuous We have four speeches online. I want to take this opportunity to emphasize a few points, considering the space and some activities that are taking place. Our approach determines the threats of space and some measures. This should be based on some monitoring behaviors. We should consider some existing challenges. We should take a comprehensive approach. And we should consider political promises, transparency, and trust measures. The current situation, which is the test, is that we are improving our legal system and taking some concrete actions. When is it possible that we don't do this? It's dangerous. We have to point out that our space is not special. And we can't make compromises to ensure the safety of the space. This test has shown that the behavior of a country to destroy all people's behavior. Korea also welcomes the U.S. commitment to not only test the satellite weapons. This is a responsible act. In the international community, we hope to find a common point to threaten and find some rules and principles. I am very happy to have a discussion with you and to be able to make the meeting successful. Thank you, respected Korean representative. Now, please speak. to see women. First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as the chairman of our working group. At the same time, I would like to assure you that the United States will support your efforts. The United States also hopes to cooperate with you on this very important issue and promises to make this competition a success. At the same time, I would also like to reiterate that we firmly support the Ukrainian government. Ukraine The space for navigation and communications is indeed important to many countries. In order to ensure this kind of progress, to reduce the danger caused by anti-aircraft weapons, to reduce the miscalculation and misunderstanding, the key is that we should take full action to solve these dangers. the truth that cannot be undeniable is that in the past few years we have seen many ground-based anti-satellite missiles. the test destroyed the satellite. We have seen some of the air-based services involved in the satellite navigation and communication. For many years, we have been communicating about the situation of the deployment of weapons in the space. Although these progress tests and blame the international community are not now fully discussed in the public. And this is not only a matter of the space of the country, but also the problem of all countries. the fragments caused by this are no different. And in this regard, we do think that we can make important commitments. The most severe threat to the human race is the human activity on the track. Sometimes it causes the satellite to be damaged. Because of the direct anti-satellite missile test, the result of the military is also a anti-satellite missile. become fragments of the universe. And it is unfeasible. And we can indeed see that a new chain is created outside the planet. This may cause more uncertainty. The tests are not restricted to continue. The participation of countries including the United States can only be further polluted by the outer space and cause fragments to affect all countries' activities. Therefore, on April 18, US Vice President Harris has announced the US commitment to not conduct destructive direct missile tests against satellites. The US believes that this kind of test is too dangerous, and we should end this activity together, and cause space fragments to be involved in the ASET missile test. This has no meaning to anyone. We also promise that this is a preliminary stage, mainly considering the impact this kind of test has on space. If we can fully participate in this kind of commitment, we can be sure, trust or prove that we can make progress in this important field. And we... to solve the risks of this test on the outer space. We are seriously considering the measures we have made. The U.S. believes that these measures can be understood clearly and improve the stability of the outer space environment. We welcome any countries, including Russia, China, and India, to also recognize that this is not only a matter of the interests of the other side, and the anti-satellite test. And we all have to make this kind of commitment. In order to make it clear, we are not just taking one step, we have to strengthen the international security and the stability of space. The United States also admits that this kind of commitment is still limited. This is not the case for all departments. Including the ASET system, which is also a... to eliminate these weapons. But we believe that this is a meaningful first step that is, to use the outside space by all means. And history has shown that to establish this standard, to take responsible actions. This is a commitment that is not a contractual one. This can be further considered as a contractual document of the law. We also welcome everyone here to think about it. This can change the promise. And obviously, we should discuss this issue with the satellite missile. We will continue to do this as a responsible action. We can pay attention to the most urgent threats, and at the same time, we should show that we can make progress. At the same time, we should evaluate other areas and make progress. We believe that through this discussion, we can create new ideas in our own work group and solve many other challenges, which include space, system, and security threats. We hope to have a better conversation and better understanding Thank you, Mr. President, for your understanding and understanding of the situation. I would like to thank the representative of the United States for his speech. I would also like to thank the very precious support of the workers and the chairman. Now I would like to ask the German ambassador to give his speech. President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on your election. Thank you for your efforts to host this work group. We will fully support your work. First of all, I would like to thank the people of the fatherland for their valuable contributions. We also fully support... the European security structure. Russia has called for security in the foreign space for many years. Of course... The Ukraine invasion involves us making a political commitment, which is what Russia itself has already made. To solve the security challenge, we must be very tight in our practical space, considering that our lives are also for the sake of security and prosperity. This is a way of not signing. satellite communications in the global environment and land and sea space and also a timely service space observation to better monitor the environment and climate change reliable and safe space service to everyone and every country we can use together. Safety is indeed threatened. It is mainly a very high level of heat. This military activity involves various types of actions, which may be used in future conflicts. This space is not only for the targeted countries, but also wants to affect all of our civilized life. One example is the Chinese-Chinese service. For example, police or rescue activities, many situations depend on satellite communications and navigation. We have seen the construction or testing of space capabilities, especially directly against satellites, which has caused a kind of destruction. In addition, the network attack... and affect the space system. It also causes the system to be stuck. The most basic challenge of space safety is to consider how to use space technology, the ability and the technology. This is very critical. This will stabilize the space used. For example, when the track is observed, it can be misused. The dual-use space technology which involves communication, transparency, and some activity theory can increase the situation of miscalculation or misunderstanding. Consider that this... and it is possible to use space technology to control and limit the potential danger of objects. We should take the realistic measures to solve all the related threats and safety threats. We need to create some standard rules and principles, which include responsible space behavior, other transparent and reliable measures. This requires more safety and predictability. can prevent external military control, military competition. Chairman, we also see that some areas need some regulations that we urgently need to be developed. One aspect of this is to test anti-aircraft missile. We fully support the American 4-5 commitment. We also have a general standard for banning such activities. The US has promised us that this is a good foundation for further progress in our work group. Other areas need to be prepared for some activities, including the interference of the space system. At the same time, it also involves new measures, such as increasing communication, improving transparency, improving the air quality. Finally, this is also a document that we can establish a full and legal document. The design is to solve the danger of the outer space. In fact, the self-sufficiency measures have already shown us the way. The treaty is a good example and a great decision. So we call on all countries to build up this kind of inclusive process to carry out this work. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Honorable German Ambassador, for your speech. Thank you very much. I would like to thank the President for his valuable support. Now, I would like to invite the Honorable General of Canada to speak. Thank you, Mr. President. We are very happy to see you to organize this work of the Unlimited Staff. We also want to ensure that we fully support you. Before we start speaking, Canada wants to take this opportunity to return to the UN. We must firmly condemn the... President Putin has made a false violation of the principle of the sovereignty of a country. This has broken the rules of international law. We demand that Russia end the hostile behavior against Ukraine. At the same time, we must withdraw all armed forces. Chairman. the tension on the ground. Although the situation is difficult, we have decided to hold a meeting with the workers today to discuss our future ideas. We welcome this meeting. We also believe that our discussions in the next few years will enable us to set a series of standards to ensure the safety of the space. to maintain our future and future space. For 40 years, we have called for a ban on assets. At the same time, we have made hundreds of statements. We are in a consistent and constant position. Today, we are going to establish such a legacy. We are very proud of the United States. to conduct a counter-aircraft weapon test. in a very strong and decided manner, interference in the activities of states who conduct space systems for peaceful purposes must be... We hope to take this opportunity to visit the political hospital. invention. Now I am very happy to welcome you. My friend, Philippine representative, will speak. Thank you, Mr. President, and I congratulate you on your appointment as the president of the working group. I also congratulate you on your outstanding work. You can continue to support us. We also support the speech of Jian Buzhai on behalf of the East China Alliance. We also hope to introduce ourselves. This is a key factor in our peace and security. We also hope to work on national issues and to enhance our presence in this area. This is our goal. key challenges to our long-term social and economic resilience, including how to mitigate the effects of climate change, which is an existential issue for our country as it is with many other states. This explains the high importance that the Philippines attaches to this collective exercise seeking to reduce space threats to norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior. Mr. Chair, we very much welcome the inclusive approach of the Open-ended Working Group. Discussions on norms, rules, and principles should not be exclusive to states with major seafaring capabilities or to regional organizations with advanced normative governance frameworks on outer space. As noted by Ambassador Patriota this morning, the world has evolved from the 60th year of the 20th century that gave rise to the existing league of This is because... foreign technology used in modern society. This kind of inclusive approach is indeed considered. and the interests and hopes of all parties, as well as the people. I hope this kind of tolerance discussion will help to increase trust. to confirm the power of multilateralism, especially at this time. At the same time, this will help us to improve the international security order. We, the members of the House of Representatives, respect the following position, that the vacuum is not only a global common property, but also a common heritage of mankind. Air countries should work for the people. To use outer space for peaceful purposes. The exercise of this right must take into account the rights and interests of others and preserve space for future generations. Third, protecting outer space also requires us to create legal instruments to prevent an arms race in space. This work must continue. International law has already proposed our understanding of the international air law. This is in the 67th year of the air treaty, which includes equality in all countries. The international law of the world is used in the outside world, not in the domestic and international world. It is the responsibility of the country. to register for international cooperation. We praise you. This is the end of the presentation. Thank you very much. I hope to discuss the matter of due regard that we submitted a few hours ago. To clarify our understanding of the original, this is already an important form of building trust. It creates an environment that promotes our work and peace and stability. We hope that you can participate in this work in a constructive way. Finally, we praise the international organizations, experts, industrial and academic sectors for participating in our work. We believe that their input can enrich our discussion and help us understand the problem and challenge. At the same time, let us see the hope that the public has for us to complete our work. Mr. Ju, we are very happy to see you share this process. We completely believe in your leadership. We will support you with all our heart. I thank the Philippine representative for his speech.

We believe that space is a place for cooperation, not conflict. We oppose space weapons. We do not participate in any space arms competition. All space countries should protect space, and make it a human site. At the same time, the benefits of space technology and technology will be shared with other countries. international agreements and documents on space activities, such as the Space Agreement, Rescue Agreement, registration of contracts, etc. We will continue to implement these regulations. We have identified the framework provided by these agreements to strengthen the space safety. We hope that the discussion in the group can further promote understanding of this framework. India has implemented measures and is working on 21 long-term outer space stability principles. This includes the registration of outer space objects in the United Nations. According to the measures taken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we are also participating in the cross-institution fragments cooperation committee. to analyze the fragments. There are also many other international cooperation. We will advocate and strengthen the implementation of these challenges. The other important thing is to assess regularly. Long-term sustainable challenges, analysis of experiences, and real-time educational and strengthening capabilities, especially the capabilities of developing countries and new air countries, will help us realize that the threat of air safety and sustainability is due to the increase in the number of air activities. We want to launch the diversification of satellites, etc. We promote the impact of the damage to outer space and reduce it. At the same time, we monitor and reduce the damage of data and information exchange with other countries. Considering the global nature of this issue, in strengthening cooperation in different countries, encouraging relevant data sharing and communication. effective supervision and lightening of this activity. For the sake of the safety of the outer space, we believe that all countries must 1. carry out activities in the outer space according to international law, including the UN Charter, to maintain international peace and security, and promote international cooperation. 2. 3 Foreign affairs take on the responsibility of the state, whether it is an activity run by government institutions or non-governmental entities, to ensure that fair, reasonable and effective use of the channels used by the broad media and the satellite.

We support We will actively participate in this work. The traditional and non-example construction and trust measures will play a role in replenishing, but cannot replace the legal documents. This group will take the necessary measures to assess the relevant space activities. We believe that any new outer space international framework will... in an operationally stable and safe environment that is maintained for peaceful purposes in the interest of all countries.

Turkey values the right to enter and use the outer space with a peaceful purpose without restrictions. We welcome the establishment of this group. 通过规范 the space. We have passed the space project, which is to protect the satellite from the moon's and test the anti-satellite system, and increase the threat to the outer space. The anti-satellite system causes fragments, threatens, and peace, and uses the outer space. And with this spirit, we welcome the recent US life of the author, which is not to engage in anti-satellite activities. which is after signing the Outer Air Treaty 53 years, we can see that this is the time of the outer air activity. In addition, this agreement prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons, large-scale kill weapons deployed on the track or to deploy space objects. and the new staff's interference, network attacks, and the microwave and other situations. We should be cautious. We must be vigilant. to prevent the air and air war. This is a good step to better understand these issues and reduce the threat of air and air.

We hope that Turkey will give us the following suggestions. should be implemented. And there are some channels to avoid misunderstandings.

I assure you that we will fully support and complete this work. Algeria also agrees to... The threat of peace and security in the world is also a threat to our daily lives. This is a social impact. We must take responsibility for the military competition. to destroy and achieve our common goal. We must maintain the outer space to avoid the deployment of large-scale killing weapons or other weapons so that others can benefit. The need for more and more transparent and higher trust measures is becoming more and more necessary. For this reason, countries with important airspace means should have special responsibilities to actively promote peace and use airspace. And we must avoid airspace arms competition, to counter international principles and rules. We must promote international cooperation and peace. Obviously, space, and space are all common human wealth. We must explore them together, and we must work together. This is in line with the interests of all human beings. We must promote the full cooperation of the space and space, and strengthen the construction capacity. This is what we are doing in developing countries. Algeria fully supports the efforts to strengthen the law. foreign policy and joint efforts to build a common future for mankind. Its purpose is to prevent the threat of international peace and security. We believe that the forum is the only place where the financial negotiations can play a key role. and should be negotiated immediately, which is the issue related to the process, which is to prevent the air-to-air military competition. We are committed to avoiding such a military competition, especially in the talks. We also support the various decisions made by the United Nations. I would like to thank the reporters and thank them for their introduction this morning, which is to introduce the introduction of international regulations, rules, and principles, This discussion is very important, which is the decision to implement No. 73231. Because it can guide our work. The current issues related to the safety of the airspace, the exchanges between the two countries, and the documents of the more precious can enable us to create a comprehensive legal and standard list so that we can strengthen our mutual understanding so that we can achieve important conclusions together. This is a sign of our responsibility. We must prevent the foreign military competition, which is to establish and strengthen the existing laws and regulations. At the same time, we must be sincere and strengthen the system based on the interests of all countries. In this case, we should explore common points and complement each other, and involve different practices. We should consider the practicality of the existing legal framework and whether it is necessary to meet the new challenges. In order to determine the legal framework and fill the blanks, we should work together. through the constant negotiation, negotiation of new rules with legal obligations, and through some new transparent and credible measures. We will use the spirit of the treaty to organize activities in different countries, to conduct exploration and to use the outer space, including the moon and other planets.

S1M218,1,2,China,"Yes. Thank you, Chairman. I hope I can tell you something. But it's not yet. I think this afternoon, I think we will get the situation at this time. So we must emphasize that we must have such a list as soon as possible. Because it is different from the first discussion, it is difficult. I demand a speech, which is to continue this very meaningful discussion. It is the first issue of the Guoba delegation. About this first topic, there are other topics. We think it is necessary to focus on of foreign countries. Today, there are indeed some private companies who use the outside world to conduct activities and more than half of the countries in the United Nations are engaged in activities. Therefore, our discussion is limited to the actions of the country. has shown that we have given up many things. We also understand that if the country shows its responsible behavior, if it fulfills its new obligations, it can make these countries able to demand that all space activists follow international law. This will be meaningful. But we are worried. And there are indeed some threats. And we should have higher ideals to deal with these threats. So from the perspective of Cuba, the existing legal framework, which is about the first step, sets some standards. These standards are not related to non-national departments. We should consider these factors. Our objective responsibility is related to the country. They launch objects into space. This activity may be carried out by private companies. And I don't think there are any regulations or regulations in the international law. which is... which involves irresponsible behavior, which is the behavior of private companies, not the behavior of the state. I am sorry for the interruption. I was not present when you introduced me, but I am very happy to have a very good document. I originally wanted to review this document. This document has fully introduced the existing international law. This document also includes some content that the international law does not agree with. But the last point I would like to draw your attention to is today's discussion. I think we should now move to the next stage. I think there is a problem, which is the principle of peace and space. I am very grateful. The university of the same name has made a brief introduction to this issue. They believe that peace is not about using the outside world. It should be non-aggressive. But I don't think so. Peace is about using the outside world. According to our thoughts and according to the existing practices, it has automatically eliminated military actions. And this is not related to the 51th There are many international regulations and military actions that are clearly excluded. We do not think that if weapons are deployed on the track to self-defense, we do not think that this is a peaceful external control. Because we cannot guarantee that this weapon is only used for self-defense. This may be an offensive weapon. This issue should be discussed here. Why am I talking about this? I know the explanation is different. But we should have a consensus so that we can work in one direction or another. If our explanation is to use the outer space in peace, then we can automatically rule out military actions. Can we? a political statement is enough for us to make a common explanation. But if we use a restrictive measure, such as the use of peace outside the country, only to involve non-violence, then we must also admit that there is a big blank in this law.",2

We will come together with all the representatives to support your work. We look forward to your hard work, and we will do our best to support your work. to prevent the air and air defense competition. to maintain the safety of the air. Mr. Chu, I listened carefully to the speech of several experts and colleagues this morning. My feeling is that since the international space activities... to maintain the peace of the world. Over the past decades, international negotiations have reached a series of international legal documents based on the Overseas Treaty. The international law and international rules have established a peaceful use of space to prevent the air and space war. to prevent the military and anti-aircraft weapons competition. To maintain the safety of the air, we have built a basic framework. for peace exploration and other space. and to prevent the development of military competitions around large-scale kill-and-run weapons. and promote global strategic stability. while also providing effective and effective legal documents such as the Confirmed Outland Treaty. We also need to see that these terms do not prohibit the entry of non-large-scale mass-damaged weapons into outer space. and cannot completely avoid using or threatening outer objects. to prevent the existence of external weapons. due to the limitations of historical conditions and the development of space technology. The existing international air law system is difficult to meet the long-term and real needs of maintaining air safety. In this context, we must maintain air safety and achieve peace and stability. at least take two-way measures. The first is a series of international legal documents that fully implement the UN Constitution and the international treaty. 各国有义 and the UN Charter and the spirit of the Overseas Air Treaty to develop their own air policy. especially the defense policy. We must stick to the bottom line of no conflict in the space. Sorry, it's the bottom line of the armed conflict that we stick to not happening in the outer space. Second, through full communication, discussion and negotiation. and the rich external air-controlling legal system. Only the law-controlling documents with the legal requirements are made. 真正致力于外空飞武器化。 to completely eliminate the possibility of the air defense competition. to contribute to the international progress of the International Space Challenge. China believes that the above two paths should be promoted, and followed by the following four principles. The first is based on the international law. I agree with what the colleague from Algeria just said. For the current lack and emptiness of the law of the outer space, we should... should be supplemented and improved by the way of negotiating the legal documents. Second, we need to deal with the problem of air safety in a comprehensive way. The safety of the outer space is complex and complex. We must conduct comprehensive tests to ensure long-term safety. Third, two routes and two measures must be used to prevent air-to-air competition and air-to-air weapons. The safety of the air must be protected from the potential of the air-to-air weaponization and military competition. Without this potential, the air will never be clear. The fourth is to maintain the stability of the outer space strategy. Any measures to protect the airspace should be helpful to enhance the public safety of all countries. rather than forming a single-sided strategic advantage. We look forward to discussing with you and our and through the comprehensive and international law. 反对外空武器化。 to maintain the stable outer space. Mr. Chairman, we cannot win the air-to-air war. or like what a IG colleague said No one won the space race. China wants to continue to work together to maintain the common safety of all mankind. to actively explore effective legal ways to deal with the threat of airspace. to contribute actively to the peace and security of the airspace. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. is the most pragmatic. This includes the responsibility of the company to promote technology through policy and implement it in the international law, especially in the scientific and industrial sectors. Portugal has approved the two 10-year foreign policy, and it was all done based on this view. First, our Foreign Policy 2030. We will create new foreign law that will lend us the experience of other countries. These strategies have been approved by the government. They will move all departments of society. They are public property. They will promote the new opportunities for institutions, industries and international cooperation. They will also promote the development of innovation and competitive technology in the international market. The second strategy is the air defense strategy 2020-2030. Because the twin-frame map is a hot spot in the morning, I want to point out that even the armed forces have examples that are not only used for air defense, for example, including air technology and satellite technology. Our military delegation has expanded its scope to respond to complex economic issues including natural disasters and other disasters, and recently the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dual-task map includes the use and use of military and security forces, which should also be reflected in our discussion. Mr. Xu, the national measures is to provide all countries, regardless of their participation in the activities. The technology of the air and the air industry are rapidly developing. It needs to be followed by international policies, laws and regulations. For example, our air ecosystem... In the past year, the recovery was up to 120%. The total number of people, 1,400 people, including 300 high-level engineers. They directly used space technology. The cost of use between 2006 and 2015 is $89 million. The democratization of the outer space means that everyone has a space for their own benefits. Some of them are definitely useful for everyone. I thank the representative of the POTA for her speech. Now... I am French, French-speaking. Thank you.",4
S1M222,1,2,French,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, we congratulate you on your discussion today. Let's reach consensus. As the representative of the second session, we have agreed to discuss the issue. This is related to the issue of the current international law. 特别是... 1967 We remember that the U.S. representative on the 67th Pact, the principle of logic and the principle of judicial jurisdiction, the country must monitor the activities of private companies. The sixth Pact of the 67th Pact is clearly stated here. It clarifies how the country monitors the activities of private companies for a peaceful purpose. but it has never been prohibited to use it in military activities. In the previous speech, we heard the Chinese representative say this opinion. This is a few months ago, and there are still 67 years of provisions for use in objects. Today we are looking at the UN Charter also for use. This is a ban on using or threatening to use force against the principle of outer space objects. This is also used in outer space. Thank you.",2
S1M224,1,2,Germany,"Thank you, Chairman. We believe that the International Law is important to the challenge of airspace safety. Today's discussion, today's experts have confirmed this. We confirm that the International Law is used for airspace. We support the promotion of the addition of relevant documents, systems and指南. I see three points through the discussion. These three points are worth considering and discussing in the group. This involves the use of space in the International Law. First point. 关于外空这一点所有的专家 We all talk about considering the international law for this specific situation. This is a natural point. Legal experts naturally consider this point. I have never had the opportunity to put legal and technical experts together. In our opinion, it will be very helpful to do both sides together. The operation of the second technology is now combined with the combination of two technologies. So these are not reflected in the legal framework. This is because of technological development. These will draw the attention of legal experts, so that we can discuss them in the context of knowledge. So in our opinion, Through observation, we have concluded that promoting communication is already a part of promoting responsible foreign affairs. The second point I want to talk about is the use of peace. We discussed a lot about this at the next meeting. But we think it's necessary to analyze further. in the Fali literature. 为和平目 可是如果 谈到…… to maintain international peace and security. But if we look at the fourth one... The idea here involves the instrument and other celestial objects. The 外空发生 比方说就后者,微信通讯。 This is a military activity. In many cases, satellite communications are brought by the satellite system. At least according to our understanding, this itself does not bring security threats. So we feel that... I'm starting to analyze which military contracts exist. It's a very interesting thing. In our opinion... These activities are very helpful in increasing transparency. This helps us to distinguish what is wrong and what is not. This can lead us to use the space more peacefully. The last point is the issue of responsible behavior and international law. We will talk later. 向提醒关注一点。 迈空条约。 There are two former officials. This resolution brings the air to the moon. Another point, Experts also mentioned it. There is no voluntary measure to prepare for legal documents. We think this is an interesting idea. Considering the work here, mainly to apply for legal documents. Some elements may not bring this result. I think what is interesting is what Professor Aoki mentioned. will make responsible behavior reach a new standard. I would like to ask everyone to further analyze this idea. First, how do we assess responsible behavior? Strengthen the existing international legal documents, and improve the foundation for the implementation of these documents.",2
S1M226,1,2,United Kingdom,"Thank you, everyone. I would like to talk about some of the opinions of the experts and the public. Tonight, we will think about it. Of course, we will not spend the whole night thinking about it. As the decision-making body, we hope to achieve success. I hope to promote responsible behavior and communication. This is our United Nations Kingdom. We had a very good meeting two weeks ago. We got it. I am very happy to share the document with you. The other document is also available on the Internet. But it is always good to get the paper version.",2
S1M228,1,2,Sri Lanka,"Thank you, Chairman. Congratulations on being the chairman of the DG Council. Thank you for sharing your views with us. We will support you to push forward this process and achieve realistic results. We also praise the speech of experts today that inspired people. Before we talk about tomorrow's topic 5, general opinion exchange, I will now talk about topic 6A. Since the establishment of the satellite in 1957, the rapid development of the use of space and the conquest of space are what those countries with and without capabilities want. The Outer Space Treaty is the foundation of the Outer Space Act. It states that humans have a common wish to explore and use outer space for peace. It's third clause. The basic principles of exploration and the basic principles of using space, including satellites and other celestial bodies, must be in accordance with the international law, including the UN Charter. From the perspective of the financial situation, the foreign policy includes some legal gaps. Therefore, the foreign military and the US military have never been prohibited. Some of the legal gaps in the foreign policy include limited prohibition of nuclear weapons and large-scale nuclear weapons. The deployment of weapons on the earth's track and the use of the flag for peace. This involves the moon and other planets, but not the entire outer space. The outer space treaty, like Article 10 and 12, they are not enough. In fact, when this treaty was passed, we were deeply disappointed that there was no ban on military activities according to the treaty. So, as the technology of the outer space is rapidly developing, the existing legal system does not follow the actual situation. So, to prevent the spread of the outer space, since the first special financial meeting in 1978, it has been on the agenda. It has confirmed that it needs to further prevent the spread of the outer space. In addition, many representatives, including the national representative, pointed out that it is necessary to re-research the registration contract. The registration contract indicates that it is necessary to confirm the authorization to register the object that is entered into the air not only to identify but also to help the international law to implement the use of exploration and space. The registration system can increase transparency, increase capacity and counter capability. But it only requires providing its intelligence. This is not helpful in meeting the transparency requirements. The further expansion of the public contract goal will ensure the use of the outer space in a peaceful manner. This is helpful in achieving the purpose of the public contract. In my opinion, The existing legal system for space activities needs to be further strengthened. We need to consider the current situation and the development of the space field. Confirming fundamental principles is important in the regulatory system. The fundamental principles include the obligation of the state to abide by the international law, including the UN Charter, The leader of the country has the right to have space and physical objects. It recognizes the common interests of human beings in exploration and uses space for peace. Each country has the right to have freedom to explore space and other physical objects. The country is also responsible for the damage caused by the private and private entities. According to the international law and international regulations, we must emphasize once again that we must consider that more non-national entities actively participate in foreign trade activities and rapidly commercialize foreign trade. This is to consider the interest of the business. Mr. Xu, we will resume at the end. consider the need for the development of airspace competition and security, and consider the need to continue to use airspace for the development of human beings. So, it is not possible to negotiate a rule to prevent the spread of airspace equipment. Thank you.",4
S1M230,1,2,Cuba,"Thank you, Chairman. I think I want to... I hope that now I can make a simple speech. I want to respond to the American representatives and the French representatives. I think we have been interacting and talking for a whole week. We have already heard... the current standards. But we should also consider the responsibility of the country, which involves non-governmental behavior. But some people know the situation in the United States, which is that the damage caused by cross-border conflict will require another country to take responsibility. In this case, This responsibility is for another country to accept. But in other circumstances, this obligation is not always accepted. So I suggest... We are going to discuss the sixth part of the program. I want to know if everyone agrees with this point, because under this circumstance, there is no need to discuss the third party's responsibility. Because when it is just a damage, the responsible country should automatically admit it. If that's the case, that's very good. We think this is appropriate, and our documents also cover this point. I think... I think if there is a document in this regard, it is a real progress. If everyone agrees, the last point I want to talk about is that we can talk about peace activities all week. Of course, we are not talking about the prohibition of military activities. If it is about this, the military can participate in the rescue activities in the civilian areas. But I would like to explain how it can be considered as a peace and peace use of the air when deploying weapons in the air. If we deploy a weapon, we can use it, otherwise we will not deploy it. So if we deploy a weapon in the air, then how can we think that... This is a peaceful foreign policy. This will create a division of international law, which is how the case will react, which is to violate international law in this case, and how we should determine the background of foreign policy. We are in the United Nations. has been discussed seven times, and it has been said that it would harm international peace and security. We have a standard that is also applicable to the Earth. Here, we believe that international peace and security can be harmed. So we can think that it is a peaceful use of foreign forces to deploy weapons in outer space. Please forgive me if I speak longer than expected. Thank you, Cuba. The hair is relatively short. Not bad. Now, please.",2
S1M231,1,2,Russia,"What is... 要求答辩 Thank you. Some speeches, some representatives, their views on the Russian satellite, we have to bring up the first material. Our experiment is based on the principles of international law. Our country has not violated any obligations in the experiment. This is the angle of strengthening our national self-defence capabilities. from the sweet cat. to prevent any harm to other countries' space objects, especially to the International Space Station. We have explained the reasons for this experiment many times. I would like to ask you to understand the statement of the Ministry of Defense. Thank you.",2
S1M32,1,3,China,"Yeah, thank you. So I'm very happy to share my personal and academic views about the applicability of the law of use of force as just assigned by our organizer. So I just, the short title of my presentation is about the sensitiveness of, and the challenges to define the armed attack in space. So as we know, it is a very sensitive and stressful topic, not only to me, but to all of us. So first I would like to talk about the sensitiveness of this topic, and then followed by to recognize the challenges to us, to define the attack in space. And then I would try to provide a theory as a solution, possible solution. in this regard, and with a remark. So as to the system is to define the tech in space.",2
S1M34,1,3,China,"As far as I'm concerned, all states should be very cautious to discuss the applicability of the law of use of force to avoid misusing the right of to open the commining door to use of force. The prohibition of use of force in space should be expressly reflected or contained in treaties, just like what has been done by the PPWT. And besides, all the states should be aware that Paris is the first defensive line for preserving space security, which is critical to prevent or avoid the use of force in space. It might be not necessary to discuss or apply self-defense if international community could achieve consensus on a comprehensive, effective Paris framework or treaty. And on the contrary, the occurring of the use of force in space in future would indicate that we need a more effective and practical Paris treaty. Meanwhile, states should realize that identifying the applicability of existing international law, or we say, lax lata, is crucial to ensuring space security. Common recognition of lax lata and the acknowledgment of each other's legal position is important for preventing misunderstanding, misperception, misjudgment, and the conflict or its escalation in space. Likewise, states are encouraged to recognize the applicability of laxata step by step. It is more important and less sensitive or risky to discuss on the applicability of international space law, the law of international telecommunication, the law of state's responsibility in the space security scenarios. And it might be a bit earlier for all states to formally discuss the applicability of the law use force at this stage when the Paris process is still in somehow deadlock. Therefore, the practical methodology for the process of space security, international governance should be a stepwise one. First, just focus on Paris, seek for comprehensive legally binding document based on common recognition of the applicability of international space law, the law of international telecommunication, the law of state's responsibility. And second, just based on these common understandings to foster a benign atmosphere to establish mutual trusts among stakeholders and then to evaluate whether it would be necessary and feasible to discuss sensitive matters like the applicability of the law of use of force and HL in space. So just bearing all these concerns in mind, I'd like to introduce my academic views about the applicability of the law of use of force. in space, in particularly the threshold of armed attack in space. So we have to resort to the traditional theory about armed attack, of course. And then I just found that there's so many challenges with respect to determining armed attack in space. So it has inherent connection with user force, I mean armed attack, and is deemed as the most great forms of the user force. Only when user force reaches to certain threshold, it would amount to under attack. And I noticed that the United States in its official document in the law of war manual, argued that the inherent right of self-defense potentially apply against any illegal use of force. So it has to be discussed among us, of course. And according to the traditional views, The constitutive elements of armed attack always includes two parts, subjective intention and grave consequences or gravity. We know that the UN Charter Foundation focus on prohibition of physical armed force closely corresponds with many modern counter space weapons systems that rely on kinetic energy to deliver significant mass to destroy targets. However, is challenging to apply traditional views in space scenarios. First, it is tough to judge subjective status. First, when the satellite approaches another satellite and generate electromagnetic interference, it is difficult to judge whether it is deliberate or not. Second, the dual-use nature of space objects brings challenges to determine whether their actions are military in nature. First is in event, as we know that starting satellites approached the China space station, it is speculated by someone that the approaches might have a military or security purpose. Third, the existence of the soft killing means like electronic, electromagnetic, cyber interference, the use of direct energy, and cooperate operations like the ADR, make it controversial that whether the occurrence of human deaths, property damage, are still the only standard to determine gravity. And now I would like to analyze such kind of challenges in more specific scenarios. So the hypothetical case one, if state A uses a ground-based or space-based kinetic energy weapons, to intersect or destroy the satellite of state B, it might be defined as an armed attack with least objections. And case two, the directing energy weapons used by state A, such as laser illumination, that result in the destruction of state B satellite or its component parts, might be defined as armed attack with less objections, but the precondition is that it can be proved that state A is deliberate to do so. Case three, state A uses side-blamings to hack into the satellite system of state B and cause damage to the system. It might be defined as armed attack, depending on whether the damage satisfies the threshold of gravity. If state A manipulates the control of satellites of others, whether it constitutes armed attack is uncertain. And it might be defined as such since it might be more harmful. And case four, if the use of electromagnetic or sebumin-specific A to interfere with state space TDMC telemetry track and command system result in a long failure, it could be defined as armed attack. However, it is also necessary to consider whether state A can foresee the outcome. The more foreseeable it is, the more likely it is to be defined as armed attack. And in case five, state A's use of core rate technology, such as ADR technology, to damage or capture state B satellite might be defined as armed attack. At least state A has evidence to show it is just an accident or based on reasonable reasons. It would be more complicated if state A, in actively removing state B satellite, causes exploring that destroys the sea's satellite. It is unclear whether state's action constituted an armed attack against the sea. As they see, we need to prove that state's action were intentional. And case six, state A's use of electromagnetic means to interfere with state space PNT or communication systems might not be defined as armed attack. However, if it results in serious consequences such as a civil aviation crash, and it can be shown whether state A could have foreseen the consequences. It may be defined as armed attack. In general, state A's use of laser to dazzle state B's espionage satellite might not be defined as armed attack considering it is a technical quantum espionage matter and does not generate serious consequences. Meanwhile, it does not cause damage to the satellite per se. Nevertheless, if damages occur, it is necessary to prove that state A acted on purpose. Otherwise, it may not be defined as an armed attack. Case A, the acts of state's A satellites operating maneuvers and proximity operation, RPO against the state's B satellite should not be constituted armed attack in general. And case nine, in the case of an asset test conducted by state A, which generates debris that damages or destroys state space satellite, whether it constitutes an armed attack remain an unsettled issue, whereas it might not might be defined as armed attack if it can be proven that state A deliberately they serve, just with the intention of destroying state space satellite through the test. In addition, it requires a proximity between the result and act. Case 10. A more complicated situation is that above acts are carried out by a private entity on the jurisdiction of state A against a private entity on the jurisdiction of state B. And it is more difficult to define whether it is an armed attack taken by state A against state B. Generally speaking, the closer the connection between the conduct of state A's company and state A's government, the greater the likelihood it would be defined as armed attack. For instance, it might be a military option just under the control or directed by state A. Meanwhile, it is also necessary that the sale of state B's company is vital to military or other significant of state be otherwise it could be deemed as it might be deemed as international tort rather than the ambit of the law of the force. So now I just tried to bring a new theory to define the threshold. It's just the academic views, of course, the theory of overall threshold to define the armed attack. Firstly, this theory adopts the combination of subjective and objective standards in traditional views, which means a space behavior constituting armed attack must both satisfy requirements of the subjective elements and objective consequences. And now is the difficult part, just assuming that the gravity threshold indicator for determining armed attack is 10, So I'm trying to say that from one to 10, it just represents the different level of the connections between the subjective objective elements at hand to be examined and the threshold of armed attack. So number one, just the represents, it can hardly reach the threshold. And the number nine means it's very close to the threshold. So in case one, If the indicator of the subjective animus is assessed at 5 and objective consequences reach 5, 2, it's just a average, it can be identified as under attack as a whole. And in case 2, suppose that the subjective animus is unclear or is lice malicious. Such behavior, sorry, first instance, it is estimated as 3. But objective consequences caused by such behavior can be evaluated as seven due to its gravity. It is supposed to be a serious consequences. Then the space behavior can still be defined as armed attack. In case three, imagine that the gravity indicator is three. There's no, you know, like serious consequences. But it is still possible to be defined as armed attack when the space behavior is guided by obvious malicious intention, supposing that this subjective indicator can be valued at a seven. And so, of course, such kind of hypothetical analysis or we say the theory. It just does to show the basic logic. of this proposed theory of overall threshold. In light of particularity of the space environment is vulnerable and the complexity and the convertiveness of space conflict, a case-by-case methodology should be adopted to define the armed attack in space. So to better understand above theory, here are some basic principles to be considered by all of you. So the first one. Perspective of from perspective of intention, the degree of space X and animals is a direct rational to the likelihood of being determined as on the tech, the more obvious the malicious intentions, the more likely it is to be defined as on the tech there from the perspective of action, the higher of the intense intensity and the safety of a space behavior, the more likely it is to be defined as armed attack. From the perspective of consequences, the more harmful a space behavior is, the more likely it is to be defined as armed attack. The harmful consequences not only refer to the interference disrupt, this great damage or distraction against space objects or space activities, but also included the damage caused to the relevant military interests. and other major interests of the attacked state. Consequences can be considered from a large ambit, from seriousness, immediacy, directness, military interests, state's involvement, memorable degree, and the profitability of action party, et cetera. And for other elements, perspectives, In addition to the above subjective animus and consequences, the scale and deterrence of the space behavior or closely related to determine the attack. So the bigger the scale, the stronger the deterrence, the more likely it might be defined as armed attack. So as a conclusion, we can see the is a very complicated situation to define self-defense. to define the armed attack actually it's also about the use of force in outer space. I have to say determining armed attack is inevitably associated with the definition of space weapon. We know it is very challenging to find a clear definition of space weapon. The definition of space weapon as to me it might not be necessarily precondition to determine armed attack in space. Once a space behavior is defined as armed attack or user force based on a buff theory, then the space object or the payload only used in this attack or user force could be deemed as a space weapon subsequently. The common recognition of the applicability of Laxlata is the precondition to determining whether a space behavior is responsible or irresponsible. Without legal certainties, which means whether a space behavior is legal or not, is still not clear. It's really hard to judge this behavior as responsible or irresponsible. Last but not least, It should be kept in mind that space war must never be fought. Besides, it should be clearly noted that the prohibition of the use of force is a fundamental, crucial guarantee for the preserving space security. The use of force in space is taboo, and it requires that all countries, especially space when they make their space strategic plans, national defense policies, and the care on military development and activities. I stop there. Thank you.",0
S1M36,1,3,Russia,"Let me introduce myself. I'm Andrei Malo, Associate Professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Federation. A retired diplomat used to work in Geneva, mission of the Russian Federation for many years. So it's a very topic we're talking and discussing now. Speaking on examples of acts against space systems that would violate the duty of a state. to refrain in its international relations with the threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Let me start with some general observations. Let me first start with a question. Is there any reason today to talk about the existence of preconditions? for the placement of weapons in outer space? To my estimates, the answer is rather yes than no. There are international legal gaps that allow for the placement of weapons in outer space, as well as the relevance military and strategic prerequisites and as may be assumed scientific and technological capacities. That is to say the prospects of the gradual transformation. of outer space into an arena of armed confrontation and a potential theater war is not groundless. Warponization of space could potentially lead to a new division of the world for those who possessed it or potentially could possess capable space military assets, including those of attack ones and those countries which simply cannot afford it, making the whole political world picture. similar to the division between nuclear and non-nuclear states. To understand the challenges all of us face and to find means to address them, it is important to clearly distinguish the threats posed to humanity by the arms race in outer space, accompanied by the weaponization of outer space. On the one hand, from the risks and dangers associated with the objective development of space activities, the involvements of new actors on them and the impact of natural phenomenon on the other. They differ in their origins, that is to say the factors contributing to their emergence. In case of a threat of an armed race in other space, such factor is the intention or aspiration of a single state or a group of states to gain a military advantage over its potential adversaries. Take a dominant position. in outer space as well as to be able to impose its national policies on other states as the autumn pattern of behavior in outer space. In other words, and it's very important for the matter we're talking about, the source of the problem is the political will and the state policy. In contrast, the dangers and risks of space activities derived from the natural resources of their developments. the increasing density of space traffic and space operations, space debris and effects of natural phenomena such as space weather. Here we face the already existing problems. Rules of the game and norms are quite realistic in this area. With the exclusion of the direct and strong prohibition of the placement of nuclear weapons. and any other weapons of mass destruction in outer space. These existing legal norms and legal restrictions do not prohibit the placement of other weapons systems, as we all know. There are no prohibitive international legal norms with regards to a number of possible areas of space activities related to space track weapons and anti-satellite systems, as well as electronic and optoelectronics oppression. And this is very important. When we speak on certain acts on space systems, it's better to clearly realize what kind of acts and what systems we're talking about. The situation here is becoming more complicated by the appearance of new technological breakthroughs, the process of miniaturization of satellites, the use of them in swarms, the new possibilities. to secretly impose your will on hostile satellites, new forms of kinetic and passive non-kinetic influence on space platforms. In other words, the qualitatively new possibilities of hidden and prompt anti-satellite potential coupled with increasing abeam space potential and new innovations targeted against hypersonic weapons of different... Among the lightest ones and very confusing, the launches of the so-called advanced extremely high frequency communication supplies. I stress that communication supplies. In the interests of the program, integrated war fighting solutions beyond active defense aimed at the adaptation of the developing global ABN system for passive and hidden prevention. of the LIME IBM launches. This would have a profound negative influence on strategic stability. Could we consider it as an act of violation? This is a good question. After the collapse of the ABM treaty in 2002, the commitment not to develop, test, or place space-based ABM systems and their components ceased to exist. This not only paved the way for the development of space weapons for missile defense, but also made it possible to develop space-based anti-satellite weapons programs, owing to the availability of relevant and similar technologies. At the same time, some countries argue that the use of space for weapons placements is in the response to new threats posed by the chloroferration weapons of mass destruction, missile and missile technologies, including hypersonic, and the acquisition by a number of states of means to interfere. with the operation of space systems, in particular the technology to blind spacecraft cells with laser radiation. The list of innovations could be continued. I am giving this innovation chance because they directly affect the situation when we speak on acts of violation. In a greater number of cases. they simply cannot be properly detected and defined and taken out from the general strategic context. We could assume that there is a great deal of innovative research in this field in the key space pairing nations. The key problem with technical innovations also derives from the fact that it is becoming more and more difficult to differentiate between the so-called CQ5 systems. command control, communication, and intelligence. Systems working for the strategic stability and new space attack systems with hidden potential of influence. These CQPY assets, space assets, by the nature of their tests, where and are considered not to be destabilizing, whereas, and therefore, non-dangerous for maintaining strategic balance of forces. More than that, they deliberately the interest of strategic stability and strategic balance. The early warning systems against the IBM attacks would definitely be added to this stability list. The key point here, any attack on this system would lead to uncontrollable escalation of conflict, including nuclear war. And definitely is the violation of a duty of a state as a responsible state. Thus, the assets in space are becoming more and more interchangeable, interconnected, and integrated, which, as a consequence, would make the eventual diplomatic work on the scope of application of potential legal international instruments, or legal norms, or of any kind, in this field more and more difficult. More than that. these new mixed and hidden possibilities of space assets in reality would create new forms of causes belly. And as a consequence, widen the potential areas of violations. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much.",0
S1M38,1,3,United States,"Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for your presentations that will help us in our debates in this room. And I would like to ask if it is possible to give presentations to delegations so that they can study them in a more in-depth way, as we already asked yesterday. I would like to make a few comments first and then ask some questions to Professor Wang. Go you. Hello, she can't be a question professor Malo. This is a legacy. Activity is a unit on the a extra most very is a very a possibility to pose a question so point. It we for the professor go you she would have a sure good starling is a conjunction a with the space was not at all military end and I would like to say that we are recording and following very close activities of the ONG, of Starlink. So I have two questions at the attention of the professor. First, is international law prohibited as a force use the test of a site And secondly, if the country's army has deployed a laser capable of fighting against satellites, if it uses this system against the satellite of another country, can it be considered as a force resource? Thank you. I will then ask... Thank you for the floor.",3
S1M39,1,3,China,"It was based on an approach that we had retained last year. I am not a technician, but what was said to me was that... It is part of the normal operation of the two satellites that approach the Chinese space station. But I am open, I cannot give an answer assured. As for the questions, the first question. We all know that the recourse to force... and I would say, prohibited. And the chart says that all member states will refrain from doing this. But as you said, this story of tests or trials. We know that such a weapon is not explicitly prohibited in international law. It's a party. Meh. I would like to say that it is very complicated. Everything that is not forbidden is not necessarily allowed. We need to understand the legal or political point of view. It is not always necessary to have a treaty of prohibition on what is not explicitly prohibited in international law. I think that the essence of international law is that it develops... in the process of searching for strategic balance between the powers and all the stakeholders. We must take the problem as a whole, and it is not a particular point or concern. We must take all the security of Spain, the governance of the security of Spain as a whole. And the first thing to do is to recognize a threat that concerns everyone. So the test is actually a risk, but not all tests. As for the second question. I actually talked about it a little bit in my script. If it is for example an illumination, if it is a blind laser based in space or on the ground, if the objective is clear and that it is... It could be considered as a technical countermeasure to protect legitimate security law. So it is not explicitly prohibited in international law, especially in the international law of space. But if the objective is not a countermeasure, so if it is a behavior that we could call irresponsible, if, for example, the laser targets a civilian or commercial satellite, non-military, which clearly shows that it is not military. This could be an obstacle to the relevant articles of the treaty on the space and extra-atmospheric. But once again, the precondition. To be able to analyze, it is that a laser blinded, stationed on the ground, must be considered as an activity in space, because Article 9 applies only to... And so we have to define that as an action in space.",2
S1M311,1,3,China,"Thank you, President. I like French. I don't have an interpreter here, says Professor Wang. This probably means that the interpretation is not in the system. So Professor Wang asks the French ambassador to say again what the question and comment was from the French ambassador. I heard TCBM, I understood that. It seems there are... Can I request... Thank you Mr. President, but honestly I don't know how I can change the channel. I use the Zoom application, but I don't really know how to change the channel. OK, OK. Yeah, I found it. Yes, I found it. Yeah, it's my fault. Yes, I'm the one responsible. I found it. President. Would I be rude if I asked the French ambassador to ask his question in French? Thank you, Mr. President.",3
S1M312,1,3,President,"First of all, I would like to apologize to Professor Wang for not being able to speak Chinese. I would have liked to do so, but that is not the case. I will briefly repeat my comments. The first comment I addressed to Professor Wang was that he talked about armed aggression, but we believe that there is a whole set of unamicable behaviors that exist under the contributes to international tensions and that they can be escalating. And we have to set up standards to deal with these unamical behaviors. And the question I asked Professor Wang was to know if it was possible, when it comes to armed aggression in space, to prove that such an action is intentional or deliberate, or that it is not. To make a distinction between what is intentional or what is not, and how can we set up means to prove this distinction. And does Professor Wang think that the implementation of TCBM measures such as notifications could help to make this distinction between what is deliberate and what is not, what is an armed assault and what is not. I thank Professor Wang for his possible answer. I thank the distinguished... I thank the French ambassador for his patience and for repeating his question. I think things are clearer now for all of us, since we have now heard him twice. I now turn to Professor Wang. I hope that this time he will have access to interpretation.",3
S1M313,1,3,China,"Thank you, Mr. President. I also thank the French ambassador for wanting to repeat his question. Tout d'abord. You mentioned the fact that all activities in space are not necessarily aggressions, that there is a threshold. I don't know if we can take into account all the activities that take place. I don't know if it's possible to integrate them into a treaty that would specify the ban on such or such activity. I don't know if it's necessary, the situation seems uncertain to me. We could look at the situation in case by case. I think of the decision that was made by the United States concerning the... Test antisatellite. The question of precise liberation also arises. Should we talk about prohibition? Should we talk about abstaining from having such or such behavior? This is a subject that must be discussed in depth by the Member States. It is also necessary that a political will exist to discuss these subjects before we can think of an instrument that would be legally constraining. Second point, indeed you are right, it is very difficult to judge the subjective state. in which there is a state, especially in space activities. The measures of transparency and confidence that you have mentioned are always useful in these situations, but they are not sufficient. You talked about the immatriculation, in particular mandatory notifications, this type of mechanism. plays a very important role in space activities, normal, in quotes. But I don't know if... A state would be ready to provide information about military measures or security measures taken in space. These are the measures to make this trust transparent. We are at a preliminary stage, I would say. Verification mechanisms can have a role to play. But here too, as I said in my presentation... It may be too early to talk about verification measures in space at the moment. I hope that all Member States will be ready to implement transparency measures, this confidence, will be ready to create this mutual confidence. by recognizing the existence of threats in space and by seeking to find solutions that will allow us to prevent these threats from persisting. But I don't know if the time is right to discuss more detailed mechanisms. We are not there yet, I think. Thank you.",2
S1M314,1,3,United Kingdom,"I thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I would like to thank Professor Wang and Dr. Maloff for their excellent presentations. They are in the right line of the round table of IER, excellent quality. I would like to underline it. My delegation particularly appreciates the level of these presentations. I was marked by several of the elements that have been presented. I will come back to some of them. I will also have some questions to ask. First of all, in the presentation of Professor Wang. I was marked by the 10 scenarios that he presented, which seems very useful to me. This allows us to better understand this problem. Some of the actions that seem quite clear have been presented. They would be covered by the existing legal framework, especially the use of force. Then, while the different cases have been presented, we have seen gray areas, a certain ambiguity, being born with the questions that came to the verification in particular. I really liked what Professor Wang said about a approach that would focus on behavior and that would leave the means in the background. It seemed to me to be something useful. The question I would have asked is the following. We talked about a threshold between the existing legal framework, maybe the measures of transparency and confidence on which the Ambassador of France came back. Does it exist in this gray zone? a possibility to define these terms in the case of a legally constraining instrument. So it's difficult at the moment, but we see that certain behaviors, certain actions are clearly identified as dangerous or destabilizing by all of us. So I would like to know what you think of the role of political commitment in relation to this question of the definition of the threshold. Second question. These two presentations have focused on the use of force or armed attack. I would like to know what Professor Wang's opinion is on the threat of using force. We haven't talked about it. How do we evaluate the immediate nature of an attack or threat of an attack? How do we evaluate the intention in a phase of pre-use of force, if you allow me to qualify it that way? Last question. The application of the new article of the Space Treaty to other activities. I think we can draw the conclusion from these two presentations that there are activities that have to do with the space system that do not take place in space. And this is a subject on which we have to look collectively. The current legal framework to cover these activities that are not taking place in space but are very high in the space field. Thank you.",3
S1M315,1,3,President,I thank the Ambassador of the United Kingdom. for these very interesting questions. And I give the floor to Professor Wang so that he can answer.,3
S1M316,1,3,China,"Thank you, Mr. President. I think these are some very interesting comments that were formulated by the Ambassador of the United Kingdom. If you allow me, I will start with the second question, which is closely linked to the first one, regarding the threshold and the gray zones that may exist. You asked the question of how to define a threat of force in space. Alors tout d'abord... I must say that the question remains open. But in my opinion... There are elements of actions that have different magnitudes, the use of force in space, the attacks in space. So we have a scale. and whatever the elements on which we lean All of them must respond to the two constitutional elements I mentioned, a subjective perspective and an objective perspective. I will return to the question of the definition of the threat of recourse to force. From a subjective point of view, first of all... We need to have evidence regarding the state of the actor. It must be proven. Another element that is more complex is a subjective judgment regarding the state of the A threat is a subjective element, from the point of view of the state actor than from the one who receives the threat. In an ideal situation... The two states involved should be able to find a consensus to define whether or not it is a threat. Otherwise, we find ourselves simply rejecting the political fault of one side and the other. That's it for the subjective point of view and for the objective point of view now. we must be able to study these questions case by case. We can't just... Find a clear, simple definition that is detached from any particular case. There is a set of factors that play a role in each situation. That's it for the question on the threat of force. Last question. On the application of the existing law in space, especially the international space law. We have discussed these questions in the past, especially regarding the application of Article 9. about activities that may not be considered spatial activities, but which influence what happens in space. This is still my personal point of view. if these activities have effects in space. We can take into account this article and the principle of... de du prise en compte. Space is not one. a target in itself but activities taking place. It was a question of national security. the question of interpretation of the treaties, of the relevance of the law also comes into play. I hope I'm not bothering you with all this, but the legislative detail is very complex. You mentioned it, it's a complex subject, but we have to talk about it. We have to talk about the applicability of the international space law in these gray areas that have been mentioned. If we are not in a period of peace or a period of war, what are the security issues that are at stake? We have to be able to... to check if the right to violence is relevant and what is the role of the existing legal framework. Thank you.",2
S1M317,1,3,President,I thank Professor Wang for his answers. We are not completely finished yet. So I would like to ask Professor Wang to stay with us for a moment. I now give the floor to the representatives of Japan who also had questions to ask.,3
S1M318,1,3,Japan,"Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to sincerely thank the two speakers for their very interesting presentations. My questions are addressed to Professor Wang, who may have already answered some of them, since my question is related to... to the same subject that was mentioned by my previous speakers. You mentioned a very interesting idea, the definition of activities carried out in the space of a point of view as subjective as objective. In my opinion, if an action is considered a military attack, we need to know if there is an intention to carry out an attack or not. We also need to take into account the gravity of the consequences. For example, we can have a non-intentional action that has serious consequences. We can also face a situation in which an intentional action... does not have serious consequences. How is it possible to verify the existence of this intention? I think you have already answered this question, but... If you have other questions, please feel free to ask them now. I would also like to know when and how we can... to have a discussion about this subject in this work group. If you have any suggestions on this subject, I would be grateful. Je vous remercie.",3
S1M319,1,3,President,I thank the representative of Japan for these questions. And I will now give the floor to Professor Wang so that he can answer. You have the floor.,3
S1M320,1,3,China,"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you Japan representative for your questions and comments Thank you for giving me the opportunity to take up the theory that was presented regarding this question of threshold for the first question. I think we are all in the same situation. I tried to explain to you what was the logic that was underlying this idea, as you mentioned. We can try to evaluate if there was a harmful intention on a scale. This type of attack does not necessarily have serious consequences. It is not necessarily a capital element in this case. That was the first stitch. I think we all have a relatively close position on this point. As for the time to discuss these questions, it is an honor to be able to chat with you and participate in the work of this group. And this may be the first time, in any case, I think that... the possibility to exchange on this point. So it's a detailed analysis, but maybe not in depth, but it's the first time I've had the opportunity to present these works in front of this group. I don't think it's my role to tell you when and how to debate these questions. I think each delegation must conduct its research, think about these questions in depth. I come from the university world. for researchers to be able to exchange on our research topics is an essential element. I think most of us are realizing the challenges we face in the framework of the procedures that are part of the security in space. si vous avez... I'm glad to try to answer the questions you asked me. But I think we will have to go through a procedure step by step. And the step we are currently at... must be a period that allows each representative to reflect on these fundamental questions. dernier point I hope we can also come back to subjects that are less sensitive, less delicate, subjects that can be treated with confidence, in order to be able to understand, maybe to set up new mechanisms. as mentioned by the French ambassador. We talked about transparency and confidence measures, coordination measures, crisis control in space. This type of mechanism can be used as a reflection object. And we can also talk about the possibility of applying the international space law. All these different steps. should allow representatives to open their way to fundamental debates on existing challenges. Thank you.",2
S1M321,1,3,President,"I thank Professor Wang for the answers he has brought to these questions. I now have the honor of giving the floor to the representatives of Cuba. We had not heard you yet, we missed your voice.",3
S1M322,1,3,Cuba,"Thank you, Mr. President. I take this opportunity to mention that I am pleased to be able to say that I salute the participation of all the organizations who wanted to participate in the work of the group and you can. We count on the validation of Cuba for the organizations that have asked for the observatory status at this meeting. We welcome all these organizations and we are sure that their presence, their participation in this debate will bring us a lot. I thank the speakers. I am sorry that I can only turn to Professor Wang. since he is the only one to be here with us live. So my questions are addressed to you. Your presentation seemed quite interesting to me, as well as the debates she launched. I had a few comments and a few questions. My comment for Professor Wang is the following. You talked about a responsible or irresponsible behavior. This is a concept that is ambiguous in international law. It's not your fault, it's our fault. because we are inventing concepts that are not suitable for international law in order to reflect political realities. From a legal point of view, any responsible or irresponsible behavior is a conduct, an action that can be attributed to a state that is responsible for it or not, depending on whether this conduct is in accordance with international law in force and applicable to this state. I mention it because, and this is a subject on which you came back, We are talking about sovereignty of the states. This sovereignty implies that no one can qualify the behavior of a state as being responsible or irresponsible unless we are talking about international law. If the behavior of the state respects international law, then it is responsible, otherwise it is irresponsible and the question of responsibility is taken into account. I also had a question. You talked about these... We talked about intentions, consequences. From our point of view, it is not relevant in terms of international law to determine whether a behavior is responsible or not. According to the International Law on Violence, the behavior of states is not judged by the intention or responsibility. The gravity of the damage caused or the amplitude of a consequence is not to be taken into account to qualify the conduct of a state as responsible or irresponsible. I understand what the French ambassador's question was on the subject, and my question is the following. Do you propose that we change the international law in force in order to include these questions of intention, responsibility, consequences as necessary elements to determine the responsibility of a state? Or, on the contrary, do you ask that new international norms such as legally constraining treaties could allow us to bring answers to these complex issues that have been mentioned? Here is my first question. Second question, you mentioned three scenarios. I think that space surveillance is a subject that interests us all, but... There is also a border surveillance, a surveillance of international waters. I would like to ask you the following question. You have presented three scenarios. How would it develop in a military conflict situation? Do you think that a satellite could be considered a military target in case of a military conflict and that it could be the object of an attack, become a target? Last question. You mentioned the complexity of the role of private actors in these scenarios. You were not with us yesterday when our colleagues from the United States and France mentioned this subject. It was mentioned that the states were responsible for the behavior of these private companies in space. But there is another element that still complicates the situation and on which I wanted to return. The damages on a third state. Here we talked about a situation in two states. I would like to know if, according to you, international law in force gives the possibility to a third state, which is neither an actor nor a target, to the right? to ask for repairs for actions that would have caused damage. So I would like to know if you consider that in the current legal context of activities carried out in space, a third state that has nothing to do with an action carried out may ask for reparations for damages or because they consider that a norm of international law would have been violated. Finally. You talked about the prohibition of the use of force, contrary to international law. And I would like to know if you consider that the use, that a threat of force use... Uh, poo. to be linked to the deployment of weapons in space. Thank you.",3
S1M323,1,3,President,"I'm sorry for maybe abusing my time of speech. Thank you. I thank the representative of Cuba for his questions and comments. I would like to thank you, the Cuban delegation, who validated the participation of non-governmental organizations who asked to participate in our session. It seems to me to be quite important because we all appreciate the participation of these NGOs in our work. back to Professor Wang to the remarks and the questions that have been raised by our distinguished Cuban colleague. I hope they can respond to the questions, to the comments that have been made.",3
S1M324,1,3,China,"Thank you. Mr. President, I thank Cuba for the questions and I thank the interpreters. I am trying to understand your main concerns. You have asked three questions. You talked about dichotomy between responsible and irresponsible. I totally agree with you. l'année passée. During the conference on this new initiative, I said exactly the same thing. So I agree with you. If there is no common interpretation on the legality or illegality of a given behaviour, it would be risky. to define whether it is responsible or irresponsible from a political point of view. In my presentation, I spoke about the threshold, objectively and subjectively. I did not talk about a specific threshold of behavior that could be considered irresponsible or more irresponsible to determine if there is an armed attack in space. The first question you asked. is very interesting, very important. say to just throw out. You know. So do we have to... The question of the existing international law and what we have to do about it. Does the United Nations Treaty, for example, on space apply? is capable of maintaining space safety. But the problem, I have said it several times, is that the application is not sure for us all when we talk about security issues in space. especially when we take into account the rapid evolution of space technology. The first possibility is that we have to study what we have to determine the applicability of the Lex Lata. And then the documents of the IT are also useful to judge legality. of a military scenario in space, as well as the right to the responsibility of the States. In addition... We will not be able to discuss a new legal instrument against Rennes. The constraint instrument is always effective, we know that, but the problem is... If these questions are very difficult on the theoretical level, such as thresholds, etc., we could write them in an adequate way in a treaty, I do not believe it. It is rather in the process of implementation or interpretation that each state determines its own discretion, legality or behavior threshold. or harm others because of this activity. I just mentioned this to draw the attention of the delegates on this question. The analysis of the Alex Lata is not contrary to a discussion on a new treaty. That's it, to answer your first question. I spoke of three scenarios... What would be the legality? If I understood you well. espionage, les activités de surveillance d'espionage ou de contre espionage pendant un conflit armé qui existe déjà sur terre, si j'ai bien compris votre question. Well, that would mean that we would be at the stage of the conflict in space. The first line of defense, I would say, would have collapsed, that is to say the paros. That would mean that we cannot agree on a paros treaty that would prevent the armed conflict in space. And so we have to ask ourselves two questions. And that's very interesting. First question, the applicability of the DH in space. And secondly. Are the other elements of international law in peace terms applicable? Is the new Article of the Treaty on the Space and the Atmospheric Treaty applicable in Spain during a conflict? Or during an armed conflict on Earth? That's what I can answer to your second question. And finally, if it is enough. Does the C State have the right to take measures to react? Of course, but it depends. All this happens in different legal systems. In my presentation, I relied on the principle of non-resistance to force and the right to legitimate defense. or step B. In this scenario. to destroy. There are parasites. Another micro is on, maybe, and we can hear papers. And in other legal systems, the right to responsibility of the states could also apply. So the C state could demand, claim the application of a countermeasure mechanism in the law of the responsible state. This could be considered an illicit international act. But It would allow the A or C States to re-establish their illicit act. So, in short, the state still has... of the rights in the different systems, whether it is the international right of space or other elements of international law. If we are... That's why I say that it is more urgent for us to discuss the application of relevant law in scenarios of low intensity. I lost your last question. But if you want to repeat, I can complete my answers.",2
S1M325,1,3,President,"Thank you very much, Professor Wang. of these very circumstantial answers. And now I will give the floor. to the representative of Chile.",3
S1M326,1,3,Chile,"Thank you Mr. President. Mr. President, thank you very much for your presentations and the organization of this debate meeting. With yesterday's one, we had the most interesting discussions that I have participated in recent years. I also thank Professor Wang for being available today to answer our questions. I will speak English. Professor Wang. Thank you very much for your presentation. I'm also... Thank you for your presentation. I'm also a little bit... bad at Zoom. I sometimes have trouble finding the buttons. So... You answered a question from my Cuban friend who asked me. If I understood correctly, you said that you were not particularly convinced of this new approach of responsible behaviour and that you made remarks about it last year. So my question is, why not? Why? Is it a concept that does not exist internationally? because it may be politicized, or because it slows progress towards a limiting instrument, or anything else, everything I just mentioned. Second question. Regarding the space portfolio, we quickly realize that we have two terms that we cannot confuse. militarization and weaponization. Armament. It's difficult in Spanish because weaponization is not a word. You have to do a whole sentence. But quickly, my question, from the point of view of your university experience and your observations, is the militarization of space, that is to say, the importance of the growth of military systems, of space systems in military operations, plus the dual nature of a large number of space objects, is becoming synonymous or is approaching? And if so, what would be the consequences in terms of international law, and especially in the context of the negotiation of a constrained instrument? Thank you very much.",3
S1M327,1,3,President,"I thank the representative of Chile for her comments and questions. Professor Wang, I really apologize. You are a little on the edge. It's a little difficult. You may not have expected that. But we appreciate your presence and I give you the floor.",3
S1M328,1,3,China,"Thank you, President. Yes, it's difficult for me. But finally, it's the kind of challenge that we university students like. Thank you very much for the intervention of our colleague from Chile. To start, you are absolutely right. I would hesitate to accept this dichotomy between responsible and irresponsible. In this case, it is better to talk about political issues. But from a legal perspective... Just like responsibility. This is a legal term, responsibility. We see it in the treaty and the right to responsibility of states. If we talk about responsibility in the right of space, it is always a responsible state, that is to say, a state is the state that has the jurisdiction and control of space activities and space objects or a process in space. In the law of responsibility of the States, responsibility means the consequences. This means that you are supposed to take positive measures to acquire your obligations or to offer repairs or to apologize. These are the legal consequences that are involved. It would be difficult for a lawyer. to define what is a responsible behavior. This is a first point. Second. In this case, it would be a crime to indicate that a behavior that would not meet certain standards of law, such as the soft law, or the guidelines on the attenuation of debris, could be considered irresponsible. and it would raise the threshold in a useless way, which would allow a non-specified country to have access to space. So there is confusion between the line between which the instruments are separated and those that are not. Personally, I would have trouble defining the behavior of a State. I do not know if I could say your illegal or irresponsible behavior. For your second question. I took note, I'm sorry, I'm looking for the name of the concept you mentioned. Well, I'll come back to that later. And I'll take your last question right away. Militarization and weaponization. in terms of the risks of today. There is another term in Chinese, which I am looking for a translation in English. It means to take the extra atmospheric space as a theater. or a theater of operations. I don't know how to say it in English. Could we treat all this in a treaty? I'm not sure. You talked about dual character, especially because of the dual character of all these activities and objects. We have the same kind of problem when we try to find a definition of what a space weapon is. To judge if an activity is military, commercial or civilian, it is important to judge it, but it must not be considered as a prerequisite for... to show a political will to negotiate a restrictive treaty. I'm trying to find some useful things. we could say that if a behaviour is considered a threat, etc. then at that moment, we can only talk about space weapons. How do we judge the military objective? It must be defined by many elements belonging to this specific scenario. it could be cut off by the fact that the private sector, for example, was doing military operations before... or because it was done by the military department. and that there are military contracts that have been passed with a private entity, but all this must be analyzed case by case to find out if in the specific XY scenario The objective is military. I am really sorry for your second question. which was based on the concept of responsibility, isn't it? But if we still have the opportunity to come back to this, I would be happy to...",2
S1M329,1,3,President,"Thank you, Professor Wang. I have bad news for you. Your calvary is not finished. We have only two speakers who asked for the floor. It's because you are the only present panelist, but your presentation was so interesting that it aroused so much interest. So it's a little bit of your fault. You were too interesting and that's why you generated this kind of reaction. I will now give the floor to the Portuguese lady.",3
S1M330,1,3,Portuguese,"Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Professor Wang and Professor Malov for presenting their expertise. This format of discussion is quite favorable to my delegation. I thank all delegations who spoke before me to actively participate in this dialogue. I had questions that were already asked before me by the delegations that have already intervened, but I still have a little challenge to ask Professor Wang. His general theory of thresholds is very interesting, since it carries on an approach based on behaviors supported by my delegation in particular. irresponsible, celui qui est le nôtre à vous poser tant de questions, vraiment mes compliments aux professeurs de relever brillamment le gant. I would like the professor to develop the threat and the use of force in light of the different scenarios that this implies. Could you... I would like to mention specific complexities that would arise from the threat of the use of force or the use of force depending on the consequences that the threat or the use of force may have and how these consequences are felt, in particular simply in space or from the point of view of earth-space or space-earth.",3

I would like to ask a new question, an additional question to Professor Wang about the very speaking scenarios that he presented to us, especially the trilateral scenarios, if I may say so. And if you allow me, Professor Wang, I would like to add a level of complexity to your trilateral scenario by asking you... comment vous comprenez the situation of a C state which is suffering damage due to the action of the state A against the state B whereas the C state does not have does not have in space but is content to use spatial services which are lent to it, for example, by a of the space object of the state B.

And the term responsible behavior or irresponsible does not worry me much. We, as jurists, can use this kind of term. Professor Wang said something that made me jump on the law of responsibility. I would like to make a remark on this. It may not be fair that we engage in a debate on the applicability of the different rules of the law of responsibility. It is a secondary source of international law. It is better that we focus on the primary rules that apply to space. and that we look at how this applies rather than entering into the rules of countermeasures, and illicit, etc. This is a small remark that I wanted to make in passing, do not let us turn away from the essential.",2
S1M335,1,3,President,Thank you to the representative of the Netherlands. And now we will move on to our Italian colleague.,2
S1M336,1,3,Italy,"Italian, unfortunately, is not enough. Since this is the first time that our delegation is speaking under your presidency, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your accession to these responsibilities and you can count on the support and cooperation of the Italian delegation. I would like to thank the invited speakers for their very interesting presentation, who will contribute to advance our work, especially in terms of the international law examination a forceful use of force in international affairs, in the context of a threat, that comes from a behavior of a State. in the field of space. As a result of Article 3 of the Space Treaty, the International Law and the United Nations Charter for military operations in space, as well as the right of treaties in space, and given the complexity of the space domain, the nature of the legal links a space object and a State could be complicated in the context of the use of force or an attack against the State concerned. So an obvious legal link between a space object and a State is the immatriculation. So I would like Professor Wang to develop this legal relationship to promote a better matriculation practice. And the professor could tell us if this could bring some clarity in all this.",4
S1M338,1,3,China,"Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the speakers for their questions. As you indicated, Mr. President. I am responsible for my irresponsible behavior during my presentation. I'm joking, of course. You have raised points on which it is interesting to stop. I come back to the question of the representative of Portugal, to start. We actually have to discuss this question of a threshold, but... My work in this presentation was focused on the determination of the contexts of attack, how to determine the threat of the use of force, the use of force or an attack. We have tried to discuss different scenarios. As far as the evaluation level of a threat is concerned, I can present a more specific scenario in the case I mentioned. I think that the scenario for the approach flights is perhaps the most relevant depending on the operations of appointment and proximity. Even if there is no direct contact or use of weapons and energy directed. to have the result of causing interference. The orbit operations can be the source of misunderstandings and misappreciation. between states concerned. This type of maneuver can be perceived as a threat of force but the state acting, the state that considers the threat, must be able to explain why. It must not be short. a forceful use of force in space or the implementation of countermeasures which could lead to an escalation of the situation. to lead to new conflicts. In such a scenario, other principles must be taken into account, such as self-management, self-regulation, the behavior of a state. although it is not necessarily prohibited by international law, does not mean that the state should not be careful before making a decision about its behaviour in space. The states must show restraint to avoid misunderstandings that could lead to a serious situation. It is a principle that must be kept in mind when we seek solutions in the matter of security in space. There are two scenarios regarding this retention. It may be a difficult level to reach, but we have to tend towards this retention. We know that a behavior or another can be considered irresponsible. in an ideal situation, in a functional situation. Each actor should show the reminiscence of the militarization or other types of scenarios. I now return to the question of the European Union. If a state has suffered losses, but that these losses have not been directly caused by spatial goods, but in terms of service use, State A is always supposed to respect its obligations in terms of due regards. A key element here is the concept of pre-visibility. the law applicable in the C state. or the reaction of state C can be predictable, provided by state A. Is there a causal link between the behavior of state A, which is the origin of the damage caused by a satellite attack, and the losses endured by state C? a compensation asked by State C to State A could be questioned on the topic of Article 9, in my opinion. I'll move on to the question of the Netherlands. You have come back to the question of the opportune moment or not to debate the responsibility and the right to apply the matter. You mentioned a secondary source of law. In the framework of the projects I participated in, I must say that most of the people involved, if not all of them, consider that the right to responsibility of the States is a customary international right, which would not be in this case a secondary source of rights. Is it necessary to discuss this? This should allow us to determine who is responsible in the case of repairs that need to be made. This is an important issue that I believe has been raised in the context of our exchanges. It is important to determine first the illegality of an action in this international context. The right to state responsibility cannot be left aside. In any case, that would be my opinion on this point. I will come back in a moment for my presentation. We will work on this legal analysis, on identifying specific questions. Perhaps this group is not the platform to discuss these issues. But if we engage in the voice of a new treaty, of a new legally binding instrument, that could be the case. Last question, asked by Italy. as regards the existing legal links between certain behaviors or spatial assets and certain states. I have an idea, maybe not creative, but that could give a thought, to go and base it on the works of Professor Wing Chun. It's an idea that has never been debated in the background, for what I know. which has not been the subject of an official debate over the past 10 years. It's a subject that I discussed with my colleagues from different countries. It's about the nationality of space engines. It's a simple way to define a jurisdiction, a legal link, but it's a subject that hasn't been the subject of an official discussion. We have a... treated with the parameters of general order matriculation concerning the spatial goods. But we know that there is a... a gap between the moment when an object is launched and the moment when it is unregistered. It can take from 6 months to 1 year, 2 years, 3 years. So from a legal point of view... We don't have a legal concept that is recognized by the treaties for this intermediate period. The question of the property is taken into account, the fact of knowing from which state an object was launched into space, and we also have this question of nationality. We can make a link with the air or sea law. We have a pavilion for airplanes or ships, but we did not apply this same principle to space objects. in any case it is not recognized in the international space law. The legal links. I suggest that we evaluate a new regime, that we lean on a new regime that may not be studied in Geneva, but it is a subject on which I encourage you to lean. I can't define who has the jurisdiction on what device. It can be a complex discussion, but it can be a starting point for the regulation of the different in space. I thank you once again very sincerely. I thank the people who took care of the organization of this meeting. I'm glad to have been able to chat with you. These debates will serve as starting points for... to make it a functional framework to solve space security issues. Thank you again.",2
S1M339,1,3,President,"I thank Professor Wang. This performance is extraordinary, an experience that represents an unusual challenge, if it's about one scene. I'm sure everyone will agree with me. You passed this test with Brio. There are of course other questions that we would have to ask you, but we will stick to it for the moment and move on to our work. Thank you. We will return to point 5 as of today, general changes of view. We already have a list of speakers, of requests for speech, for this point at the end of the day. And I start by giving the floor to the representative of the Argentine delegation. You have the floor.",3
S1M340,1,3,Argentine,"I thank you. First of all, I would like to congratulate you for your access to the Presidency of this meeting and for the way you manage our work. You can count on the full support of my delegation, which will participate in this session and the next session of the group in a constructive way. For my delegation, the exploration and use of space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, must be done... for the benefit of all countries, both in their scientific and economic development, and for the benefit of all humanity. And the right to be in force is based on the principle that the exploration and use of space must be done in the interest of all humanity, in accordance with Article 1 of the Treaty on Space of 1967. Should the use of space be peaceful? An activity that is not peaceful in space could be done for the benefit of one or a few countries, but never for the benefit of all of humanity, as required by Article 1 of the 1967 Treaty. In this context, my delegation wishes to reiterate its position regarding the principles that must govern the activities of the states in terms of exploration and the use of space, particularly the universal and egalitarian access to space for all countries without discrimination, regardless of their level of scientific, technical and economic development. The equitable and rational use of the Earth's space is in the interest of all of humanity. The principle of non-appropriation of space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, no state has the right to appropriate these elements, to claim sovereignty by occupation or in any other way. The non-militarization of space, which cannot be used to deploy nuclear weapons or massive destruction. and the use of space for improving the living conditions of peoples and peace. The responsibility of the states and international organizations for the damages caused in space or the damages caused to physical or moral persons subjected to their jurisdiction. The application of international law, including the United Nations Charter in space activities. Mr President, my delegation is concerned that there is still a lack of a force in the regime that does not prohibit the placement of conventional weapons in orbit. This lack is evident by the provisions of the treaty that expressly forbid the use of weapons on the moon or other celestial bodies. In this context, Argentina considers it important to clarify the terms we use, because it would not be legitimate for weapons of any type to be deployed in space. As for the work of this group, my delegation considers that at this first step of our work, we should at least look at the definition and scope of certain concepts. It would be important to understand what the term threat covers, so that we can enter into the background debates on a common understanding of these terms. As for the questions related to the prevention of the arms race, which are the responsibility of the First Commission of the General Assembly and the Conference on the Disarmament, it seems to us that this concept of threat must be... read together with the work carried out by the Community of Pacific Uses of Space. This committee is the best in the United Nations to be able to debate in a comprehensive manner all the issues related to the Pacific use of space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, including space regulation. As far as tasks to be carried out are concerned, In the future, the work carried out by the two subcommissions, the study on the formulation of recommendations, rules and principles of responsible conduct concerning threats in space, we must also evaluate the work carried out by the Committee on the Pacific Uses of Space. for the implementation of rules and principles of responsible behavior, rules and guidelines that must be applied or analyzed. We are talking about attenuation of the effects of debris in space. This is a topic discussed by the working group on the durability of activities in space. These are works that could be linked to those of our working group. On the other hand, in order to effectively avoid a race to armament in space and to prohibit the deployment of weapons in space, it seems to us that we should agree on the terminology because it would not be legitimate that weapons of any kind be deployed in space or that it is on celestial bodies or in orbit. We could also look at other definitions that would be necessary to clarify our legal interpretation. Mr. President, the durability of activities in space, in the short and long term, requires that the international community commit to never using weapons in space. Argentina supports the negotiations that are taking place in the context of the disarmament conference in favour of the implementation of a treaty that prohibits the deployment of weapons in space. The adoption of international measures of transparency and confidence in space activities is necessary and appropriate. We could also adopt measures like the ones that have been mentioned, which would have a genetically demanding character. I am thinking about the notification and recording of activities in space. As for the treaty on the prevention of a arms race, I have the following comments in the name of my delegation. Our priority would be to ensure a greater degree of mutual trust and responsibility. For this, regional and universal cooperation in the field of the development of space activities would be an important tool. This would create synergies and raise awareness of the benefits that science and space technology can bring in terms of sustainable development. The prevention of the arms race must be through the regulation of behavior and control of the capabilities of equipment and technologies. Taking into account the double nature of space technologies, we should pay particular attention to ensuring that we do not interfere with the development and acquisition of technologies and equipment that are used in the context of a peaceful use of space. A verifiable and desirable mechanism, although the development of an instrument The law is difficult to implement with such a mechanism. Finally, knowing that the context in which spatial activities are developing represents technological challenges, I am thinking in particular about the participation of the private sector, the university sector. In the future, when it comes to the issue of non-race prevention, we should focus on technologies that can promote this race and the role of the various players. Finally, Mr. President, my delegation would like to once again give you its support in the conduct of our work. Thank you.",4
S1M341,1,3,President,"I thank the representative of Argentina. comments and for the support it brings to the work of this group. I now give the floor to the representatives of the SRI, in case you have the floor.",2
S1M342,1,3,Sri Lanks,"Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to first of all salute the way you conduct our work and remind you of our full cooperation in the progress of our work in favor of a positive success. I would like to return to the prevention of the arms race in space, a subject that was born in the early 1980s when states in development... are focused on the use of space for the benefit of humanity, which should only be used for peaceful purposes. In 1985, the Sri Lanka proposed a moratorium on the development of weapons deployed in space before multilateral negotiations on a treaty banning the deployment of weapons in space. In this context, we know that technologies are essential in maintaining civil, national and international infrastructure. They enable activities in terms of security and saving on Earth. Moreover, the blurred border between civil and military commercial activities and space technologies is a matter of concern in terms of safety and stability in space. to ensure that space remains a peaceful space of exploration that is done for the benefit of humanity. We are sincerely concerned with the armament of space and the possibility of a race for armament in space. The prevention of this race for armament would be much easier to implement than a de-escalation. The development of space capabilities, including the sending of space forces by certain nations involved in this field, the questions in the field of anti-satellite capabilities show that it is urgent that we agree on limits in order to ensure that we can do so. that no conflict can break out in space. Sri Lanka supports the resolution of the first commission entitled to reduce space threats by means of rules of conduct principles responsible in accordance with our position to support all multilateral initiatives aimed at promoting the peaceful use of space. Sri Lanka supports the work of this group. The discussions we are having here must come to an intermediate stage before the development of a legally binding treaty, including verification measures. We hope that the progress made and our common understanding on this point will not be left aside in the framework of this new initiative. Many States have highlighted over the years that it was necessary to clarify the legal situation concerning space and that the legal framework had to be built on the basis of existing texts. Look The implementation of systems in space and weapons in space is our concern. The Space Treaty is an interesting cornerstone for the negotiation of other instruments that can respond to technological advances. The concerns concerning the proliferation of debris in space. to have to be treated in new instruments. The presentations of the speakers this morning regarding the lack of clarity on the consequences in the event of irresponsible behavior, push us to act on these questions. In conclusion... We hope that the deliberations carried out within this group will allow us to develop norms accepted at the international level and measures of transparency, of constitution, of confidence that will allow us to then take more ambitious steps, including the development of a legally restrictive instrument on the subject.",4
S1M343,1,3,President,I thank the representative of Sri Lanka for her intervention and for the support she brings I now give the floor to... You have the floor.,2
S1M344,1,3,United Arab,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since this is our... We are fully committed to our work and are also trying to promote the implementation of measures of transparency and confidence. We believe that in order to maintain peace and security, as well as the safety, stability and durability of space, a legal framework based on international law and international treaties should be considered. The United Arab Emirates encourages Member States to bring their activities into space in a transparent and open manner. We consider that the international community should engage in favor of exploration and peaceful use of space and should avoid activities that are against international obligations, including those that could threaten the capacity of states to use and explore space in a peaceful manner. We share concerns about the threats that weigh on space assets and the threat of a space arms race. In this context, we assure you of our commitment in favor of the development of measures and means that guarantee the safety and security of space. The United Arab Emirates is committed to international efforts to prevent non-proliferation and disarmament. We encourage Member States to act actively in this area. The United Arab Emirates reiterates the importance of continuing to take measures in favor of the safety and security of activities in space. We also encourage the international community to continue to take into account the issues of security in space and stability in the widest possible way. We are trying to promote a multilateral and regional cooperation on the subject. Mr. President, my delegation would like to thank you for giving us the floor and we repeat once again that we will bring our full support to the work of the working group in favor of its success.",4
S1M345,1,3,President,"I thank the representatives of the United Arab Emirates for their intervention, for their support for the work of this group. I now give the floor to the representative of Chile. You have the floor.",2
S1M346,1,3,Chile,"Je vous remercie, Monsieur le Président. This is the first formal intervention of CHELI for this first session of the Unlimited Workgroup on the Reduction of Space Threats by means of rules and principles of responsible behavior. I would like to repeat that the Chilean is pleased to see you preside over this work group. You can count on our full support and participation in discussions that will take place this week. Mr. President. For the Shelly, the use and the peaceful exploration of space is a key principle. It is also an important issue for economic and social development linked to the peaceful use of space. It is a common good of humanity and all states have the right to contribute to this debate on a foot of equality. access, knowledge that comes from space activities and technologies that are deployed, their applications in the field of innovation, education, have effects on the development of each country. It is a fundamental role that space exploration plays to allow states to reach ODDs. It also helps to mitigate the risks of global threats, such as the risks associated with climate change. These technological advances in practice create a complex dependency between space goods in critical activities on Earth. The increasingly important integration of private actors, the possible interruption of space services for accidental reasons or... Malveya represents challenges in the field of security in space, both in terms of physical security and in terms of technological security or security. These threats exist in the short, medium and long term. All this pushes us to make the necessary efforts to set up a regime of governance that allows us to respond to these new challenges. The Chile therefore recognizes the resolution 76-231 which allows us to advance the multilateral dialogue on the subject. We will focus on a global approach. We consider that this will strengthen the international legal framework in the matter. We must reach the consensus that will allow us to implement the necessary measures. We have wanted to participate in other initiatives that seek to support security in space. We are participating in the Governmental Expert Group on Transparency Measures and Confidence Enforcement. We did it in 2013. We have also participated in the Paros until 2019. We also support the directives on long-term viability of activities in space, among other things. We are happy to compromise the United States not to do anti-satellite tests, as the delegation of the United States said yesterday. This commitment has its limitations, but it is a step, a concrete step, I underline, in the right direction. As the Canadian delegation said yesterday, We hope that it will be possible to make great initiatives. As for the subject that interests us, I would like to thank the panelists and say what follows in general. And I take up, it will summarize what I said yesterday. Today, we are in favor of the application of international law and the United Nations Charter in Space. As for international law, the legal framework on the space the treaties that must govern the activities of the States in the exploration and use of space. For example, the 1967 treaty on the space of the atmosphere, which is the legal framework on international law, which applies to this space. As was said in the report of the Presidency of the Governmental Experts Group on the Paros, with practical measures to prevent the arms race in space, or to participate in the Chilean, there are principles, the treaty on space, to codify these rector principles, which are very important for today's discussions. A. The applicability of the United Nations Charter in the extra-atmospheric space. B. The freedom of access to space without any discrimination and on a foot of equality. C. non-deployment of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the extra-atmospheric space. D, use of the moon and other celestial bodies exclusively for peaceful purposes. E, responsibility of the States for national activities carried out in space. F, responsibility of the States for the launch of damage. Then, to keep in mind other parties in the use and exploration of the extra-atmospheric space. to consult before proceeding to any activity that may have a negative impact on the activities of others in the extra-atmospheric space. Let us not forget that when we talk about the Treaty on Space, for Chile the ethical dimension is essential, which accompanies interpretation and which is subject to this treaty. When we talk about the norms on the exploration and use of the extra-atmospheric space, For the good of all humanity, the authors had in mind global security as a principal director more than the national security of each country. This is where we see in the treaty an ethical dimension. that gives or that puts above the interests of a state or a group of states the global interests. As far as the principles of the United Nations Charter are concerned, I would like to mention the principles that must always apply in taking into account the characteristics of the extra-atmospheric space. A. Forbidden threat of the utilization of force. B. The peaceful regulation of differences. C. The right of legitimate defense, individual and collective. We share the panelist's prudence today on the need to concentrate efforts on the ban on threats or use of force in any state of cause, by applying it, by adjusting to the characteristics of the case. the primacy of the Charter on the Other International Obligations. In the general framework of international law, we also underline the applicability of humanitarian international law in the context of a possible military operation conducted in the context of an armed conflict, in particular in the space of the atmosphere. As the CICR says in its work documents today, it is a simple observation. The applicability of a legal regime in the face of the necessity of protecting civil populations if there is a military operation during an armed conflict, whatever the legality of the use of force. The international humanitarian law does not legitimize, as it has been said several times by the CICR, the space, nor the deployment of weapons in space. On this basis... Thank you. We can identify the responsible behavior that allows us to respect the primary objective of a mentioned legal instrument, as well as the objectives and resolutions on which our work is concerned. This means maintaining physical, technical security and the durability of activities in the space. Finally, Mr. President, under the angle of legal integration and given the fact that the current legal space regime The international law is not linked to the law in space. We therefore consider that it would be useful for this group to take into account four sources that can serve to establish huge rules and principles of responsible behavior that were reported by UNIDIR yesterday, that is to say the other international instruments that affect the aspects of the space and that may have been negotiated outside the United Nations, the ban on using techniques to modify the environment to the extent of lethal or hostile. An international law and disarmament instrument specifically linked to environmental protection. B, the provision of the export control and technology regime. VASNAR is the code of conduct of the AES, which governs the use and use of these weapons. Secondly, other frameworks that could allow to interpret the provisions of the Treaty on Space, for example the Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is a practical application of what is called the law of the state, so in terms of signaling, regard, tout chose qui vont être traités par des panélistes et sur lesquels nous reviendrons le moment venu. Merci beaucoup. Je remercie la représentante du Chili de son intervention et de son soutien au travail de ce groupe et maintenant j'ai le plaisir de donner la parole à l'Espagne.",4
S1M347,1,3,Germany,"Thank you, Mr. President. Spain has signed the declaration of the European Union. I would like to start this first intervention as a national by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this working group and the way you have led the debates, which is quite satisfying. We can count on your collaboration. I would like to thank the United Kingdom for the initiative. Mr. President, a reflection on the... that we are leading is absolutely important. Spain condemns the military aggression absolutely unjustified by the federation of Russia. Spain has continued to support sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. In addition to these geopolitical tensions, the appearance of new actors In space technologies, the majority of double-use requires better regulation of space activities. We believe that this work group will move forward in this direction. We are confident that this group will be an open dialogue framework and will allow to put a price to a possible arms race, something particularly important today. Mr. President, Spain thanks this new VELAX on the behaviors responsible in space. We are convinced that the standards and measures of transparency and confidence will contribute to the durability and security of the space and reduce the risks of perception and calculation errors. to space, it was highlighted by the states. Spain considers that this exercise... We can't help but think about how we can create new, more complex and complex treaties. Throughout the presentations, it has been clear that we are not starting from scratch and that there are two ways to continue to develop the legal regime of space, to deepen the framework of existence, which implies to clarify certain notions, etc. Or to develop new, more complex instruments that complete the treaty on space. which addresses security in a more specific way, and takes into account technological advances. Spain considers that these two options can be complementary. And this working group, so whatever it is, the future instruments that we will be able to... We will have to complete the 1960 net treaty and understand the proper verification mechanisms, and discover the relevant threats, including those that have been involved in space, from space to Earth and from Earth to space. From this perspective, we salute the fact that the United States is committed to not doing destructive anti-satellite tests, which is going in the right direction. As we saw yesterday, the practice of repeating states... contributes to creating responsible behavior. Mr. President, we are obliged to see strong participation in this group. These questions are very important and we need a space community that includes all groups, non-governmental representatives, the various ministers, experts, industry, civil society and multilateral organizations, including technicians. In this moment of great tension, the maintenance of the international security is therefore necessary measures that contribute to strengthening trust. Thank you.",1
S1M348,1,3,President,"The interpreter apologizes. This text was read at supersonic speed and we did not have the text. Thank you to Germany for this intervention. And now, says the president, I give the floor to Switzerland.",2
S1M349,1,3,Switzerland,"President, let us speak for the first time. I would like to thank you for the way you have organized our work and you provide full support to my delegation. Mr. President, Switzerland fully supports the establishment of the non-limited composition of the space threats by means of rules, rules and principles of responsible behavior. These past few years, we have been involved in important developments in the space of the atmosphere. All states are increasingly dependent on space systems, particularly for their economic and social development, and the activities and activities of the space of the atmosphere are multiplying. The congestion and competition between the states that result in it have led to an increase in security, security and sustainability challenges in space activities. At the same time, military competition between certain states in space has increased, threatening to expand to extra-atmospheric space. We salute the fact that progress has been made in order to provide an answer to the risks and dangers in the space especially in the form of the adoption of 2019 of 21 guidelines on the long-term durability of space activities by the Committee on Pacific Uses of the Space, the COPIO, and the United Nations General Assembly. It is now imperative to act to also meet the challenges of a safe nature. From the Swiss point of view, we must be careful that armed conflicts do not extend to space and avoid any interference with the exploration and use of space at peaceful ends. It is therefore essential to take measures to progress in the reinforcement of the international normative framework in the matter of security and stability of space in the interests of all. In this respect, the elaboration of common understanding of what constitutes a responsible behavior in space is a promising approach that could complete the existing legal framework in a significant way. It could also help us evolve towards stricter and legally restrictive measures in the future. Given the difficulties inherent in evaluating space activities, without mentioning the difficulty of evaluating the intention that subverts certain actions, an approach focused on behavior and results constitutes a promising path. The emphasis placed on behavior and its consequences allows us to evaluate the results of an action given independently of its supposed or real intention. In addition, a behavioral approach could also bring more clarity on the development and deployment of space weapons and on how to prevent them. Mr President, in our opinion, this working group should consider a series of measures to prevent space from becoming the theatre of a military confrontation, by strengthening the implementation of existing obligations in favor of international law, by improving transparency, notification, knowledge of the situation in space, and international collaboration. In addition, we should also consider restricting certain activities and certain behaviors, for example by prohibiting the use of force against space systems or by limiting certain types of activities that have deleterious effects on space objects or the orbital environment. In this context, we are particularly concerned about a certain number of developments that affect the security and stability of space. The development and proliferation of anti-satellite weapons, including those launched from Earth, are particularly worrying. These weapons have obvious risks, including the production of long-term debris that put in danger the security, safety and durability of space activities, including those of civil nature and therefore the stability of space. The intentional creation of space debris should, in our opinion, be generally prohibited. In this respect, Switzerland has read all unilateral announcements to not carry out destructive anti-satellite missile tests and supports the efforts aimed at strengthening its national commitments by international, harmonized and restrictive norms. The placement of weapons in space under the form of weapons and space on the ground or interceptor of missiles is also likely to increase the risk of transforming space into a combat area and a negative impact on the security and stability of space. Countermeasures to these threats would pose additional risks to the security and stability of space. but the preoccupations are not limited to the development or deployment of certain capacities, they also extend to the way in which certain activities are carried out in space. For example, the pollution of orbits requires techniques such as operations of round-the-clock and orbital proximity and object capture, which could be used not only for peaceful purposes, but also for hostile purposes and therefore have a risk of misinterpretation. The deliberate approach of a satellite of a foreign power without coordination, knowledge or prior consent can be interpreted as an hostile act and incite them to equip their satellite with defensive capabilities, which in turn raises questions about the placement of weapons in space. The adoption of transparency and security measures is therefore essential during operations of proximity. Mr. President, We must conclude that there is still much to do to develop and meet the necessary standards to guarantee stability and security in space, provided for a long-term and peaceful use of space. We hope that our working group will be able to give positive and sustainable impulses, with the ultimate goal of meeting appropriate standards and legal principles to contain the multiple threats from, and from space. The same is true of the growing number of civil and commercial actors in space. It is essential that representatives of the industry, the university world and civil society organizations can attend our meetings and take part in our deliberations. Mr. President, thank you.",0

We hope that the working group, based on its mandate received from the resolution of the General Assembly on behavior, norms, rules and principles, will have a responsible behavior principle, will have a responsible exchange, and we will be able to find a consensus and engage in the prevention of the arms race in space. Mr. President. The space concerns the security and well-being of humanity. must be addressed in the spirit of sharing the future for all. And space has contributed to human civilization, to economic and social development for the good of all countries. But security in space is increasingly threatened. The prevention of the arms race is essential for peace, peace and security of the space. In history, in reality, If there is a race for armament, it is because a power is trying to dominate space, like a sword of Damocles who is weighing on space. Some countries remain in their mentality of the cold war and try to take advantage. with operations, with plans in space, they try to dominate space and consider it as a war zone. In particular, they can use commercial aircraft, combat systems, they do military exercises in the context of military alliances and test their preparation for combat. and they are trying to accelerate the strengthening of the capacities of certain military and political blocs. We consider that they must collectively defend space, which represents a risk of space armament and a negative impact on strategic stability, and this poses a long-term threat to peace and security in space. Since humanity explored space for the first time, the international community is preparing to prevent a new battlefield from taking place in space. The General Assembly adopted a resolution on the use of space in the Pacific to avoid national rivalries in space. In 1978, the first special session was held The General Assembly adopted a resolution asking the CDC to find a legally binding instrument on the Paros. Last year, the resolution was adopted by consensus. In the last two years, the majority of countries have supported the resolution on the behavior of the Paros. This shows that the general point of view of the international community is to conclude a treaty to control disarmament in space, the foundation of a discussion on the behaviors responsible in space. To be honest, if we judge the discussions in the General Assembly, and reports from the General Secretaries, the parties have different positions and make proposals on what the responsible behavior is. So much so that it is only more necessary for this group to respect multilateralism on a level of equality, to manage the divergences of views and to make speeches to avoid discrimination, politicization and exclusion. For this group to propose results that are universally accepted, we need an approach by consensus. China considers that international discussions on responsible behavior must respond to the following principles. A security in the universal space. Countries with the most capacity must have the most responsibility. With responsible behavior, a super-powerful power must not ensure domination in space. Countries must refrain from keeping their security at the expense of others. We must guarantee together a shared future for all. to seek common and global security, and to have a responsibility. Secondly, to seek the objectives of the Paros and to strengthen international efforts in view of a negotiated treaty. Countries must apply the work of the foundation of the CEDE. and therefore demonstrate responsible behavior towards space. Since China presided over the conference this year, it has succeeded in finding a work program to advance on the Paros and other essential points of the order of the day and has built a new platform. Since 2008, China and the Russian Federation have presented and This is the only official proposal regarding the Paros. This text forbids the deployment of weapons in space and forbids the threat or the use of force against space objects. The dual nature of space technology makes things complicated. The text proposed by China and Russia is a solution of international law that is constructive. This year, we will be able to measure if the behavior of countries responsible in space. China notes the announcement of the United States not to do more tests of destructive anti-satellite missiles. We congratulate you on any initiative to master the weapons contributing to the Paris. and we are against the expansion of a military advantage in the name of the mastery of armaments. The American Initiative does not mention the development of production and the use of these weapons, and does not mention the activities that threaten or disturb normal operations, so it is completely insufficient to solve problems in space. The range... of the PPWT text and goes much further. It offers effective solutions to safety in space, in particular. We ask the country to stop using excuses to block negotiations on a treaty on the arms race in Spain. We must respect and guarantee that countries have the same right to the peaceful use of space, by emphasizing the interests of developing countries and new space powers, by promoting cooperation and technical assistance at peaceful ends, by delivering peace dividends to others, and promoting development... economic and social development thanks to space. We must fight against sanctions, lift barriers, avoid... to abuse the concept of threat. I would also like to discuss the participation of commercial companies in military space activities. In some countries, these companies participate in military activities, which has accelerated the expansion of weapons in space. Yesterday morning, American professor David Koplow from Georgetown University cited Article 6 of the OST. China also considers that the country must leave its obligations and have regulatory responsibilities by managing and controlling commercial activities in space to avoid accidents and behaviors that can aggravate confrontation. Countries must also ask commercial enterprises to use orbital resources. to not question the right of developing countries to peaceful use. We support the UN as the main framework of international space governance to ensure that established rules are complete, inclusive, just, with as broad a participation as possible, based on consensus, without imposing the will of some on others. There are priorities that require coordination and cooperation that must be reinforced to which includes a more detailed presentation of the proposal and the positions of China on the subject. We invite you to look at this document that was published on the Secretariat's website. My team and I are trying to act and get involved in the work of this group in the most positive way possible. We have taken good notes from the comments of the other speakers. We will try to work with all of you to define effective ways to respond to the threat of security in space and to contribute to peace and lasting security in space. Thank you, Mr. President.",4
S1M352,1,3,President,I thank the Chinese ambassador for his intervention. for their constructive support for the group's work. We will start the session for a well deserved lunch. We will meet at 3pm. The first to arrive on the list for the general exchange of views will be the Brazil delegation. The session is over.,2
S1M42,1,4,Brazil,"I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Helmut Lagos, on your presidential election as president of the Dutch Open Workers' Party. for the sake of the security and sustainability of the outer space. President, we are very concerned about the importance of the outer space. The satellites have become the main components of most of the underground and the main sources of the earth and space. They have increased the importance of our societies and economies in many activities such as international communications, in that. The international location system has become a key element in many economic sectors, and it has become the most prominent and important component in the work space, in terms of the ability to transform the outer space into the and the future of the world. I think that the future of the world is not just about the future of the world. It is about the future of the world. And I think that the future of the world is not just about the future of the world. It is about the future of the world. And I think that the future of the world is not just about the future of the world. It is about the future of the world. And I think that the future of the world is not just about the future of the world. It is about the future of the world. And I think that the future of the world is not just about the future of the world. The International Space Agreement of 1967 represents our main mission to establish and maintain the stability of the space. The Foreign Ministry has made significant progress in reducing the risk of danger related to the safety of the space program. We have also made significant progress in reducing the risk of danger related to the safety of the space program. the security side, we have made some progress, especially through the support of the United Nations Workers' Union, the recommendations of the 23rd team of experts on the process of building trust and transparency. Unfortunately, our efforts to reach the goal of negotiating on the part of the law that the And on this basis, the working team represents this opportunity to be more careful in order to reach the goal through a path from the bottom to the top and through working on the ground. and of the behavior that we consider responsible, irresponsible and threatened. In general, the lack of transparency and the lack of appropriate reporting of space activities leads to a bad interpretation and a conflict of potential. and the ability to interpret and share information about it, and to contribute to transparency and trust. There is also the issue of irresponsible and threatening behavior. We believe that the highest working team can handle this issue. the RPO's operations without prior warning and without approval. Such activities result in less suspicion and lack of confidence, and may lead to countermeasures by non-meaning countries. We also have the ability to intervene in satelite systems, especially in cases that lead to loss of a permanent job and the threat of space security. and the threat of security and sustainability in the outside world. Here, we are recording with all due respect the announcement of the United States' comment on the tests of the counter-terrorist weapons to destroy the missiles. This is the first step. It appears that it will include other types of similar weapons. And Brazil believes that time is up to prepare all the destructive and anti-missile tests. and the I hope that this is a key step in developing the international space system. I want to give the floor to the representative of Mexico.",0
S1M43,1,4,Mexico,"Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to be here. I congratulate you on your choice as president of this working team. I congratulate you on your good administration for our business. which allowed us to sail in these challenges and the and The increased awareness in space activities and also the increased awareness in daily life confirm once again the need to focus and emphasize on the fundamental and global principles that have been thrown into ensuring the use of space for peaceful purposes only in the light of a safe and stable environment. And considering that the outer space is important for many activities, as we have heard from many of the UFOs, and for the purpose of fulfilling the goals of sustainable development, the outer space becomes an important strategic area, and also a destination. to increase tensions between the different parties. And then, it should take measures to prevent any conflicts that could lead to security problems in space and on Earth, and it could also bring a serious consequences on humanity altogether. And then, we welcome the establishment of this working team that should always aim to decide to use... foreign space should always be for peaceful purposes, and for the benefit of all countries, and based on the principles of cooperation and exchange of the most important, we consider the importance of foreign space to the full scientific and technological. We must ensure that foreign space represents a safe and stable environment. and on that basis, we are continuing to find attempts by the Mexican Foreign Forces to confirm the importance of banning and under international supervision, all weapons of total destruction should be brought to the country and removed regardless of the class of these weapons or their places. And then we will refuse to place any form of these weapons in the outer space. Any activity in the outer space should be open to the benefit of all, for peaceful purposes, and in recognition of the principles that belong to all humans. The outer space treaty defines this as a global partnership, because it puts... in considering the effects of these weapons and the benefits of the outer space for future generations. This is an important comparison in order to preserve the safety of the outer space. Another issue is cooperation. We must save... ..the stolen weapons or, pardon me, we must not save any weapons for the situation of the weapons and... the control of any country in the outer space, or the control or control of any country in the outer space, will create problems in the outer space and in the land, as well as that it can make the outer space a place for confrontation. If we can divide our proximity to the outer space, we must look at preventing the pre-armament in the outer space and make it an area for the use of weapons and weapons alone. We must think about the deep links between civil and military use for the outer space. and then it is important to understand the impact between the two approaches and work on the implementation of cooperation and coordination and at the same time we must admit that it is necessary to avoid any marriage work we must be sure of our agreements and not repeat work. and they use it as well, or leave a space that affects the earth and mankind, and it could be a reason for any armed race. And furthermore, the United Nations announcement that the United Nations made that it will not conduct any destructive tests will not conduct any destructive tests with the destroyed And also, we do not see that any other conducts or other capabilities in the agreement are acceptable. Mr. President, the risks in the foreign space are diverse and complex, and we cannot cover them only by taking measures. We must understand the risks in a comprehensive way. We must understand every danger, every challenge, and how to interact with these dangers in a way that we can understand what are the available tools to solve the problem. In this case, the necessary rules are the law. The presence of threats will be difficult to know unless there are international agreements and then there are some elements that can be identified in our team. First, for international security. Ayyuuu Tanveer the security of another country can affect its enemies even if it was a project, whether it was an attack on the enemy, or there is no transparency in what is known as exchange of information about the external space, it can be seen as a threat to it, even if it is not a intention or an enemy intention. And then, the transparency is important to build trust. Thirdly, we must... We need to take a systematic approach to this. We should not use this approach to the extent of uncertainty. We should not hesitate to make special recommendations on the outer space, or to prepare the space resources, or to focus on the outer connections. The main principle of the laws of space is not only to oppose the laws of space, but it also increases the perceptions of threats and leads to the preservation of responses that may lead to a fifth wave of our view of different texts or forms of threats, including electronic wars, cyber attacks, and other attacks. The technology is used to look at space and to make large-scale threats. Security in outer space is a big threat to humanity. and then we need to ensure the compliance of the voluntary and mandatory measures in order to respond in a consistent manner. My final priority is to ensure that the Mexican opposition is understood. to progress gradually in the work of our team. We must avoid the close contact that is caused by the mandatory treatment. In our country, we see that this treatment is far from the other. Therefore, the treatment related to the responsible behavior that should be completed and we are ready to put our weapons in the outer space. Finally, we want to confirm with Mr. President that we need to enhance the possibility of participating in the civil society organizations in our projects. Thank you.",4

We have saved a number of points and the limit of risks, transparency and trust after these principles. It is not possible to carry out any activity that may lead to a And we have also confirmed the need for non-experimental tests in space. And the contribution we have made to complete the current international law and the special guidance for countries in which we are required to go to outer space and use this global framework that can be established from the non-responsible behaviors in outer space. The important behavior of the person responsible for the safety of the space is the necessary stability in the space. The space should also be placed for the safety of the space. Respect security and safety of different parties, and the and the security of space bodies. We are also looking at the map in a way that is similar to other countries and we are considering the opinions of the international standards that apply to the activities of outer space. This process is to help deepen the common understanding and to achieve the agreement of the standards or principles and the laws related to outer space in order to strengthen the security of space. We confirm that the international law, including the United Nations, and that the countries should comply with its obligations in accordance with the international law in order to safeguard international security and peace, and for this reason, it is important to strengthen international cooperation and international understanding and we have also fully complied with our international agreements. Foreign Affairs Council is the core of the international legal framework that organizes foreign affairs and foreign affairs activities. I think it is important that countries exchange their national opinions in order to reach an agreement with terms such as the Jurega, which are also found in international agreements. will be able to continue its space activities with the necessary attention to other countries. This includes developing operational directions to support the existing roads. The development of the law is a cumulative process and can be developed through the consultation The law is not going to be implemented. The other obligations related to the previous countries in the outer space, the President, the coordination of the negotiations between the countries in accordance with the international law, is something that should be enhanced. This is also important, and we have it. Wara da fee. in the 36 to 2 material of the basic Rome system.

S1M47,1,4,Iran,"Thank you, Mr. President. In this occasion, I would like to congratulate you on taking over the leadership of this open-ended working team, as we thank the members of the discussion panel today. The Islamic Republic of Iran confirms its position that the external space is the and the international community. And the exploration and use of foreign resources must be for the benefit of all countries or nations, and foreign resources must be a field for international peace and cooperation. Mr. President, the international security, economic development and prosperity of countries depend more on foreign countries. These two similar directions have become more common, and that is to implement the protection of foreign countries and to implement protection of foreign countries from the effects of of the political agenda. We must also distinguish between the responsible and non-responsible behavior in the external space. This will strengthen the agenda of the work of the United Nations. the arms release conference and the general arms release agenda. The distance from the Parisian government, which is engaged in negotiating on a legal basis for full and successful implementation, to prevent the arms race in the outer space, to be completed by the use of space and peaceful items in a balanced and non-discriminatory way, has become more critical, so that we should not waste time on the way to the afterlife in negative discussions or in the opposite results that come from more parties. Mr. President, the understanding of the officials' behavior must be an attractive political initiative, but it is to be able to the only country in the world that has been able to use the space in a safe manner. The space military is one of the most challenging in the 21st century as a result of the resistance of the non-governmental countries that are insisting on the irresponsible behavior that develop their space military programs. There have been more than 100 tests against the will be more effective in responding to the space race compared to the law of the second world war that the outer space must be protected and that it must be the biggest work for humanity. And it must be committed to the and the war. The United States is developing military forces and military operations to excel in the advanced military technologies of the outer space. These actions are threats to the outer space and its security, and the sources of conflict and conflict lead to more arms and military forces of the outer space. Mr. President, the balance of power between the countries, and its benefits, is that all is a fundamental principle in international law. In light of this principle in international law, how can a country or a group of countries be a to and will continue to follow its footsteps. This description of space activities is unacceptable. And in the absence of a law that is required, the intraday and the non-reliable and unjust policies that prevent other countries from operating in peace in the outer space. At the same time, this process has damaged the exchange of trust and the ability of developing countries to benefit from new space opportunities for economic and social development. Mr. President, the ban on the The security of the space is important. We must use it in a peaceful manner. We must implement the law. The main priority is to implement the plan to bring down the international weapons. The space must not become a new field for competition between the major powers or competition. The security of space is different from another principle. The security of space is related to the arms or the and the root causes of space weapons are represented in some countries that seek to... to achieve a unilateral superiority in space. And the safety of space is related to the risks associated with the explosion in the space routes that countries face when they carry out space activities. And then these two matters are different and we must deal with them separately. And in this context... the need to ban the banning of arms in the external space in the arms trade conference in the nearest future. The President's approach to building trust and transparency may be clear and reliable, but it cannot prevent the banning of arms in the external space from being legalized. to end your life easily. Foreign summit must play an essential role in preventing an armed race in the outer space. Other parties, such as the Fourth Committee and the First Committee in the General Assembly, and the Kopioss team, must be summit. We, with the 21st Group, in the arms summit, have presented an agreement that relates to the In 2018-2019, we had a discussion about this. The team failed to verify the report that was signed by a state. But there were deep discussions about elements that should be legal regarding the banning of the arms race in the Paris space. This was based on negotiations for the arms trade agreement. and the decision of the General Assembly of 75, 86, or 76, 231 was made in agreement by many countries, including the technology in the space sector, voted or refused to vote on this decision, and this indicates that this decision is further away from our goal of the Prophet. the Islamic State is completely opposing the arms and military forces of space. Our position is that the exploration and use of outer space must aim to strengthen economic and social development for all countries in order to improve the human rights of the space. or the confrontation in the Gulf, you must prevent the security of the space for the sake of peaceful things. Finally, Mr. President, from the mission in place of all countries, including the countries that voted against the decision, the opportunity is given to the Arabs to express their opinions and positions, and then... to listen to its concerns and reflect on the final report of this working team.

And if there is enough enforcement, it will also contribute to the and the United Nations. and in the case of the use of armed forces, we have to consider the existence of three consequences, first, indiscriminate, and second, respect for the standards of the international law for defending the project against the soul. any defense against the same attack, any armed conflict or armed attack, and also the prohibition of the principle of reconciliation. Third, the peaceful solution to the disputes. The document also indicates the implementation of the international law, as I mentioned, in France. You fully recognize the implementation of this law in space, but sometimes it does not and we are ready to work with our team to ensure that the international law is implemented. and the international space law. When we look at the goals of our team, we will find that the team relies on the principles of the international space law to ensure the freedom of exploration, exploration of space and its use in a peaceful way, which is what is translated as the implementation of the peaceful use of space. to their space in the area of one of the agreements of 1967, as well as in what concerns the responsibility of the countries which are also included as a guarantee for the conduct of the officials. We also focused on two numbers of comments. This morning we talked about the issue of registration. Goodbye, my dear. I ask the leaders of the countries to make the decision. I thank the President. I thank the representative of France for her intervention. I wonder what if there were more requests to speak in this phase. I see a representative of a cup of a I thank the French government for its important observations regarding some very important issues. I would like to focus on some of the main elements that were discussed during the official and unofficial discussions, and I would also like to highlight these points in our official meetings. and that is what is happening now. I think that the discussion is clear about the definition of the law of the known, about the use of force or the threat of the use of force, which applies to any field or region other than outer space and space bodies, and I do not object to that. However, there are some opinions that said that it is not clear. how we can describe some activities that some people consider activities specifically or using force. Secondly, outer space witnessed cases The non-translational, Romantic, for example, in the Bn Taki statement, applies the main principles that are actually in the international law. Third, in some of these virtual situations, which we can see non-organic behaviors, for example, some may consider that an activity or behavior that is not taken care of by a country or a country that has been affected by this or that. In this respect, the damage that is done by other countries, we need clarity on how to any harm. This might be useful in the future for this team, with the help of international law experts to evaluate this issue in my opinion, if international law applies to some external activities, and also the legal responsibility system that applies to these activities, and which also includes the support of my leaders in what they achieve. in the light of what is happening, I think it is clear to us that it is necessary to strengthen the focus of the team's work on the current legal framework. We will not see that in the program. But I hope that in the future we will look at these issues because the definition of the laws that are in place will help us define the activities that are not subject to the organization. And so we will focus on this in our future work. In addition to determining the gaps and the gaps I pointed out, we must focus on another important point. France has applied a second system for any non-proliferation projects in countries. and other activities such as non-responsive behavior in outer space. So, analysis and the view on how long these non-responsive behaviors will help us. on what steps and what measures are responsible and irresponsible. This leads us to a legal discussion that we should discuss with experts if we invite them to our team. Also, when we talk about responsible and irresponsible behavior, this directly connects with the actions that countries recognize. So, if the behavior of a certain state is in violation of international law and the behavior of the person in charge, we must then determine how to use the sign to this responsibility in the international market and the international mechanisms. If these mechanisms are in place, will they be created later in the future? We also have to see. This is a matter of tools. We should consider it as a separate matter. We see that the tools in the framework of the law of the seas and oceans represent a model that is being used. to use the principles of peace for the outer space and for the benefit of humanity. It is also true that France has pointed to the freedom of use of space. And so, but there is also a principle that all these activities should benefit everyone and not be based on the interests of a country with its own interests and benefits. There are official and unofficial meetings, so it can be very useful. If we define the factors related to the different forms of behavior, it will be necessary to evaluate these activities and determine how to implement them in a legal system and determine the tools that are used to implement or monitor these responsible behaviors. The difference between the steps that lead to the responsible behavior and any treaty that judges that is Thank you. I present to you the representative of the United States of America, the word Sayyidi. I'll just turn the United States. The Foreign Ministry has been working on the international legal framework that applies to foreign activities. This agreement has been involved in the exploration of foreign countries and using it through a wide range of parties to serve the needs of humanity on Earth. This agreement includes the basic principles of organizing foreign countries' activities that have been targeted by the UN, the UN. The United Nations has agreed to the international law on the release of arms. the security of the countries and the use of countries for the sake of foreign peace and the necessity of the supervision of countries for the interests of other countries in their experience before they can organize any activities that may lead to the entry of the countries in the activities of other countries. any weapons of mass destruction in the Earth's orbit, or to spread them in any other way in the outer space, and the outer space and the main space, will not be used for any technological activities or space capabilities in a detailed way. That's all. and to preserve the continuity of the treaty and these treaties, and to serve an important role in the outer space. It is not an attempt to answer all questions or to leave any specific activity, but on the contrary, it is an attempt to make more than half of the world a framework that can cooperate with the countries of the parties in order to bring about the capabilities and the resources that are in place in the outer space. And in this, we have to know about the government tools and... The rules and principles of the responsible behavior have been developed in this framework of the United Nations Directive. And also the principles of directing the lightening of the external forces. The first speaker from the University of Al-Ama in Al-Qar 76 on 31 confirms that my experience in these regions is the great mark that has achieved great progress and great results on the ground. Thank you, the United States of America for its intervention. And now I give the floor to the representative. to the representative of the United Kingdom, the words I am giving you.",4
S1M422,1,4,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Mr. DeRis, and thank you for this opportunity to comment on this second topic, which is the excellent presentation we heard this morning, and which caused a lot of discussion in the unofficial sessions. I hope we can think about it this week. I will start by confirming what we said. the United Kingdom in the framework of international law. I think the matter is clear. The international law applies to the distribution of countries in and in contact with the external space and the current legal framework, including the United States and the international national identity law and a set of constitutional laws, including the external space and others, which is clearly indicated. to strengthen this group of laws around foreign exchange. It is related to the timing of the countries and the confirmation of the agreement of foreign exchange and will be a good example of that in order to strengthen the existing system. As well as and we understand that the regime includes the law of arms which applies to all operations in space that are carried out in the field of enemy operations or conflicts. There are a number of laws that are applied in special circumstances and not in a safe state, which we will discuss. We will discuss this matter tomorrow. I would like to make two remarks in light of the discussions and the presentations we heard this morning. The first remark is that in all our discussions this morning and in our discussions about how the existing laws are, we talked about the business, behavior and activities of countries, not the capabilities. Professor Wayne spoke about the role of behavior, activities, and work in this discussion. So, work and behavior come first, then abilities come second. and not the first or the fundamental consideration in determining whether it is a legal or non-legal activity in conjunction with the international decision. The second observation is that I think that in my discussions this morning we heard some discussions that were mixed between the responsible and the irresponsible, with the legal and non-legal behavior in other areas. to show the slight differences in opinions in this discussion. Not only the scenario that Professor Wayne has set out, where we will discuss the threats and scenarios that he has set out, But from the legal perspective regarding international law, it is clear from the scenarios that some of these scenarios deny international law and some do not deny international law. I do not think that there is anyone here who listens to these scenarios that do not... the So, from our point of view, this category of activities and behaviors that do not meet the standards of armed conflict in international law, but are not... or not wanted or the international security forces, and it is the focus of this team's discussions. This is the problem that we have to face as a group. And now, as we heard this morning, the question is, if we have to determine the behaviors that are within this group, what is the question? What will we do? There have been discussions over the years, whether the legal process is the most convincing or the other processes are the best way to overcome this. And I am confident in my country. He sees that there are many activities and behaviors in this legal field. The difficulty of determining from the legal point of view, and this is due to the ambiguity or the non-objective or non-objective nature of it, for example, the concept of threat or even the lack of clarity of the intention, and then the issue of the intention or the goal, and then there must be more clarification, as Professor Wayne said. Now, we have to do this in the long run. We heard that some of these issues are complicated and need to be addressed, and we may be prepared to achieve these behaviors from the legal point of view or to define them. The last point of view or the last aspect of these observations is the escalation. to the issue of self-regulation, as Professor Wayne said, and I think it is a collective task. How do we define the collective self-regulation in this field, and how do we define or minimize the issue of self-regulation? And for me, this is a step in the expertise of this team, and today's lectures were useful in this prayer.",2
S1M424,1,4,Cuba,"Thank you, Mr. President. I apologize for the interruption, but I have a point of criticism. I think that the work in the field of the General Assembly's Fundamental System makes us too busy in our interactions and we stay in the subject of discussion. And the issue of accusations and the lack of information about the spaces does not concern the discussions that are taking place here. And then I ask you... to address this issue. and the Russian Union, please. Can you close your doors? No, we didn't hear the translation. Is there a problem with the translation? We are using the right to respond to the project in light of the dangerous accusations that were made by one of the refugees. The reason why we started military operations in Ukraine is that since 2014, the regime in Kiev has been attacking peaceful citizens in Donbass. Those who did not accept the military coup. that there is a constant struggle for the attention of the Nazi forces in the Ukrainian government. And also the killing of peaceful citizens in the south-east. Mr. President, I object. This is a matter that is beyond my right to respond. This is a matter that is beyond my mission of this meeting. I am grateful to you for stopping my entry into Russia. I ask you, ladies, to close your meeting and remind you that the practice of the response must be in the end. The word is still there and the word is still in use. Mr. President, there was no other request for the speech. We have decided to use the right to respond after your permission. I have finished my statement. I would like to urge everyone to remove the political line from the intervention or the non-political intervention. I understand that the WFOD has instructions and I cannot... I'm forced to follow what the WFOD says, but I try to encourage the WFOD to move to the rules. We would like to ask you to focus on the topic we are discussing today. This is my invitation to all the speakers. If we start talking about this crisis and wasting our precious time, we will not be able to make any progress today. We are trying our best until this moment. So we are calling for corruption. This is my best advice for the deaf. I understand that there are certain instructions that the deaf receive, but let's try to... We will do our best to do so in a limited way. and we do not take advantage of the time we need to implement the ambitious task that the General Assembly has entrusted us with. Maybe it's a mistake to conclude what we've done now, despite the recent interference. We will continue our work tomorrow. We will conclude our work today. Tomorrow we will start at 10 a.m. with the unofficial episode about the third topic, the protection of civilians and civil goals. There is an additional request for the word. from Pakistan. Thank you for listening to the series. I do not want to keep you waiting. I have some ideas about the previous discussions about the morning discussion episode. After the ideas that some colleagues in the hall said, I have some remarks on behalf of my country which may be useful to our discussions. After your permission, I would like to proceed with that. Go ahead. We have had a very interesting discussion and we have also had a very good conversation and we have talked about the first two things, the behavior and the second, the abilities. And again, we have heard about these The second observation is that some behaviors are connected to some abilities or types of abilities and ideas. Any abilities that are developed and spread or may be used. The third observation is that some behaviors have been developed and spread. will be a result of responding, responding or calling in some way or another with some capabilities. You are giving us these three observations, to which there is a logical question. Is developing, spreading, and threatening using some abilities to form an irresponsible behavior? And I believe that this question needs... to a direct answer. The idea of capabilities cannot be denied, regardless of how they are approached when we talk about security issues in the foreign region. And then these issues are also discussed and left to us as part of our work, while we try to... How can we understand the general attitude and our relationship with security in the foreign space, and then the issue of preventing the arms race or the arms race in the foreign space? Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the representative of Pakistan Al Muqar for his intervention and for pointing out the issue that is being discussed on the website today. Are there any questions? President, I think that the resources and the Samina. And unfortunately, I think that we have not... I would like to speak to the United Kingdom's foreign minister. and from the legal point of view. So the problem is that and we will continue to speak about the responsible and non-responsible behavior of countries. In my opinion, there is a and in Canada. the the court. and The issue is that for many years, the law has been established. This is the state law. or it is not necessary to define the mistakes or the damages. We must define the international standard that is connected to the issue. I agree with the United Kingdom in what it is related to. and to or I see it possible for this team to suggest the solution. And I apologize for repeating myself again, but I think the discussion is in effect. will be useful to use the remaining time, as you have advised us, as a right.",2
S1M426,1,4,Australia,"The Australian Thank you, dear President. I will speak about Ukraine to ensure that the countries present in our conference today will have the opportunity to participate in our work in order to continue the discussion in a constructive way. I would like to share my thoughts on this. A very important issue, which is represented by the Argentinians. I refer to the fixes that we use in our discussions. The data we heard about include different terms, dangers, threats, choices, and so on. We should be clear about what we are talking about. We believe that there are two types of dangers and dangers that differ from the warnings. The dangers and dangers in outer space come... of space activities that countries do and in accordance with space legislation. Space the existence of space objects in circles We also witnessed cases of separation of the satellites from the satellites in an unusual way, in addition to space satellites due to the case of launch of the space rocket. All of this comes from space activities, and there are dangers that are connected to the nature of space, considering it a specific field for human activity, and from that threats of radiation and radiation. weather, weather changes, etc. All of this affects the capacity of outer space. All of these issues are discussed by the committee of the use of the name of outer space, KOPOS VIVIANA. We must clearly distinguish between these dangers and dangers. The same is true between the threats. The threats related to the arms race in the outer space and the weapons situation in the outer space. Because these threats have a specific nature and features, they are linked to the international military activities in the outer space and are directly linked to the implementation of the... and military plans in the outer space, and as a result, it is also linked to the growth of military strengthening in the outer space, military strengthening that can be used against space objects. So we have to be completely clear about what we are talking about. When we were talking about setting different rules and standards for the responsible behavior in the outer space, when they called to prevent the pre-armament race in the outer space, then we had to understand the terms we used. We are talking about threats related to the activities of the outer space by countries in the outer space. And now, our experts... They have an understanding of the threats that are in the outer space. The threats do not come from space. The threats depend on gradual accumulation. They occur gradually. There are various types of threats related to the activities of the outer space when one country, for example, and start planning and building certain capabilities for the purposes of a specific military eye and they can achieve that with non-military targets as well. This planning can target both military and non-military eyes, and plans to build the military forces in the outer space. The next stage is the transition from the dangers to the dangers. When these capabilities are created, but there are still some flaws in the operation of these capabilities. Here, military experts talk about the existence of capabilities and the dangers of using these capabilities. And finally, when threats are made in the The situation in the foreign countries means that the military power, the offensive power that can be used at any time of the time, if we witness it now, is a direct threat by using this power. In our discussions, we have to reach a clear conclusion. If we were to point out the first category of dangers and dangers related to human activities in the outer space, or related to the nature of the outer space, considering it a specific and specific field for the activities of countries. or we talk about the dangers of the military activities in space. This distinction is important to understand the terms of peace and security in the first case when we talk about the dangers and dangers of space activities and space exploration. and also related to outer space considering it a special field for the and how to prevent any incidents or related accidents. It requires some procedures and tools to organize these accidents. When we talk about military threats, we must use the term military security. It is related to using offensive capabilities. The term military forces is a sign of the German forces' destruction or destruction of space bodies of other countries. This is an important point for the purpose. We should pay attention to it in our discussions. What we are talking about in our discussions. And here in this hall, as I see, we are trying to prepare and discuss recommendations related to standards and rules of the responsible behavior. directly to prevent the armed race in the outer space. Therefore, we should focus on the second category of threats. The second category is threats that show a certain development and that we are talking about military threats in the case of when we talk about security, we should talk about military security. This is important when we are publishing weapons in outer space. For the first group of dangers, let's leave it to the Committee for Peaceful Work of the Outer Space, COOPUS, to focus on this group and also other work groups, including the space I'm a very noble, a very noble person. There is also a team here to handle the responsible behavior. The team is to ensure the preservation of space resources. All these issues should be dealt with in these conferences, the conferences that were created under the Koppos wing. And here we should focus on preventing the spread of weapons in the foreign space, and preventing the pre-weaponization of the foreign space and the responsible forces, This is a dangerous task, and it should always be in the focus of our discussions. That is why I am holding on to it. As I mentioned before, any kind of space confrontation will be a burden not only for the German countries, but also for the countries that are in the space. This speed can extend from outer space to Earth and not be limited to space If we look at this situation, it is a fight that takes place on Earth will remain limited to the Earth, even if it gets support from space. These are my initial comments, and I would like to share them with you.",4
S1M429,1,4,Canada,"Shukra Sayyid al-Rais. We have heard signs in the past about the damage and the provision of compensation for the damages. As long as we talk about the compensation, we can talk about that, because that may solve the problem that has affected some of the nations. There are also notes about the importance of joining the Foreign Trade Agreement. We can look at the seventh part of this agreement and the second and third and fourth parts of the responsibility agreement related to compensation for harm and harm. These provisions indicate that the absolute state of affairs is responsible for the goals that bear responsibility for the right of harm. In the responsible agreements, there are details that are included in the obligations compared to the external budget. There are also absolute responsibilities related to the damages that are inflicted on the ground or even the issue of the tyrant. There are also the matters of the agreements that indicate, but do not explain what is called, what can be explained as a mistake. Uh... We must also determine what are the acceptable and reasonable standards for countries when they are practicing space activities. This will help you specifically when the country fails to meet the standards or when it causes a mistake. shay'a or the sawat al awwariya. And then you can go back to these agreements. If you are not a member or a member of these agreements or agreements, because this is a serious matter. And the second point is that you contact What France said about the use of space weapons, I don't want to pressure anyone. We will use them to give an example. Some capabilities, for example, are used in a variety of ways. But how can we use, for example, the weapons of Canada, Canada Arm, which has been used for years and I trust and hope that the countries will not consider it a weapon? But when it was there, some countries were afraid of that because there may be consequences for the black market and so on. But as the decades go by... the question is, how do we use the capabilities that do not reveal any threat? This is not a threat to international security and peace. This is an example of using a useful tool that can be used for other purposes. For example, the behavior of the person in charge helps us to determine what if the person in charge is a threat. If you use the way of the person in charge, that supports security and peace. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. So, from our point of view, this is the most important thing that the team should do, to look at the behavior of the officials and others, even if we are faced with international security and peace through shared understanding. And if we think about the foreign space, I think that they are calling for the signing of such discussions and the use of the foreign space for the benefit of the countries, and what is the most important thing is to consider the obligation. This is the issue that we must discuss in this team. Thank you.",2
S1M431,1,4,Japan,"Please go ahead, Mr. President. For the security, security and threats that the Russians have affected, yes, there is indeed... There are many mistakes related to the separation of the two matters. There is also the issue of defining the dangers, or threats. This requires more discussions. But from the perspective of Japan, from the difficult point of view, the separation... between the issue of security and security, and the two issues of security and security, and to define what is the military threat in reality. Because there is an increase in the number of countries, or the number of countries that enter the space and activity and also the mixed nature of these activities right now. And then, Japan. and the United Nations has submitted a paper to the UN and it is submitted. For example, the establishment of a new UN I thank the Japanese representative for his intervention. There are two people who want to speak. We will end this discussion later. It is about 6 o'clock. Three students. Please don't worry. We have to finish our work at 6 o'clock. I'm a Tehadis Taliya, Russian Union.",2
S1M432,1,4,Russia,"This is Al-Karim Sayyidi. Thank you very much. I want to respond to the comments of our friends from France. First of all, any space or space device will be contaminated by outer space, because as a result of any operation, there is space debris. I would like to ask you about the general destruction of space objects that lead to... time to the father This is Amron, the committee of the space activities and the public sector. This is for you. We're talking the same. The question is that any body of space has a mixed nature in its use. And we are against this interpretation, or we are against this interpretation, and I will give you the reasons. First of all, This contradicts the goal of the use of peace for the outer space. The nature of the state of space technologies is naturally mixed in its use, but it can be bought in accordance with the international law to ensure that there is a special space exploration of peace goals. Some missiles can be used as weapons. This is a theoretical matter, but in terms of the process, it is different. And if we agree with the interpretation that our friends from France have given us, that any space object can be used as a weapon, then... We have to realize that there are 3,500 dangerous spaces in the outer space. And military equipment may be used at any time to target or attack targets in the outer space or on the ground. So what is suggested is a different interpretation of what is happening in the outer space. the countries in the outer space in the past two years since the beginning of the exploration of space. We are not talking here about the satellite satellites that are launched by the military institutions and the This is a dangerous idea, because it forces us to accept that we must respond or respond to the attacks of these weapons, and then we will have a new interpretation of space activities that countries are doing in accordance with the international space law.",4
S1M434,1,4,Cuba,"Thank you, Mr. President. It is time to close the meeting. We will now discuss the terms and the same issues. We have tried to identify the risks and the options in our national paper that the Secretary General presented last year. I have indicated here that our government sees any activity to destroy or strengthen the space resources must be determined or considered a threat. This is our position and this is our definition of threats. It is the basis of our approach. It is difficult to determine the purpose. and then we must be the way to focus on behavior, and this is what we are doing in this team. As we see, the path related to the legal and peaceful use of space must be followed in Vienna. We must focus here on the security and threats of space and the behavior of those in charge here. Thank you. which represent I would like to end the meeting for a long time. I have two points. First, I would like to use the mixed and the definition. I would like to point out to the panelists that any technology is limited and that it is used in a mixed manner. Another issue, and this should not be neglected, is that... In this meeting, I understood that the issue of discrimination is being discussed during negotiations, and I think that this is one of the reasons for this discussion and the memorandum. I understand that there are issues that cannot be resolved through just banning The arms race in space has been pointed out that people can use other seats. The issue raised by the UN is that it is an imaginary to deal with other space issues. Is this a sufficient or not? This is a general example. The question raised by the UN is how to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This is due to the lack of discussion on other issues related to the capabilities in outer space. How do we receive the laser capabilities in space? And how do we address this issue of diversity? The issue of weapons is a matter of capabilities. The other justification is that another angle is a matter of importance and without... The question is, if space is used to support the capabilities of other places, for example, to increase the capabilities of other weapons, where does this lead us? So, the discussion should look at these capabilities, and I accept that countries cannot provide a reliable system, and the armed forces are not well-prepared for the country's well-being. and I will now give the floor to Mr. President.",4
S1M62,1,6,Finland,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Finland associates itself with the EU statement and presents the following remarks in its national capacity. But firstly, I would like to warmly congratulate you, Mr. Chair, for the assumption of your role. I am confident that under your able and positive leadership, this open-ended working group will be able to achieve substantive... and tangible results. You can be assured of our full support. Finland welcomes all international efforts and commitments to address security challenges and responsible behaviours relating to outer space and to reduce the risk of misunderstandings and miscalculations with respect to outer space activities. due to irresponsible behaviors. Mr. Chair, Finland is a firm believer of respect for international law and the multilateral system. Russia's unprovoked and unjustified act of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the UN Charter, and undermines international peace, security and stability. Mr. Chair, we are looking forward to addressing the space security and threats aspects under the UN disarmament instances. We also welcome the important work done in KOPOS and its adoption of the long term sustainability guidelines. We see these two work strains as mutually reinforcing. I would like to thank all the experts that are contributing to our discussions this week and providing a wide range of written contributions. It shows that the question on threats in space is not only a concern for state actors, but also to a multitude of stakeholders including academia, civil society, international organizations and the private sector. Finland firmly believes that fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships will be instrumental in strengthening security in a multi-layered domain such as outer space. We consider outer space a global commons for the benefit of all, and hold the view that all space activities should be carried out with the highest standards of due diligence, and fully respecting the security, safety and integrity of space objects and avoidance of debris. With increasing congestion in space, the risk of misunderstandings and miscalculations leading to unintended escalation is rising. At the same time, Earth-based actions and actions in the cyber domain can directly affect systems in space, impairing critical space-based services. These interactions only highlight that enhanced efforts to address space security are thus called for. In view of the complexity of space as a domain and the inherently dual use nature of space systems, we see a behaviour based approach as a pragmatic and fruitful way forward. Establishing norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour in space as proposed would serve the purpose of preventing misunderstandings and miscalculation. and thus reducing the risk of unintended escalation. This would be a first step to mitigate threats in space, and complementary to further possible legislative work, building on the already existing rich legal framework of which the Outer Space Treaty is the cornerstone. To conclude, I would like to add that there is an urgent need for improving and strengthening information exchange transparency and confidence building in the space domain, and improve situational awareness. We believe that this week's open-ended working group meeting will also contribute to these efforts. At least, I feel that the high level of interventions and experts have given further understanding on the various concerns at hand, as well as national views. and we look forward to participating actively to the work of this working group. Thank you.",1
S1M64,1,6,Venezuela,"Thank you very much, Chairman. On behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and its government, we congratulate you on having taken up the chairmanship of this open-ended working group, and we commend you for all of the work that you're doing in your stewardship. In Venezuela, we believe outer space is a common asset for the whole of humanity and we must make sure there is fair and equal access without discrimination to all nations so that it can be used on the basis of international cooperation in issues such as scientific research and technology transfer. One of the platforms for international cooperation in space activities is the commission on the use of outer space for peaceful means and its scientific and technical commissions, as well as the assistance provided by the Office for Outer Space Affairs. There is permanent participation, constructed participation of all countries. So this is essential. in order to defend national interests. Our country also believes that geostationary orbit is a limited natural resource which is exposed to saturation and which therefore must be used on the basis of principle of fair and rational use by all countries, particularly bearing in mind the needs and requests of developing countries. even if a country has the right to participate in exploration and use of outer space, then this same state, this space must simply be used for peaceful means because we need to ensure the development and survival of all nations, any state, regardless of their state of development and in line with international law. must not abuse of celestial bodies, including the moon. Our country has a cooperation agreement with the People's Republic of China for the peaceful use of outer space in order to develop technologies which will assist with social development for the Venezuelan Republic. Chairman, the treaty on the governing the conduct of states in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, the treaty which the outer space treaty of 1967 prohibits placing nuclear weapons or any other kind of weapon of mass destruction in outer space. And it prohibits placing them on celestial bodies. either. It also lays down the basic principles relating to the peaceful use of outer space. This means that exploration and use of outer space must occur for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and the moon and other celestial bodies cannot be appropriated in terms of sovereignty by any country. Venezuela reiterates the need for outer space which is safe, free from threat, which is stable. We must prevent this becoming an area of conflict. We reiterate the need for all states to scrupulously respect the principle of non-militarization of outer space. States must abstain from any actions or activities using outer space to place or deploy weapons of any kind. The triggering of an arms race in outer space would represent a very great threat to international peace and security. And this is something the international community must prevent by negotiating a new international agreement, which should be a binding agreement, which complies with the principles of verification amongst others. establishing outer space as the common heritage of humanity, which prevents its exploitation for Bellico's reasons. There needs to be a legally binding document in the short term. For this reason, a working group must be established within the conference on disarmament. It should be a working group on Paros, the prevention of the arms race in outer space. and this should be part of negotiations on disarmament. We believe that the draft treaty proposed by the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of Chimna on the prohibition of placing weapons in outer space and relating to the threats posed by objects in outer space should be considered by all states. Chairman, we express our concern... at the development by some states of spy satellites and the use of satellites to intercept communications. These are activities which go against the principle of the peaceful use of outer space and they violate the principle of the sovereignty of states. In this respect we would launch an appeal to all states to ensure that the use of outer space and exploration of space should be peaceful activities. and that there should be promotion of activities within the context of sustainable development. The exploitation and use of outer space must occur purely for peaceful means and for the benefit of all countries, regardless of their level of economic and social development and undermining no state. We regret that scientific and technological advance and progress achieved. in outer space could be distorted and used for national missile defence systems or other military uses. This is something which could trigger an arms race, particularly if we bear in mind that the legal framework applicable to outer space is not currently a sufficient guarantee that this space will not be militarised. So this is something that needs strengthening. in considering outer spades as an asset belonging to all of humanity as a common heritage. States should step back from placing any offensive or defensive military activity in outer space, and there should be the provision of reliable information on all activities in this area. In September 2015, our government made a statement together with the government of the Russian stating that their two countries would not be the first to place weapons in outer space and also that all efforts would be made to ensure that outer space would not become a theatre for military conflict and to ensure the safety of space activity. We echo those voices that believe that priorities should be reducing space debris. We have to ensure... that space capacity for developing countries is not limited and that this doesn't become a real burden for their space activities. Chairman, the issue of security and safety in outer space is a very complex issue. Responsible conduct in outer space, the interpretation of this can become overly simplified and... be used in a politicized fashion. We need to develop rules and norms for responsible behavior and this must be considered as a step towards a legally binding agreement. As an intermediate step, it's important to adopt measures, transparency and confidence building measures in relation to outer space activities. and this is part of peacekeeping and maintaining security pursuant to the UN Charter. And this is something which could really contribute to safety in outer space. The adoption of such measures by states is an urgent step to strengthen existing rules and norms, and this can contribute to making activities in outer space safer in the short term. It should also support international efforts to adopt a legally binding document. But there can be no replacement. to negotiating a legally binding document preventing an arms race in outer space including the prohibition of placing any weapon in space. This also includes threats and particularly relating to objects in space. You can ensure the support of our delegation in concluding our work successfully. Thank you.",4
S1M67,1,6,Netherlands,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for giving me the floor. And let me start by thanking the panelists again for this fruitful debate we had this morning. I think it's very useful to focus our minds to what we need to discuss and what we need to think about here. I would like to make a few comments related to that presentation and in view of the topics discussed. I think we should make a distinction between the yas in bello and the yas at belem. Space just as the earth should be used for peaceful purposes. An armed attack or an act of aggression is prohibited on earth as in outer space. This however does not render a discussion on the conduct of hostilities irrelevant. The question of whether resort to weapons, yas at belem, is different from whether the and the behavior of the parties to a conflict is lawful as such. The particularities of the conduct of states in outer space, the inherently dual use of many space capabilities, and the threats emanating from irresponsible behavior, especially in this fragile space environment, only underscore the importance of looking at behavior and the intentions of states very closely. While we're here not to rewrite IHL, The discussion on the application of IHL to the behavior of states in outer space is very useful and I want to thank again the speakers for their contribution in this respect for this morning. The principles of IHL mentioned by the speakers are highly relevant for assessing the lawfulness of the conduct of states in outer space and my government would fully support this. We want to add one more word of caution. I know that lawyers are... I'm happy to do that, but I do think we should avoid getting mired in questions of definition. Defining activities is essential for assessing whether they are lawful or unlawful, but it's behavior which we should be looking at. Thank you.",2
S1M69,1,6,China,"Thank you. China has listened attentively to the in-depth statements of keynote speakers under this item. And we'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for the contributions. These statements, as well as the discussion after that, have made it further clear that that weaponization in outer space, the arms race in outer space, and the use or threat of use of force in outer space might bring about humanitarian damage. With the technological advance and socioeconomic development, mankind's reliance on outer space has reached an unprecedented level. And such tendency will continue and will further accelerate. as for the use of force in outer space. What is at stake is definitely not just the one or two pieces of space assets which might be damaged. Instead, it might cause the snowball effect and lead to humanitarian disaster. The party who provoked the war in outer space cannot be immune to it as well. This reminds us once again. of the danger of de-weaponization in outer space. The wars in outer space cannot win and cannot be fought. Should be the motto for all countries and all state holders that must be kept in mind and complied at all times. The wars in outer space cannot be fought. Also, due to the inherent vulnerability of the outer space environment. Once the conflict breaks out in outer space, the lowest orbit space will suffer from fundamental, even irreversible damage. The peaceful activities in outer space will be difficult to continue, and all efforts aiming at improving the space environment and reducing the debris will be in vain. Mr. Chairperson, China also would like to stress... that OEWG should also focus on the work conducted in perils instead of deviating from it. Relevant work must serve the prevention of weaponization in outer space. The reason why we stress this point is that during the discussions in the three days, from time to time we hear some views that the law of armed conflict, the principles of prevention, proportion and distinction should be applicable to outer space. These fields, whether or not intentionally, from an objective perspective are actually making the rules of engagement for the arms conflict in outer space, which is equivalent to an acquiescence that outer space is a battlefield or could be a territory for conflict. China cannot agree with these views and we believe many countries at present may have similar concerns. China would like to reiterate that although militarization of outer space has become a reality, yet the prevention of weaponization outer space is possible to achieve and must be achieved. Given the security situation in outer space, to start, the negotiation on international legally binding instruments on prevention of weaponization outer space allows us no delay. It will only be meaningful if we stick to the general objective of negotiating and concluding the treaty on arms control in outer space. And based on this objective, we discuss and explore the responsible behaviors in outer space. The letter cannot be used to delay or even replace the negotiation of the treaty on outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chairperson.",4
S1M611,1,6,United States,"Distinguished Chair, thank you for the opportunity to make some remarks this afternoon as we continue these important discussions. Over the course of the past several days' discussions on norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior, there have been a number of countries that have expressed support for the U.S. commitment not to conduct destructive direct-descent anti-satellite missile tests. The United States greatly welcomes these statements of support for what we believe is an important first step. and reducing the risks to the outer space environment, while also increasing trust among states. The United States looks forward to working with others to determine how best to multilateralize this commitment. We believe this commitment is an important step because as Professor Wong discussed yesterday, no treaty prohibits the testing of this type of anti-satellite weapon, nor is this type of testing prohibited by any current arms control proposals. The draft treaty on the prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space only purports to prohibit the threat or use of force when it comes to terrestrially based weapons. Nowhere does it prohibit the development, testing, or deployment of these ground-based weapons. I also regret that some colleagues doubt the strength of our commitment. The U.S. has considered such commitments for a number of years, and it has become clear to nearly all those who depend upon space, that the ongoing use and long-term sustainability of the space environment is critically endangered by the increasing amount of destructive testing of direct-descent anti-satellite missiles. As Dr. Steer mentioned this morning, making these types of commitments, including them in strategies and doctrines, could be an important step to limiting this threatening action. And so I would welcome further discussions to address any concerns about this. This commitment is also not about impeding the ability to conduct peaceful uses of outer space. The language was chosen precisely to avoid restrictions on the debris that is created during routine space operations, such as during launch. Those activities are covered by the widely accepted debris mitigation guidelines. Instead, we are focused on the security aspect of the action. The destruction of a satellite orbiting the Earth. caused by the launching of a missile from the ground, air or sea, which has been demonstrated to be the most pressing threat to all countries' use of space. As discussed this morning, we cannot predict the future potential for collisions with this debris. Satellites are already being forced to essentially dodge or duck the debris from the most recent what will happen months and years from now. And we agree with calls that we should not limit ourselves to this one commitment. And that is precisely why we are here. This is a first step, and we welcome substantial discussions on other norms, rules, and principles over the course of this open-ended working group. But nonetheless, we believe it is an important first step that can demonstrate progress by the international community. The United States also recalls that history has shown that commitments like this can form the basis for future arms control agreements, though it is also shown that such negotiations take time. The evolution of the provisions contained in Article 4 of the Outer Space Treaty provides an excellent example of how commitments by countries can be transformed by action in the UN and eventually incorporated into an international agreement. The path to the Outer Space Treaty began in 1960 at what was then known as the Ten Nation Disarmament Committee and also later that year at the UN General Assembly when the United States proposed an agreement on prohibiting the placing or station in outer space of weapons of mass destruction. Following several years of discussions bilaterally and in the 10 nation disarmament committee, on September 19th, 1963, Soviet foreign minister Gromyko told the general assembly that the Soviet Union wished to conclude an agreement banning the orbiting of objects carrying nuclear weapons. In order to demonstrate momentum on this issue, less than a month later, by October 17th, 1963, the general assembly unanimously adopted a resolution welcoming the Soviet and U.S. statements and calling upon all states to refrain from introducing weapons of mass destruction into outer space. This resolution, along with the declaration of legal principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space adopted later that same year, would go on to form the basis for the main provisions of the Outer Space Treaty. though it took several years to complete negotiations on that treaty, which entered into force in October 1967. That example shows why we should recognize that diplomacy takes time and that jumping straight to negotiations of a legally binding instrument without the work to develop norms, rules or principles will all but guarantee that our efforts remain at an impasse. That is why we believe the most pragmatic way to demonstrate progress. is to identify measures we can take now to reduce the risk of damaging the outer space environment, reduce the potential for misunderstanding, misperceptions and miscalculations, and to increase trust among member states, which is critical to progress on this important issue. And it is through this OEWG's inclusive process that we can make progress on these issues, including advancing other ideas for norms of behavior. that can make progress regarding security risks and threats in space. As such, we welcome others' views, others to review our commitment not to conduct destructive direct descent anti-satellite missile tests, and to join us in taking this first step towards ensuring the safety, security, stability, and long-term sustainability of the outer space environment. Thank you.",0
S1M613,1,6,Portugal,"Thank you very much Mr. Chair for giving me the floor. I was going to return to the fruitful discussions we had this morning and my delegation would like to make a general comment on the applicability of international humanitarian law. and say that IHL establishes norms that are applicable also during peacetime, not only during wartime. There are positive obligations on states that usually relate to conduct of preventive measures, for example, the protection of emblems and the protection of cultural heritage. And in this sense, I would like to underline that there's a very important example of IHL obligation applicable during peacetime that is the obligation to disseminate IHL and to have an accurate dissemination of IHL states need to know and not only how IHL applies but also how it applies to new means or methods of warfare, and how we can have a transparent dialogue regarding possible interpretation of IHL, especially in the face of new phenomena, such space activities. And we agree that this is a subject on which this open-ended working group can really play a very crucial role. So, us here coming together and looking into this complicated questions as the ones that were raised this morning. And as I mentioned in, I think it was Monday, We have a national defence strategy for space in Portugal, 2020-2030, and we think that this is a good example of a responsible strategy, not responsible in the notion that would be understood by a jurist, but in the more... general way. We think it's a good example of responsible behaviour. So the whole view of this strategy is very much... to give support to the general space strategy. So the armed forces act here as a multiplier of the general civilian strategy. And it's very much focused on how the armed forces can provide protection for civilian and civilian infrastructure, civilian objects, with the non-military use of space. So I already mentioned this strategy on Monday. At this point there is not an English translation available but the Portuguese version is already online and I invite you all to check this strategy and to see how it is that Portugal is proposing a very active role for the armed forces, relating also to the general strategy on space. Thank you.",2
S1M615,1,6,Cuba,"Thank you, Chairman. We thank you for convening a group of eminent experts for this substantive session, which has been most fruitful as we have seen. We have some comments that we would like to share with those present. Firstly, on the basis of the scenarios set forth, It would appear that we are faced with a scenario of imminent conflict in outer space, and with that in mind we wish to reiterate the value and importance of an international commitment not to place arms in outer space. Cuba has already shoulder this commitment and we urge all other delegations to do likewise. We are greatly struck by the extrapolations of existing IHL. that we have heard today, particularly when it comes to the provisions under additional protocol one, we are convinced that the delegations here present will agree that outer space should only be used for peaceful ends in line with the... relevant international principles and we feel therefore that the most important thing is to move towards codification of this peaceful use so that we can avoid any of the scenarios that have been mentioned today coming to into effect there needs to be an approach that can do away with potential conflict. as was clearly pointed out yesterday by Professor Wang, we need to be watchful when it comes to discussing the applicability of the right to legitimate defence and IHL, which should not have any raison d'etre in the absence of conflict. We should not be, albeit indirectly, opening the door to the use of force in space. This should be reflected only in terms of legal norms, as is the case in the draft Russia-China treaty, for which we reiterate our support. The time that we're giving over to these potential conflict scenarios should be used for further work on Paris, so that we can avoid such threats coming to pass. it has become clear from our discussions that there is great concern. We need to tap into that concern and come up with meaningful, binding results. Cuba has put on the table a number of very relevant questions for discussion, and we hope that this OpenID working group can give over time for those, such as, for example, the issue of responsibility. the need for international cooperation in a more effective way, and the list goes on. We hope that due attention will be given to this and that a fruitful debate can take place on them. I thank you.",2
S1M617,1,6,Brazil,"Thank you very much, Chair. I don't have a formal statement on this agenda item, but I'd like to... perhaps share a few thoughts on the issue of protection of civilians, since this has elicited some positions which are not necessarily in line with our views on the subject, and perhaps we'd like to offer an alternative view, and in particular when it comes to applicability of IHL to the possibility of space conflict and space. to all realms of warfare. And in our perception, the experience demonstrates clearly that international humanitarian law makes warfare less likely, not more, for a very simple reason, because it constrains the options, at least the legitimate ones, available to parties to a conflict. And it's a bit confusing to hear. that international humanitarian law doesn't apply to space because warfare should not occur to space, and that's certainly something that my country fully espouses, that space should remain an arena for peaceful activities, not for warfare. But to hear that being said while many states are developing and testing weapons for use in outer space and against space objects is a bit confounding. There's a reality emerging. to duck our heads in the sand or to actually work actively to prevent the reality of conflict in space a reality at the first place and if it comes to occur to ensure that the options available to parties in warfare are extremely limited at least the legitimate ones as I said before and this is a discussion that we had that length in the both in the GGE and the And it's frankly a very frustrating discussion because it is clear that in both cases IHL is a source of law as it is for any sort of warfare. And it is also a useful guidance, it contains useful guiding principles that can orient the behavior of states both in peacetime and in warfare. So at this point I would just like to signal this perception, our perception in this regard. I have some other comments but I just wanted to focus on that at this moment. I might take the floor later. Thank you very much, chair.",2
S1M619,1,6,France,"Mr. Chairman, I would also like to come back to the issue of the applicability of international humanitarian law. As France sees it, the applicability of IHL to space is absolutely essential. France recognizes the full application or applicability of IHL in space. I have of course listened carefully to what was said by my colleague from China and I am somewhat surprised by those remarks because the applicability of IHL to space absolutely does not mean that we are accepting the notion of conflict in space. We are surprised to hear some delegations indicating the view that the threat of force or resort to force may extend to space. And if this is not possible, then IHL would not be relevant. Such a link would be a retrograde step and an unprecedented weakening of the whole corpus of international humanitarian law. of the 1967 treaty provides that activities of states should be carried out pursuant to international law. Refusing or denying the applicability of IHL to space would therefore be tantamount to a violation of the 1967 Space Treaty. Therefore, as we see it, the issue is clear-cut. IHL applies. And that is not tantamount to accepting the notion of conflict in space. On the contrary, we would do our utmost to avoid such a situation. I think that is why we find ourselves here today endeavouring to put in place rules for responsible behaviours to avoid miscalculations and avoid the risk of escalation. I would also like to dwell on another area of discussion that took place yesterday since, and to clarify position, since yesterday I took the floor to evoke the impossibility of defining a weapon in space. I think there might have been some misunderstanding, and I would like to make myself crystal clear here in reaction to my statement delivered yesterday, the Russian Federation, if I may say so. adopted a somewhat absurd line of reasoning suggesting that any launching of a satellite would be tantamount to placing a weapon in space. That is certainly not what we were trying to say. I would note, moreover, that Ms. Cassandra Steer, the panellist this morning, herself evoked the difficulty of defining a weapon in space. I would like to clarify that what I was trying to say was that any object could be used as a weapon. In other words, any object could be used for hostile or threatening purposes. That means that if we prohibit certain capabilities, states will therefore use other objects to give rise to the same effects. and that is particularly true in space where technological development is rapid. On the other hand, if we prohibit an effect rather than the capability, for example, if we prohibit the destruction of satellites giving rise to debris, or if we prohibit scrambling or interference if that could give rise to fatalities on the earth be the civilian or military here we are prohibiting an effect. Technological developments would not enable any reversal of that achievement and we would be avoiding any way of bypassing this rule by using one means instead of another. Prohibiting the means, it is possible to skirt around the prohibitions, but if we prohibit the effect, we avoid such possibilities. And we avoid the possibility of technological development annulling our efforts here. I hope my position is now clearer and that we will avoid any further misinterpretation. I thank you.",2
S1M621,1,6,Italy,"Thank you very much Mr. Chairperson. Indeed, this is a very rich and interesting discussion. And also, we didn't plan to take the floor on this, but since the discussion is really important, I believe for the aim of the Open-ended Working Group, there are a couple of comments that I would like to make. And well, first, I believe that my distinguished colleague, especially of Brazil and France, life very easy because it was about the legal framework and the applicability of international law and international humanitarian law in outer space. Because of course our position is very clear on that, but there is a point that I would like to underline. And that in any case we believe that it's really strange to think that a rules-based system and more rules and a more regulated framework should cause an armed conflict. This is really a connection that we cannot see. case in history where the adoption of rules has made the situation worse honestly and the applicability of a regulation should contribute to avoid such situations and not to cause them. And really we don't see this kind of connection and it's one that we really would like to avoid. We understand that there is a concern that the concern is that the simple acceptance of the could lead to the notion that armed conflicts could be conducted in outer space. But this is absolutely not our aim here. And when we talk about the legal framework, in any case, we think that this is not the idea. The idea is to contribute to a more secure and safer environment in the outer space. There is another maybe more general point that I would like to underline because I've heard, listening very carefully to this debate, I've heard a lot of comments about how this, the work we are conducting in the open-ended working group is in a way in competition or even in conflict with the work that we do under the Paros agenda, DCD or in other fora. And honestly, that's another issue that I would like to clarify. at least to explain our view about this. Because the idea, the whole idea of the Open-ended Working Group is to reach a common understanding on how best to act to reduce threats to space systems in order to maintain outer space as a peaceful, safe, stable environment. free from an arms race and free from conflict. So in a way, it's part of a broader effort to prevent the arms race in other space. And the two exercises are conducted in different instances, in different fora, and in a way can be complementary. And since I happen to be also representative of my country to the Conference on Disarmament, I recall your intervention a few months ago, if I'm correct, to the Substance Abuse Body 3, where we discussed PAROs. And I believe it was very constructive and reached the discussion and the Conference on Disarmament. In a way, these are processes that we can... consider, that we can participate in together and hopefully they will contribute to the one to each other. We really believe and we hope that the work that we are conducting here will contribute to define norms in the end. And I believe that there are already steps in this direction. Some states have announced commitments and I believe that the commitment announced by the United States is one that goes in the right direction and that we welcome very much. But this is something that we can all consider and in a way is a step in maximizing the chances of a successful outcome for any future negotiation, even for a binding treaty if we agree in the end.",1
S1M622,1,6,Austria,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you Mr. Chair for giving me the floor. Let me start, there's other colleagues now that before me by stating that Austrian position is that international humanitarian law applies without reservation in outer space. IHL is part of international law which according to Article 3 of the Outer Space Treaty fully applies to all activities in the use of outer space. We follow here the argumentation of the ICRC which was outlined in their excellent working paper and in today's presentation. Article 9 of the Auto Space Treatment Act. Hello? Sorry? Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty establishes that space operations have to be conducted with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other state parties and therefore establishes the protection of space objects in outer space. But in cases of conflict, the principles of IHL apply fully. In this regard, distinction, proportionality and precaution of attacks are essential and must be fully observed. Similarly, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population have to be protected during military operations, also in outer space. In our view, the OEWG can contribute in creating a better understanding of what kind of outer space systems fall under this category. As discussed on previous days of this session, the issue of dual use and a clear segregation of civilian and military uses and capabilities is one of the main challenges in relation to this topic. other soft skill attacks on space objects. In the context at hand, the impact of such attacks on civilians on earth is the same, no matter the nature of the attack. At the same time, we need to have certain accountability. And this is an aspect that is more difficult as experience in the area of cyber security has shown in previous years. Furthermore, the notion of attacking this context in outer space where objects might be disabled without... direct damage to the space object itself merits further and in-depth discussion. We are pleased that the impact on the natural environment is mentioned in the title of our topical discussion today. Many delegations and Under-Secretary Nakamitsu have underlined the importance of space technology for the SDGs and for climate action. Here we also want to refer to the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, which specifically refer to outer space. point made by Mr. Steer this morning, as well as the ICRC, is the application of the law of neutrality in outer space. It might be no surprise that Austria is of the position that the law of neutrality must be observed under any circumstances, be it on Earth or in outer space. Thank you.",4
S1M625,1,6,Russia,"Thank you, Chairman. We would like to draw attention to the statement delivered by the French delegation today, the distinguished French representative. recalled the statement of the Russian delegation yesterday, at least as I heard through the interpretation, suggesting that what we said was an absurd line of reasoning to the effect that any launch of a space object could be considered as potentially a weapon in orbit. Yesterday the Russian delegation did not say such a thing. We were saying that any launch of a space device Could in some form begin to be space debris and I wanted to make that very clear at this point. Thank you Chair.",2
S1M627,1,6,Brazil,"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for giving me the floor again. I would like to offer a simple, a few ideas on the issue of definition of weapons, which is something we have been discussing over the course of this week. My delegation is not of a single mind in terms of what approach would work best in this regard. Many ideas have been floated around in the years in which we've been discussing. the topic of Paris in the GGE on Paris as well. But I think that the idea that was advanced yesterday by our expert speaker from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is extremely promising in terms of what we could examine over the course of this OEWG, not necessarily for drafting a treaty, but I think it could be a guiding concept for our efforts responsible behavior is. And I refer specifically to the idea of defining weapons not by their internal characteristics, but by their effects, how they are used. It's a sort of a ex post facto definition. And it's very similar to the approach that has been followed by other instruments in the international security and arms control arena. I recall, for example, that the Chemical Weapons Convention defines as a chemical weapon any toxic chemical that is used as such. And the definition of toxic chemical, if you talk to a scientist, can be extremely, extremely Alcohol can be a toxic chemical depending on the quantities and circumstances it is used. Chlorine, for example, is a toxic chemical that is not defined as a CW edge agent by the CWC and its annexes, but it can and has been used as a weapon. So I think that a similar approach here could be extremely useful and I think would perhaps reconcile these differing viewpoints that have been marring our progress in this field for so long. Thank you.",2
S1M629,1,6,Algeria,"Thank you, Mr. President. Please allow me, as a participant in this interactive discussion, the builders, to make a point of importance regarding the legal and standard rules that apply to the outer space. Can you hear me? Can you hear the English channel? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wish to take part in this constructive dialogue regarding the rules and norms that applies to outer space. We believe that the application of IHL and international law, including the UN Charter, the IHL, we have to look at the same time at the problematics of the international applying such rules under the current circumstances and in order to clarify all concepts. All controversial issues have been presented in the report of Outer Space Commission on Paris. That is why. with regard to the norms and rules can be viewed from different angles, which necessitate some codification and laying down a legal framework for its use in outer space. So we have to be quite balanced in this approach. ranging from negotiations on legally binding principles and some other non-binding texts. However, this will not replace the legally binding issues. And that is why this open-ended working group should take into account all the different situations and not to take one sole approach that will not seek common understanding. As we said on Monday, we have to understand and to find complementarity in order to prevent arms race in outer space. And the responsible behavior by states in outer space in order to have the positive impact on the conference of disarmament in order to achieve our main objective, the sustainability and the use of outer space away from armed conflicts. I thank you, sir.",4
S1M631,1,6,Russia,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to share some reflections. as a result of the last two days of discussion. in view of our delegation. With the execution of certain points, we have had a business-like constructive and result-based discussion. I would like to express gratitude to you, Mr Chair, for the wise way in which you have led our discussions and the organisation of the work of the session. I would now like to address some substantive issues. At the outset I would like to draw attention to the fact that at this time... There are two trends that can be distinguished, two approaches to resolving the issue of the prevention of lums raised in outer space, which have been adopted by states. The first I would dub the traditional approach, couched in the conceptual approach to space activity contained in contemporary space law, which in turn is couched in the UN Charter. The basis of the traditional approach is the principle of use of space for peaceful ends and the refusal to ensure that it can be partitioned off by individual states. or to undermine security or cooperation internationally. as well as the principle of minimizing environmental damage or potential damage. the principle of space activity in the interest of all other states, and particularly important, the peaceful settlement of disputes. All of these principles have been... were designed by the international community at the time of maximum tension between two powers and they reflect a general understanding by UN member states of the exclusively peaceful nature of activities in space and of space itself as an area absent of conflict. and a place for international cooperation in the international community to the good of all without exception. In addition, these principles, deriving from articles 2, 3, 4 and 9 of the 1967 treaty, directly make reference to the unacceptability of making use of exploration of space for the benefit of one state or group of states, the exclusion of others. we draw attention to the fact that the 1967 Space Treaty and the Convention on Harm provide for peaceful means of resolving incidents and resolving disputes. all of this together with the prohibition on certain forms of activities in space. attest to the fact that the international community has agreed on the goals of space-based activity. and specifically... and non acceptance of any military like activities in space. which offer the potential, serious potential, for conflict both in space and on Earth. In order to achieve these goals, the international community, at the 10th special session of the UN General Assembly, sets itself the challenge of achieving PAROS, and defines the approach and principles to addressing this task. Russia has been a consistent proponent of this traditional approach and this is at the root of our initiative on the potential treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of threat or use of force against outer space objects and the NFP initiative. If we address the issue of applicability of IHL to space in the current circumstances on which it seems that consensus has already been achieved. This means that we should continue to consider the issue of regulating space activity, including the task of PAROS on the basis of the traditional approach. which was put in place already 60 years ago or so. This requires us to deal with certain gaps in space law. I can't await to this traditional approach. is a different interpretation of space and of space activity. In essence, we would tend to agree that the, in exploring space the peaceful nature of space has already been reaffirmed. And now... According to those opponents, it would appear that there is now the possibility for rivalry in space and the inevitability of potential conflict. This potential rivalry between the powers and the use of space as an arena for potential military action is fleshed out in such an approach. This approach logically raises questions about space-based activity and its regulation. It's an issue of space regulation being transferred to considerations in relation to global security. And in turn, this place on the agenda questions such as the applicability of IHL to space, interpretation of certain acts or lack thereof as a priori harmful. Hostile. and the legality or not of military acts in space, and the applicability or legitimacy of the right to self-defense in space, and other issues that have already been mentioned by the delegations in the room. Therefore, it would appear that in view of the risk of threats, to ensure the security of space and security as a whole, there is a need to consider the issue as a whole in order to better prepare for potential armed conflict in space, according to this approach. This is approach which Russia is categorically opposed to. we consider that there is still time on the basis of the principles of international space law. and the approach to space acts enshrined therein to come up with recommendations for Paros. On the basis of the initiative on responsible behaviours in space, at the basis of that is the notion of a prohibition of certain behaviours that would enable guarantee of normal operation of space objects, devices, property and infrastructure and its support mechanisms. This is a notion which deserves further attention. But the proponents of this initiative, for some reason, are opposed to the definition of the launch of weapons in space and the placement of objects in near-Earth orbit. which would be nationally an irresponsible behaviour in space. I draw attention to the fact that such actions taken by certain states or groups of states are run counter to the principles of peaceful use. building of security as well as development and cooperation and peaceful settlement disputes. taking into account the interests of all states. In addition, placement of weapons in space would be direct evidence of willingness to use them. in conditions where... not all parties necessarily have analogous possibilities. meaning that this would be a direct threat regardless of the actual purpose of the placement of the object in space. Here I would draw a direct historical analogy. in 1945. the US designed and then used nuclear weapons. The unilateral mastery of those weapons posed a threat to the security of other states, and it's their use. albeit against a state with which they are engaged in warfare, was not only a demonstration of military potential. and supremacy, but also a threat of force to potential opponents. The Russian Federation is opposed to the repetition of such a scenario in space. However, with a high degree of likelihood, one can predict that the launch of objects into space will increase the likelihood of their potential use. I would like to note that Russia and China, by tabling the PPWT draft, of the placement of weapons in outer space, are proposing a simple and effective solution to eradicate this threat. is Article 4 of the 1967 treaty. And it's fully in line with both the traditional approach to regulation of space activity and the principle of prevention of force or threat of force in space. here, but make reference to the universal lecture of article 15.1 of the UN Charter. This is something which is quite clear to see and cannot be doubted. However, I would draw colleagues' attention to Article 2 of the Moon Treaty. Article 3, the interpreter apologies. Sub-Optical 2 of Article 3 of the Moon Treaty. which affirms this key pounding principle of international relations. directly in relation to space objects. In our view, the authors of this treaty fully acknowledge the difficulty of interpretation of interpreting space activities as harmful or harmless, responsible or irresponsible. and therefore this principle of the UN Charter should be specifically projected into space activities. In so doing, it would be possible to ensure that space could be kept free of harmful activity. I would recall that this approach is used in article two of the draft Russia China PPWT. it is of concern that there are attempts to frame the debate in terms of the right to self-defense and also attempts to ensure that to justify certain harmful actions in the in relation to the act of other states. I would recall with regards to this topic. that space has always been and should remain free of conflict and those involved in space activity are obliged to respect such principles as insurance international law and international space law. In other words, not to cause harm to space objects of others. Therefore, in essence, international space law. firms that activities in space cannot begin to be harmful and they are not intended to cause harm to space objects and any instance in space should not serve as grounds for triggering self-defense pursuant to the relevant article of the UN Charter. I would like to note that in and of itself, the very raise of the issue of the right to self-defense in space. is an invitation to increasing potential or military potential in space and also for the preparation of plans for its implementation. even more potentially worrisome is the point raised by Korea with regards to the right to self-defense and the potential of large-scale harm. This concept fails to heed the content of Article 51 of the Charter with regard to the conditions for availing oneself of this right. If one were to adopt such an interpretation, a new interpretation of the right to self-defense, then we would be... taking steps along a very dangerous path. In conclusion, the situation is as follows. Firstly, the concept of responsible behavior in space. is in many ways analogous to other actions in terms of regulating space activity as adopted by state in the UN outer space committee. Secondly, in terms of the way and on the basis of which this is carried out. This approach is not necessarily in a position to ensure that paros can be achieved. Third, in essence... potential preparation for military action in space and also the understanding of space as an arena for harmful actions between one state and another and military action is possible. So far in this session I've only heard two clear-cut definitions of responsible behaviour. The first is unconditional observance of international space law. which colleagues indicated served as a framework for so-called responsible behaviour. And secondly, the willingness to begin negotiations on a legally binding instrument that would contain reliable guarantees as to the preservation of space from the placement of weapons in space. and prevent it thereby from becoming an arena for military conflict. separately the issue of the applicability of IHL has been raised. And I would repeat that currently, pursuant to international law and international space law, outer space and near space and low orbits, as well as heavenly bodies around the earth, are zones of peaceful use and investigation and exploitation for purely peaceful ends. Therefore, reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law, overall. and in terms of certain provisions thereof. are premature, I would say. it would be certainly sensible to address this topic where military potential to increase in space if weapons were to be placed in space. and when it can be seen that states are willing to make use of that potential against both space and terrestrial objects. Until then, I must repeat. Discussing the applicability of IHL is premature. I would like to draw attention to address the experts. In the course of the meeting of this group, an extensive discussion took place as to the applicability or not of international humanitarian law. many ideas were expressed. although it was not possible or it was not clear that there was an obvious shared approach. reference was made into alia to the possibility of applicability of Article 36 of the Optional Protocols of Geneva Convention of 1947. on legal reviews. in terms of IHL. But that article would not be applicable for two reasons. The first is that at the current time, nobody is developing weapons for placement in outer space. I hope, at least, that nobody's doing so. undertaking a legal review of space technology on the basis of potential double use of space technology. is not merited. with regard to other provisions of International Space Law. the use of certain categories of conventional weapons and the applicability of IHL provisions such as proportionality. All of this is premature, as I said. And I recommend not touching this issue in the course of this session or future sessions for the time being. Of the, in sessions of the open-ended working group. Thank you for your attention. For the time being, this was all I had to say. Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his intervention. And I would like to know whether there are any other delegations I would like to make use of the floor. Yes, the distinguished representative of the United States. You have the floor, sir.",4
S1M632,1,6,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the opportunity to once again address this body. I wanted to follow up a bit on the comments the Russian colleagues made, especially those related to the United States. I have listened closely to the comments of my colleague who joined us in the Paris GGE about how the Russian Federation views the international security environment. In his comments about the United States, he talked about the United States having a military potential which I understand is quite significant. I would be very curious to understand more from him about how he views ground-launched anti-satellite missiles and whether he views testing of those as a demonstration of a risk, a danger, or a threat. In particular, I take note that he is the Russian Federation's desire that space should remain free of conflict. I think that is an important issue for discussion here. But I would take note that when Russia conducted their anti-satellite test last year, and his Russian colleague, when they talked about the reasons for doing this anti-satellite test, was to increase the defensive capabilities of the Russian Federation. And so in that respect, I would welcome Russia's views on Since you have begun development of a capability, you have demonstrated a capability to destroy a satellite, do you believe that international humanitarian law would apply to the use of such a system should you need to use it in self-defense in the future? Because I think that's one of the key questions that I have regarding our work here. is how do we cover these ground-launched missiles that many countries appear to be developing? And also I'd like to point to our Russian colleagues that we believe we are taking the traditional approach to the development of these issues related to both norms and legally binding arms control. My colleague has cited SST-01. I'd like to point everyone to the final report of the ad hoc committee on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, which concluded in 1994. This was the result of SSOD1 tasking the conference on disarmament to look at the issue of Peros. I'd like to point out that its task is to identify issues relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space. And certainly I believe the prevention of conflict in outer space is relevant to that discussion. And I'd also like to read from that report about the summary of the discussions they had. in this first session of the Conference on Disarmament, recognizing that many of us were not here at the Conference on Disarmament in 1994. It says, quote, during the annual session, in the course of the debates, as well as in the open-ended consultations, the attention of the committee was drawn to the issues of the adequacy of the current legal regime, confidence-building measures in outer space activities, and terminological aspects of the work of the committee. So it seems to me that the history of this issue has long incorporated these issues related to norms of behavior and transparency and confidence building measures, and not just a singular focus on an arms",2
S1M634,1,6,Russia,"I would like to thank my U.S. colleague for his remarks. We stand ready to provide a response with regard to the Russian Federation's activities in space and the test in November last year. That said, I should note... that our test is nothing out of the ordinary. Such tests were carried out by the US in the 1990s. using kinetic means and also... means and systems on the basis of other physical principles, for example, with the use of laser systems. In addition, the United States has for a long time had in place anti-satellite potential, terrestrial potential of such a nature. This potential includes They misspell interception system, as demonstrated in 2008, where an intercept system of the US destroyed its own satellite that had gone into an uncontrolled orbit. with regard to the purposes or aims behind the development of anti-satellite potential or capability, they may be manifold. They may be peaceful. For example, the only way of preventing a an out-of-control orbiting satellite from colliding with other satellites or falling onto some crucial infrastructure on Earth may be its destruction. In addition... many states, European states for example. are considering the possibility of developing such potential in order to protect themselves against meteor falls on earth, large meteors. and sp- with an example being the metro at the Faluncia Lubińsk. This is something which nobody could oppose. In addition, with regard to other purposes for using this type of potential, I would draw attention to the fact that many delegations of western states have actively been referencing the potential double use of space technology. the use of space devices and objects as weapons. This is a topic that we have warned our colleagues about on a number of occasions. this approach to specialization in space devices. is, if you will, an invitation to the development of counter potential. And here I would diverge from the point of view of colleagues who say that we can't draw a clear line between civilian and military-purposed objects. you could do that on the basis of the registration of objects, for example. the Russian Federation has been a proponent and continues to be of this type of guiding principles. within the relevant working group of the UN Space Committee. In addition... I should mention the experience we have from the nucleus sphere. it is undeniable that all nuclear technology can potentially be military. That said, the international community has found a solution that enables quite a clear definition or distinction to be drawn between civilian nuclear technology and objects and military ones. Could we not consider going down that path? My last point with regard to anti-satellite potential. Then I should say... that the Russian Federation is an initiator of a treaty. on the PPWT. Thank you, sir. Article 2 of that treaty. clearly indicates that all obligations should, there should be clear obligations with regard to prevention of threat of force or use of force in outer space. Consequently, this obligation. Given that space is to be understood as a zone free of conflict... the absence of weapons in space. is a hurdle or hindrance to development of development and accumulation of such potential. I will end my comments in response to my distinguished US colleagues at that point. Naturally, we will have other comments on which we would like to take the floor in reaction to what has been said by other colleagues in the course of discussion. Thank you.",0
S1M636,1,6,Korea,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. No need for apologies. Since my country's name was mentioned, I was obliged to take the floor, but I promise to keep my remarks limited to that for now. Maybe my statement yesterday was overly lengthy, so this could have caused misunderstanding, and I apologize if that was the case. But the Republic of Korea referred to self-defense in the context of conditions of justification, or rather circumstances precluding wrongfulness, and cited self-defense as one of those elements that could be considered along with emergency and self-help. when we were discussing the use of force or the threat of use of force in space. The ROK has pointed out that we might need to also consider and review whether these circumstances, precluding wrongfulness, should be reviewed when we are discussing about the use of force. Now, so I wanted to clarify that, and I regret that Russian Federation has misunderstood our remarks yesterday. But at the same time, I would like to conclude by welcoming Russia's remark that it has no intention to develop or deploy weapons in space. Thank you very much.",2
S1M638,1,6,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to add one more comment. I hope we can continue this important conversation, especially about the applicability of international humanitarian law. Our Russian colleague is correct. In the past, the United States has conducted anti-satellite weapons tests. Obviously, we have our new commitment where we pledge not to do that in the future. We also believe very strongly that international law... and especially international humanitarian law, applies to outer space. But I do want everyone to understand that our commitment does not cover a meteor coming to threatening the Earth. We have longstanding cooperation with the Russians in how to defend against such an activity. Our commitment is about destroying satellites. An object coming towards the Earth is not actually in orbit around the planet, and I think we can all agree that having a capability to defend the planet against imminent mass destruction is something that the international community should continue to work on. Thank you.",2
S1M640,1,6,Portugal,"Thank you for giving us the floor again, Mr. Chen. I'm sorry to take the floor a second time. But as the debate has been quite interactive and we definitely welcome this format, I will abuse my colleagues' patience. Some delegations have been mentioning not only the use in Bello, but the use at Bello too. So we're a bit coming back to yesterday's topic, but... I would like to point out that the chart of the United Nations is definitely our north star, especially Article 2, Paragraph 4 on the prohibition of the use of force, and Article 51 on the right to self-defense. But without prejudice to this, in the 1986 Nicaragua case, the International Court of Justice observed very interestingly that the UN Charter and I quote, by no means cover the whole area of the regulation of the use of force in international relations. And in Portugal's understanding, this observation by the International Court of Justice opens the door for a dynamic interpretation of the rules of international customary law that are contained in the Charter of the United Nations, such as the one concerning the use of force and the right to self-defense. this is a dynamic interpretation based on the development of state practice. And as a second comment, this time more connected to IHL and to today's topic, we also believe, we think that all colleagues here must be aware that we must not discuss the in outer space because IHL does apply. There can be no doubt about this. So even in the absence of an armed attack, even in the absence of weapons in space, there are IHL obligations that are applicable, even in peacetime. And I have mentioned this before this afternoon. So even this morning, the distinguished panelist from the RCRC, Ms. Wen Zhou, she mentioned how crucial satellites are, even today and for many years now, for the protection work that is made by humanitarian actors. So we do not see how the applicability of IHL can be discussed. We think that we should turn to a debate on the application of IHL. So how do we apply and disseminate the norms and principles that exist already and that are already binding on our states? Thank you.",2
S1M72,1,7,United Nations,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For your information, we will bring out a presentation on the screen, a slide presentation, which, as I hope, will help us in our discussion. Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! It's okay, don't worry, use the other one then. I apologize for the technical failure. I also bring in advance for a few unusual format of our presentation. Your Excellency, dear delegates, I would like to thank the Secretariat and the Chair for organizing this discussion group and for holding this important discussion. legal regimes, such as the Convention on the Law of the Sea. And we must talk about those elements that have a relationship with space. Often, the sea law compares to the law of space. And, accordingly, the interpretation that was made regarding various elements, including those related to space, is used. It is fair that what is applicable to the sea can be based on and for space exploration. That is, this regime can be applied to space. My colleague will go into more detail on this. Here is the presentation structure. It is not exhaustive in its scope. The range of all elements is quite wide. There will be mainly key concepts, rules, regulations and laws related to space. This is the structure you see on the slide, which I will follow during my presentation. First, a few words about the open sea space and space. There is a common characteristic. This is a common space where states cannot exercise sovereign rights, like on land. That is, there is a certain freedom, as you can see here on the slide, everything is written here. Freedom of navigation, freedom of flights and so on. All this is written in articles 1 and 2 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The UN Convention on the Maritime Rights talks about this in article 88. And often it is the most quoted principles of two spaces. Article 4 of the Convention on the Space and the Preamble to the Treaty. Nevertheless, this is the concept that has reached the level of international law. We have seen it in the last few days. Many have said that the peaceful use of space is not equal to the military use of space. That is, peaceful means non-aggressive. This interpretation is not universal, although most support it. And aggressive actions, the concept of this is also interpreted differently by people. In space, we have the same thing. And in the sea, that is, peaceful, it is definitely not aggressive. In the open sea, we have warships that go through the seas, conduct studies, research, and so on. There are underwater cables and other technical devices. And the most extreme example is... In this respect, compared to the concept of space, in the maritime law, we are establishing exclusive military zones, for example, for testing weapons. This is also done under international law. the creation of a space safety zone, unlike the open sea, may be difficult due to purely physical components. The state has some freedoms, but they do not act without punishment. There are certain restrictions, and Professor Arki spoke about this on the first day, so I will skip this. I would just like to remind delegates that this is a concept that is not defined in the Space Agreement, but is contained in the international law. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea mentions this principle several times. That is, there is also a interpretation of this principle, that is, states should refrain It is not good to say bad things about others who carry out space activities. In other words, states are restrained from any actions that undermine the activities of others. There is another principle, which is less comprehensive, which is cooperation and assistance. This is what is considered in the Navy and in the space rights. This is Article 5 of the Space Treaty, as well as an agreement on assistance and rescue operations. And of course we can take lessons from the sea right. You see, here everything is shown, the comparative analytics, both in space and in open sea spaces. The principles of the maritime law that can easily be applied to space. And there are many such cases. However, the adaptation of such a kind is not always easy. One example is the classification of ships, which differs from the classification of space objects. All ships must be marked. Red Cross for the sanitary courts and so on. And it is quite possible, if possible, that they should be registered internationally, so that they can be determined, identified and tied to a specific state in accordance with the Convention. In space, the marking becomes less significant, because it is not visible with the unarmed eye. But nevertheless, the state, where such a space object is registered, controls it. And we also have categories of military ships, auxiliary and so on. And this is mainly about the Navy. for example, research ships or meteorological research. Finally, we have commercial fleets. There is also a division into military and civilian satellites in space. But recently we see that such division is not clear and unambiguous. about the purpose or use of objects. Many delegates and many speakers spoke about this problem. I would like to make a distinction. By the way, yesterday it was said that this is a difference between double use and double purpose. Double use in space is often found. for military and civilian purposes. For example, the GNSS, the satellites of the GNSS system. This differs from double purpose. That is, for example, the elimination of space garbage, such objects. But they can also be used to cause harm to other satellites or objects. the There is a certain obligation in what concerns neutrality. I would like to remind the delegation that this is a principle that comes out of the right to sea rights. that is, commercial vessels should not be an object of conflict between two sides. In principle, this concept can be attributed to space. The double use of many space objects makes it difficult to determine the category of these objects. It is about the fact that neutral status is being lost. States that register and launch satellites can use them for their own purposes. That is, it can be a blow to certain obligations in relation to the neutral status of such objects. Now a few words about some mechanisms that are aimed at reducing tensions and preventing incidents at sea. These mechanisms can serve as a basis for the same approach in space. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea states that the state must ensure the safety of the sea. There are mechanisms, signal systems, and so on. Everything is listed here on this slide. All states must comply with the convention in this regard in order to avoid clashes. agreements, multilateral agreements on reducing tension, necessary or not, necessary for their performance, but nevertheless they can exist. Here are some examples. These two examples are particularly interesting for the purpose of our discussion, which are mandatory for the implementation of international agreements, in particular among European states. And the second example is not mandatory for the implementation of multilateral agreements. These agreements establish certain mechanisms that can be useful to reduce tensions between parties. These are the initiatives that have been useful at sea, but can also be useful in space. I believe it would be useful to consider all this. I would like to conclude my presentation on this. I am ready to say that our institute can support further research work on the use of international law in space based on the lessons learned from the use of sea law on Earth. Thank you, Ms. Arteaga, Unidir.",4
S1M74,1,7,Mississippi.,"I would like to thank you and the secretaries, dear delegates, for this opportunity to consider the applicable elements of the space and sea regime. In particular, as a rule, the division of military and civilian activities in the sea can be related to the challenge of space safety. I thank my colleague for what she said about the sea. but also several rules, but mainly it is the right to air use of the air space. Article 3 of the treaty recognizes many principles and legal regimes in the air, in the sea, in space. I would like to say about the understanding of the International Commission. The Commission noted that... The fragmentation should be considered in order to better understand the international law in this area. But in any case, it is necessary to consider what conditions are applicable in this regard. It is impossible to simply classify the activity in the sea, in the air or in the space. There are laws that we analyze. They have forms that specify objects when a specific law is applied, such as space objects, ships, and so on. or, for example, as a rule in the agreements, can also report on the applicability of this rule in practice. And today we see the regime applied in space on the basis of the Convention on Marine Law. The Chekhov Convention recognizes sovereignty of the state as an international air space. But on the other hand, we are talking about sovereignty but in the open sea and in the open air space. And the rules created by ICAO should be followed. That is, it is necessary to consider different international rights regimes in terms of application to space. But I don't think there are many laws that are directly applicable to the activities in the orbits. Nevertheless, in 1900... In 1910, there were still studies, where the rules could be applied to the air space, and it was done on the basis of the sea. So, today we are doing a comparative analysis to determine which principles, I will start with examples and then we will move on to discussing some challenges that are applicable to space activities. When I talk about principles, I talk about motivations that are based on some kind of law, not some formal principles of international law. So the principle of the common usable sphere. As my colleague said, at the basic level there are certain similarities between The air space and the open sea are both geographical spaces. The state does not have sovereignty, and it has to act in relation to some objects that are being moved there. We heard about flags that determine the national property of the ship. In the open sea there is a registration mechanism that gives national property. the Open Space Registration Agency. It could be described as national belonging, but for ships that move in the sea, for space objects, the state keeps its jurisdiction if certain formal requirements are met. So there are certain principles that are common for other regimes. There is a chart of the Chukart Convention, which distinguishes it from the Convention on the Maritime Right and the Space Convention on the Cosmos. And there is a position related to state and non-state activities, so we are using this example to demonstrate the connection between these various flag rules and the registration of space objects. The Chekhov Convention is only used by civilian aircraft. The Convention does not have any specific requirements. It is a broad concept of the state here than the concept of the military. In this sense, the Chekhov Convention is similar to the Convention of 1974 on the security of the sea or the Solos, which is not applied to military ships. These conventions are aimed at the preservation of human lives. They are provided with an inspection of the ships and air ships. They have very detailed and technical everything is written, which contrasts with the convention on open space. The Czech Convention, similar in this sense to the convention of 1972 on the prevention of collision in the sea, Colerag, and so on, contains safety rules when navigating. and the new IKAO. The COLAREG is the position that is the position that is The Chekhov Convention does not apply to the state flying equipment. It applies in this way, it presupposes the obligation of duty and surveillance. As it was stated in Article 7, the agreement on this space was a subject of discussion in the last meeting. Professor Aoki has already given a very good report on this. He mentioned that it also appears in the CPC. But I will probably tell you more about this. I hope that I will shed light on the importance of proper observation, which is important for space activity. The third article of the Chekhov Convention states that the negotiating party, when issuing its position on its state aircraft, must comply with the regulations of the Chekhov Convention. the principle of the proper surveillance and safety of navigation. The Convention also provides many other rules of civil aviation, and they are included in the proposal. So, perhaps, the general... We must consider the whole set of rules as a rule of duty of compliance or duty of consideration in relation to civilian aviation. The application of UNCLOS to aviation. Article 39 states that state aircraft can usually comply with the situation for the safety of the aircraft and comply with the safety of navigation. It is our duty to apply the rules of duty to the security of navigation in relation to civil and military traffic. The ICAO has detailed this connection between its safety rules and the duty of duty. General Assembly of the ICAO has decided that the state must ensure that the water operations must comply with the rules of the airspace adopted by the Chekhov Convention in Prop. 2. In other documents, the ICAO confirmed that the recognition of military operations sometimes requires not to comply with the air transport procedure, but called on the state to notify the air control authorities before taking any measures. The rules of civilian aviation are a means for the state to determine the borders of its military operations to ensure the safety of navigation. And this is a threshold below which the state cannot fall. There are often difficulties with the fixation, with the reflection of state activities in the rule, and there are technical difficulties, political concerns that do not allow the state to create such rules for space movement, to reduce the human sacrifice. But unfortunately, the state is usually encouraged to act only when people are dying. And... often... The information collection on satellites is difficult and there are not enough principles, incentives for the compliance of international rules. Many rules do not exist for satellites and non-state organizations. There are often some bans in this area and navigation positions, In many ways they do not regulate space activity. Nevertheless, I am optimistic that the increase in trauma the emergence of new space states and the growth of non-state space operators can have a positive effect on the confirmation and determination of the rules and principles of safe behavior. When new subjects appear, they need new data and there is a need for states to behave responsibly and determine what responsible behavior is. When it is done, it is easier to determine that it is not. The history of the sea rights and the Chekhov Convention demonstrates this. I would like to have a reason to believe that the history of the sea rights is demonstrated. But I met Peter Zinger, a scientific worker at the Brookings Institute. He writes about cyber war and state-owned hunting activities. And if we look at the work of Emer Adyavatele, we will see that... The use of trade and other commercial vessels for piracy is not only legal, but economically permissible and preferable. The opening of the sea corridors to preserve them for use for trade has a place here for Of course, it is impossible to solve all the issues related to the arms race, but when the Chekhov Convention was the subject of the talks, there were many types of weapons today. The aircraft were the most deadly weapons, and this was brought into the space age. This is evidenced by the preparatory work to create a special Khopov 58. And I think that we can count on the measures to strengthen trust. States unite to create rules for the most dangerous weapons in 1944. Not all states participated in the fight against the lethal weapons. But then the Chekhov Convention... achieved the level of the general perception. Now there are 193 parties that agree on this. Therefore, I support Professor Kokulov's comments. of the civil and military space objects. The Chekhov Convention is only applied to civil flying parades. It allowed for the development of this sphere. I think there are ways to reduce these concerns. This is a question of politics and the fact that he wants to follow this way for the state. And the laws and regulations can give the necessary analysis for this.",2
S1M76,1,7,Australia,"Thank you very much. Today's panel was a presentation that opened our eyes a lot. the concept of the duty to accept and respect it. When it is not performed in maritime operations, how does it consider the right? Is there any court or any arbiter who can solve this issue? Thank you, Australia, for this question. I return to the panelists. Maybe Ms. Oskar would like to answer him? Thank you for the question. I think it is one of the key issues of international law. Steptists often say that international law does not really exist, because it is very difficult to force it to be implemented. And the sea law has established certain procedures in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. and any disobedience. And if the state participates in this convention, they can be brought, so to speak, by this convention through the international court. And, of course, the interpretations are different. And, of course... I understand what worries the Australian representative, but I hope that I answered to some extent this question.",2
S1M78,1,7,Canada,"Thank you for your words, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank both of you for your speeches. It was very useful for us to learn about the procedures, practices, standards, recommendations, legal conditions, and the correct behavior in the open sea and space. My question to Mr. Stoltler. Could you tell us more about the status of... and the practices recommended by the law in the Chekhov Convention. And speaking of the intercept of civilian satellites, how does it relate to the principle of proper observation and also the 3bis article? It is a more legally obligatory interpretation of the principle of proper observation.",2
S1M711,1,7,Chile,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the speakers who spoke today. I have a question, not a comment. You mentioned the issue of dual use and the difference between dual use and dual purpose. I would like you to tell us more about this, because you made an emphasis on this in your presentations. the Space Agreement was created, how it can cover this aspect, and how these differences influence the idea of responsible behavior. Thank you, dear representative. Thank you for your questions. Mrs. Skorot, I give you the floor.",2
S1M712,1,7,Mississippi,"Thank you, the Chile delegation, for your question about the difference between double use and double purpose. The idea of double purpose, double use, means that it will serve both civilian and military purposes, or commercial purposes. On the other hand... The concept of double purpose means that an object is created only for peaceful purposes, for charitable purposes. However, it can be reoriented. I don't know how to say it in Spanish. So the idea of dual use is usually not directed against satellites. If it is a double-use satellite, it can perform some military functions. What we have been talking about these days is not about aggressive actions, it has mostly peaceful orientation. There is a case of a GMSS satellite. For example, civil authorities and agencies can use Google maps for their purposes. They can also use military maps to track the movement of troops, for example. However, the idea of double purpose... If we look at what it is, we will see the danger, because these are some objects that are created exclusively for charitable purposes, to remove the space debris. This is a completely positive activity, peaceful, for example, especially regarding debris. and here we are entering into the discussion not about the nature of the object, but how it is used. And that is why double purpose objects can be used irresponsibly. for example, to attack another satellite, and it should not be so. Therefore, it is important to restore the transparency and communication mechanisms so that the lack of communication or incorrect information about the use of these objects and the tension between various subjects. Regarding the responsibility regime, the issue of Article 6 of the Space Agreement is based on the fact that the state must bear responsibility for the activity of their national subjects, whether state or non-state subjects. Therefore, this also applies to these objects of dual use and dual purpose. It is also often seen that the objects of dual use are constructed to some commercial subjects that fall under this responsibility regime. And here, the state registration could contribute to the establishment of the responsibility regime. I hope I answered your question. But of course, I can do this in more detail if necessary.",2
S1M714,1,7,Germany,"I would like to ask a question, but first I would like to thank both speakers for their presentation. I have two questions. One is for Ms. Artega about the interaction between physical and security, and various aspects of security. You said that in the case of the In the military sphere, these are the two concepts of safety and security. I wanted to ask, we have a level of position that regulates the operation. objects. And the other level is about behavior, how good it is or vice versa. And speaking of the marine sphere, we need to ask ourselves what we can learn from this. And we are using a two-level space regulation system. We have Copius. What measures are there to solve the security issue? Mr. Stotler, I would like to ask you to explain in more detail. Thank you, Chair, and thank you also for that. My promotion of the service ladder that you just carried out. Yes, so here is a very interesting question. The Navy requires to ensure safety. safety agreement on preventing an accident or collision in the open sea between the USA and the Soviet Union at that time. The term safety is also mentioned there. Security is never mentioned. But the idea and the purpose of this agreement is really full security. The provision of this full security. Sometimes they are different, safety and insecurity. Sometimes they coincide. But here we are talking about full security.",2
S1M717,1,7,Brazil,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chen. uh We are talking about the support of the proposal to disperse civil and military objects in space. If possible, could you stop at this point in more detail? about this opinion. I would like to know your point of view regarding the practicality of this proposal, especially... from the point of view of Ms. Ortega, when she spoke about double use, double purpose of objects in space. That is, civilian initially, but can be or re-equipped or re-equipped or transformed military. Thank you.",2
S1M719,1,7,Canada,"Thank you for your questions. To begin with, regarding the question of the spread of... I read Dr. Kapler's statement. I understand that his opinion is coming from... He spoke on Monday, that he spoke about the upcoming violation of possible conflict as an impulse for the spread of differences. I agree with his assessment of this issue. It is very important that the state... seriously perceived violations, intentional initial violations. But I don't think I can show it. It seems to me that the difference between civilian military aircraft and the creation of a regulatory regime for civilian aviation can be seen as a measure of forming trust, which later led to the universal acceptance of the position of the Chicago Convention which has significantly advanced the progress of humanity. Support for this opinion is based on analysis, on synergies, which allow us to assume that benefits can arise not only from the point of view of military or civil, but also from the point of view of creating certain regimes that form trust. Yes, in some circumstances it is not practical and unrealistic. GPS, for example, but in other cases it is possible and feasible. And categorization should not be government-oriented, in contrast, not government-oriented. I think that the state can reduce tensions. including not only commercial objects, but also scientific and space exploration in regulatory frameworks, which will demonstrate transparency and create trust. I think I talked about this, the creation of trust, reducing tensions, and so on. But also, as a result, there will be an economic significant return, that is, a positive return for people living on Earth, I mean the destruction of these systems. Thank you, Dr. Stotler, for your answer. Ms. Askarate, Ms. Ortega, maybe you will add something?",2
S1M720,1,7,Mississippi,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, dear Brazil, for this question. I may not agree with my colleague. and Professor Koppler, although I have great respect for both of them. This theory of the spread of military and civilian objects is an interesting, good, beautiful idea. It is quite reasonable, but from a practical point of view, it seems to me, is not feasible. of the two purposes. Therefore, when it was about differences between civil and military, it was about obstacles for the state, which must overcome the economic consequences of such actions. I agree with this, but there is another obstacle that the state must overcome in this regard, namely... We talked about how full the orbits are, especially low orbits, there are a lot of objects. If we are to spread the substantial volume of these objects into two categories, it will allow us to load these orbits even more, that is, this is an absolutely unrealizable moment. There are many categorization objects, it may only interfere with this, make it more serious. From the point of view of conflicts, yes, it is possible that the situation could be easier, but I think the nature of space objects in orbit does not make it possible. remember not only about the nature of the objects, but how they are used, what services they provide, in particular to civil administrations, but at the same time they can provide military information, that is, analysis of proportionality It is necessary to conduct such an analysis in order to determine whether these are civilian or military objects. But I agree with my colleague that these are complex issues that should often be considered individually, depending on the individual situation. We have to think about how to regulate their existence, so that the existence of such objects does not lead to an increase in tension.",2
S1M722,1,7,Korea,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you very much to our speakers. As I mentioned, there is a difference between space, air and sea spaces. And at the same time, there are similar elements. The increase of transparency and trust in other measures of responsible behavior led to an international regime that regulates the air industry. That is, we can borrow these ideas in order to find out the norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior in the space. how these principles, which are written in Article 9 of the Space Agreement, can be specifically applied in space. We see the importance of formulating the selection of space objects. of the system of notifications that would reduce the threat of space security. I note that the Philippines has proposed to conduct the corresponding consultations. I mean, it would be interesting to modify their working documents. And in this regard, I would like to ask the question, what measures can be the pre-required Thank you, dear representative of Republic of Korea, for this question. I think that I can send it to the system that I characterized in my work document, one of the places where it is said that the state understands that they should step away from their actions, and the air space, and the notifications are required, and so on. That is, the state understands the potential of the deviation from the norm, behavioral norms that can be applied to this working group, We can use the warning system. It already exists in the air space. We just need to determine how these positions, for example, in aviation, in the sea, can be in this plane, which already acts, can be applicable to space.",4
S1M724,1,7,Italy,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, colleagues. Thank you for this presentation. Another very interesting discussion today. A couple of questions for our speakers. The first question is related to the elements that Dr. Skaraty presented, where the neutralization law was discussed. It is absolutely clear that there are differences when it comes to conflicts. And in the presentation it was said about the obligations of the fighting and non-fighting parties. But... principles of behavioral models. I would like to know how they are applicable to a peaceful time, a peaceful action in space. I am not a specialist, but I am sure that there are elements of neutral status that can be relevant both during and during peacetime. Do you have any ideas that could be useful for our work? is less legal, more historical and political. I apologize. Maybe it's not your field of expertise. I'm sure you can answer this question better than I can. It's about the parallelism of the sea rights and the question of colleagues from Germany. That is, the long process that led to the Anklos and the maritime law Do you see any parallels with this diplomatic process, for example, in the space? When the conventions were held, there were elements that could be used, I am not going to transfer the meeting of the working group in the Montego Bay in Jamaica, as it was with the sea rights, but maybe this process on the sea rights can be useful for us too. Here is such an interesting question, an interesting proposal to transfer the meeting place of this working group in Montego Bay. But it's quite hot there, by the way. And here in this hall it's cool and comfortable. So, ladies and gentlemen, Oscar. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to the delegates from Italy. As for your first question about neutrality, what is happening in the armed conflicts, we are talking about two sides that would come to this understanding. You are right that we can borrow some ideas from this right and apply them in peacetime in space. in the course of his presentation, the characteristics of space systems are such that... That is, there may be more than one state launching a satellite, but there may be many states that receive benefits from such a satellite and win it. Even if, for example, one of these states actually launched this satellite. What can be done to guarantee that if there is a conflict in the space, what can be done? Namely, full consciousness, if you want, to whom the space object provides services. For example, if the services are provided by the hostile side... For example, a satellite that belongs to several states and one of them makes a decision to provide services by providing assistance to the warring side in the armed conflict, then other states that launch the war can be involved in this conflict and thus the neutral status will be violated. It is important to know which state launches the satellite, who owns it, and to remember about it. From the point of view of armed conflicts, of course, I do not approve the conduct of space battles. But it may happen that you may make a military decision. to determine space objects, but by means of this method you can choose an object that belongs only to one state or that is in service to one state. Well, in any case, in peacetime such awareness allows to take action to reduce human casualties. humanitarian sacrifice. The second question is about the parallels between the sea rights and space. If I understood your question correctly, you have the impression that in space we are lagging behind in the planet process, lagging behind the sea rights process, which could allow to eliminate the threats in space. In the maritime law, the state has developed a common understanding when it comes to signals, signal systems, universal systems, signals that recognize all these signals. The system is used to communicate with states in potential situations of conflict in order to avoid misunderstanding or calculations. Of course, we can't just copy this system by the reasons that my colleague mentioned earlier, but we can get some ideas from this process. And again, I'm talking about the formation of a general understanding, which is not yet in what concerns the space space. So, my recommendation, in response to your question.",2
S1M726,1,7,Canada,"Yes, Mr. Chairman, briefly on historical and political issues. I was reminded by the discussion at the Sea Convention. We talked about the volume of the right. My colleague said that if you put all the agreements, principles, recommendations, You will have a single selection of rights, but they will be different. Agreements, agreements and so on. I was talking about in my speech, that the decrease of activities and the active persons and the maritime law is based on history and tradition and this is the result of the interaction of various parties can also occur in space. It was not in the direction of development, formation, creation of the rocket after the Second World War. And then it was all in the field of state military activity. That is, there were no developments to date, rules on a traditional basis. I see historical parallels. I mean laws that were developed within these processes, with the use or attraction of the users of these laws at that time.",2
S1M728,1,7,France,"and thank you very much to our two speakers. Thank you very much to the two speakers we listened to this morning. The discussion is very interesting. I have three questions or even three comments. Let's say that the Lincsie agreement was mentioned. I mean, related to the sea rights. These agreements that were approved are very interesting. They can be a source of inspiration for our working group. The UN General Secretary's contribution in May 2021, when France proposed that the state should form a two-way multi-way system for consultation and lowering the level of conflict, including in space, in order to reduce the risk of conflicts in space. And here we are inevitably thinking about what is happening in the sea, in the sea. We heard recommendations, advice, which we could consider, taking into account different elements that could be applied to the space. The second comment is the air space of the Chekhov Convention. If I understood correctly, this convention is related to civil aviation. As for space, it is about space traffic management. That's how I would characterize it. Such questions are usually solved in Vienna, in the Committee on the Use of the Stratosphere. This group that is focused on disarmament, can the Chekhov Convention help us or better leave it to Vienna? Today we are doing parallel between air space and sea space. But we are talking about cyberspace. And here are many analogies with cyberspace. It is extra atmospheric. It is difficult to identify a threat, to identify a character, to identify who it comes from. I know that our colleagues in the cyberspace have created a working group and developed a number of standards. responsible behavior in cyberspace. So I think we could also emphasize inspiration in the work of this group. I don't know if there is any opinion about this those who spoke today, but in my opinion this is good food for our collective thoughts.",2
S1M730,1,7,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, dear delegate of France, for this question. I will start with the question of the airspace. Is the Chicago Convention applied to... and the generalization of these spaces. Should our committee consider the Chekhov Convention, or maybe it's a question for the copy, because it's very interesting. If we look at the history of the process of disarmament, the peaceful initiatives in space, I said at the beginning, that there were disputes about whether it was necessary to include the issue of disarmament in the copy. The KOPIUS had talks about weapons in space, and we saw the emergence of arguments that the KOPIUS is not the right forum for this, not the right arena. I understand that the mandate of our group is to consider the rules, norms and principles. space activities are not necessarily about measures to strengthen transparency and trust. But there are institutions that deal with the issue of disarmament and civil activities, such as OPIUS. And, of course, here we see the influence of efforts and initiatives from the various organizations. And I don't know why our group would not consider recommendations regarding the regulating positions dedicated to space, if it could reduce the tension on the issue of bilateral or multilateral controversy. I think it's a great idea. The Secretary General works on this for verification purposes, including in terms of the registration convention. And I don't know, it's mostly bilateral contacts, rather than multilateral. And of course, here the transition of work to space would be very desirable. There is, of course, a difference in direction, in direction, as you all know. Space and the legal environment are quite unique here, because... We see here powerful agreements that appeared quite early. We do not see this in the sea area, which there was more of a normal right. But we see here a big coincidence, especially when the state is successful. We see here a big... I would say, interlaying, coincidence. space activities and activities in cyberspace. There is a lot in common here, and this must be taken into account in the work of our group.",2
S1M732,1,7,Askara,"Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the delegation of France. I will try to answer in French. I apologize. I agree with you. There is a principle. He has a relationship with the work of our group. I think that... I managed to cope with it very well. We tried to find... The general understanding of these things is very important for working in space. We need to find the general understanding of definitions. This is what several delegations have been talking about in recent days. In UNIDIR we are developing a glossary of terminology. for general use, for example, in terms of dual use, as I said before, and in such terms. to have such an instrument. in the sea right, it would be good. We have, for example, signal codes. They could be reproduced for the purposes of space. So yes, reproduced and used. That's what I could say at the moment.",2
S1M734,1,7,Japan,"Thank you very much. I would like to thank both of the speakers for their very stimulating performance. They are very... You gave a lot of food for discussion and thinking. Yes, it is very interesting that the situation of the Chekhov Convention was touched upon, which could be applicable to space. My question is the following. As far as I understand, any legal situation... are a compilation of some specific codifications. It is always a combination of very specific, specific codifications. and this is related to the concept of due regard, the proper observation. the next report And my question is in what situations do these statements about the concept of due regard, the relevant account, work? And when... They don't work in other areas. As far as I understand, your presentation was... The reporter is sorry. He's saying it differently. We talked about other spaces, for example, in the sea space and in the air space. When? When do the Codex and the regulations work? When do they not work? When do the specific codifications, the specific regulations and norms not work?",2
S1M736,1,7,Askarta,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the delegation of Japan for your question. I apologize, but I'm not sure that I understood your question correctly. So I will try to answer and then add... I think I understood your question incorrectly. The principle of the relevant report is already codified in the agreement. space. In Article 9, it applies to all types of space activities. They all must be carried out with proper consideration. If the state wants to use space for the purpose of research and use, I do not agree with the assessment that the representative of Japan For example, there are many norms of ordinary law that are not codified or partially codified in various agreements. The idea of the right to custom or the right to common law should not be omitted. We must remember this. The use of space for peaceful purposes... It is fixed in principles, not in a contract, but in principles that relate to the usual international law. That's all I can say at this moment. I would be glad if you clarify your question, because I did not fully understand it.",2
S1M738,1,7,Japan,"My question is, thank you for giving me the floor again. What I wanted to ask... in the process of the work of our open working group. We were asking ourselves what is the concept of the Deurigard, which is a relevant account, and what is the situation in this connection, when this concept works in relation to the open space. That is why I would like to ask when, in what situations... The codification of this concept would be useful. I understand that our question is very vague. So I should probably continue to work on this issue myself. Thank you very much.",2
S1M740,1,7,United States,We asked other colleagues in our room. Thank you to the participants of our panel. We understand the importance of continuing this discussion.,2
S1M742,1,7,Sweden,"Thank you. I want to thank both panelists for the wonderful presentations. Since it is the first time that my delegation has turned on the microphone, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the chairman who is able to hold the meeting and the secretariat. I have a question for Professor Stotler. Could you... to tell in more detail, and maybe to give examples of the role of commercial subjects and non-state subjects play in the change of perception that led to the change of the air rights and the Chekhov Convention on piracy, in particular. Maybe... Could you give us some advice on how to build a better job and how to involve commercial and non-governmental entities? Thank you.",2
S1M744,1,7,Mississippi,"Thank you, chairman. Thank you for your question. Sweden. and how commercial subjects... As far as I understand this question correctly, Mr. Stoltler, what role does it play? Aviation is different because there are many different subjects with great potential. Small companies, big companies. And here I do not look at the obvious parallels with aviation at the moment. There are companies that act like aviation companies. I will put aside the idea of changes and first I will say how commercial subjects could participate in the work of our group. of commercial subjects, non-governmental subjects. Here you need to understand the priorities and you need to understand... the importance of entertainment, separation of them, so that... I have a question. There is an international trade association on space subjects. It was established as a quasi-international organization of the NGAO. And today it is just... association, one of the core activities. There are many UN forums. I don't see a special difference between them and associations. Here, it is important to participate in civil society. I think their participation can be very valuable for understanding our work and how to make it more sustainable and sustainable. So I agree with you on the issue of changes. Commercial subjects often engage in lobbying and they often influence the definition of priorities at the level of government. We see this at the international level, at the domestic level, including in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization has commercial subjects, they provide their civil expertise and experience. There is also a technical subcommittee where they participate. This work is quite active. They actively participate in working groups. and I think that here... We see the change of the legal environment for the benefit of many subjects operating in the space. Chairman: Thank you Dr. Stotler for this answer. Now we have... Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you for your speech on the regime that regulates the activity in the sea and space, contributes to the reduction of threats and the composition of regimes. It is of special interest here. Here, peaceful aspects are important for the space as well as for other spaces. It is very important that the subjects refrain from activities that are incompatible with this special status. Otherwise, it would have blown up the idea. The idea is that we need to protect the space from conflicts. I would like to ask the panel members to compare the use of aviation and the use of space in the sea. We have three spheres. I think we need some legal obligations, some non-legal agreements. As for the work of our group, how could it benefit from the use of the International Law Commission? I mean... and harmonization of legal regimes that are spreading to these particular areas and other areas. Thank you for your speech. I suggest that we first address this issue of Ms. Oskarote.",2
S1M745,1,7,Algeria,"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to the Alger delegation for your attention. If I understood you correctly, you said that this regime, which is supposed to be peaceful, is operating in space. But I must remind all delegations that there is nothing new here. It also existed in the sea space. Article 88. Young Claws. It also sets a similar regime for the marine space. which is called the term high seas in English. I don't know how to say it in French, Mrs. Ortega. But if I understood your question correctly... But your question was... What lessons can be learned from the sea right? how to apply these lessons for the space space. That is, do we need here the legal tools or not. I think that they are not mutually exclusive. That is, the legal obligations and voluntary measures are not mutually exclusive. I think... If we are looking for a legally binding instrument, it is important that the same formulations are used, and that it is based on consensus, a unified understanding of what we are discussing. And it is difficult to have some kind of a unified approach here. It is absent in the space field. We have to start from this, before we start to develop some legally obligatory measures and tools. I think we have to strive for this goal, and our group is doing it. And we need to achieve this goal. Now... What lessons can be learned from the sea law? I think I have already given examples of how the state came to an agreement regarding various aspects. restrictions. I think we should remember this when talking about space safety. Thank you.",2
S1M747,1,7,Canada,"Thank you, dear delegated by Algeria, for your question. The first part, as far as I understand, concerned the threat to the sea space and space and how different regimes and agreements approach this. I think there are some common features between these spaces and this approach to determining activity. Just uh... different threats are perceived and as a result planes are knocked down because they are being looked at as a threat. So this question of the perception of threats, it is here, of course, and here there are certain technological difficulties in solving these issues and it is difficult, of course, to determine The hostility is not hostile. As for the maritime law, there are various tensions, contradictions between civil subjects of one state and subjects of another state. This is, of course, some analogy. I see an analogy with the air space, aviation. The first one is the third article, the use of weapons against aircraft. This is a mixture of rigid and soft legal methods. There is a space agreement, and there are certain principles. There are various solutions for these problems. Of course, there are some fragmentation in our game as a result of various approaches to this problem, but there is also the possibility of other people's participation. and the International law concerns the activities of various states. And here we are talking about issues that states should consider the applicability of all these rules. And if there is an opportunity for conflict between various rules, then maybe... We need to address the norms of responsibility for the event. When there is a conflict, we need to develop rules on how to solve these problems. If it is impossible to agree on various agreements, then we need to analyze how to resolve this conflict and determine which of the two opposing rules will be applied. Of course, there is a possibility of contradiction between various norms, and of course, various norms are very important here. And now... Thank you for watching! Some delegations asked how air and sea modes can make their own contribution to the Chekhov Convention. It was mentioned mainly for the safety of civil aviation. I would just like to say that it was a unique process of developing applications, these are standards. is necessary for execution. But the processes of developing standards and recommended practices were such that is, a new recommended practice is developed which is turned into standards. That is, this is a process of recommendations into standards and sometimes even into an obligatory position. the Chekhov Convention. of course, make efforts to spread military and civilian aircraft. But in practice, it's not so easy. We learned in practice that many aircraft registered in the civilian registry are sometimes used for state purposes. civil functions, that is, the differences are not so clear. In Canada, we see this kind of requests and it is very difficult to make differences, although efforts are being made to distinguish between military and civilian aircraft, equipment, targets and so on. Thank you. Thank you, Canada. Dr. Stotler. Chair, and thank you again for questions from the distinguished delegate from Canada. Canada: Thank you, Mr. President. Canada is potentially useful for our work. It may be useful, in particular, for how it was used in the description of all these processes. I could use the same wording. and it is really important that the state, instead of a complicated process of WCAO, the working group and so on, and then the approval of the Council, That is, the state has a mechanism for developing recommended practices, implementation of these practices, without obliging other states to implement the standards as you mentioned earlier, as with the usual international law. This is connected with... This is an evolutionary procedure of standard production from recommendations to standards. That is, this is a positive process. By the way, it is about the same as the procedure of production of unnecessary regulations and other norms. We saw in this declaration, according to the principles, that is, it is translated into a certain position. There is no other organization besides Ikea that could do this work. On the issue of difficulties when the state uses civilian planes not for civilian purposes, there are cases of such use when passenger planes in the cargo compartment were transporting weapons, No But due to the fact that some states are not trying to turn these positions into practice, it does not mean that nothing is happening and the rules are not being followed. That is, one should not focus on cases of violations. One should see when the system works, Thank you, Dr. Stotler. Before we continue our work, I would like to remind delegates that all delegations will have the opportunity to speak on these issues not only now, but also in the afternoon. Therefore, I ask the delegation at this stage to limit their speeches. The questions that we could address to our speakers, our speakers, the discussion can take place at the meeting of the United Kingdom. United Kingdom: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for the word. I will try to be brief. Thank you for this amazing discussion group today. I would like to say that the Chekhov Convention is based on civil aviation and encourages the state to the same behavior model. space and the use of weapons. Professor Stotler has just mentioned this. And these are really such cases that undermine laws and rights. How can we ensure the safety of satellites? in connection with possible military conflicts, when military actions are carried out in the orbit of the Earth in relation to satellites. Are there any comments on the distinction between this and the military behavior of the state? as soon as we separate from the disarmament and these civilian military satellites and so on, that is, you could not tell more in depth about this and interesting communication between specific regimes in specific areas. element instead of a general discussion.",2
S1M749,1,7,Canada,"thank you, dear representative of the United Kingdom. I will start. The use of force in the Tribis allows me to correct some things, but the concrete formulation of the use of weapons against aerial vehicles There were some interesting questions about the use of force, not weapons. I think that one of the reasons is... Serving. The war laws are not necessarily applied in this. It is not necessary to consider it as an armed attack on another state. That's why such a phraseology was chosen. Because weapons are not used because discussions are held on this term in this group and in other groups. This may show that some principles of civilian aviation do not take place in other areas or domains. Flight safety. I believe the question was about the guarantees of flight safety. Safe passage. How could this potentially demonstrate the mechanism of ensuring safe space flights? That is, if some kind of parallel... We need to understand that safety and security are different concepts. Safety is... No. damage due to equipment failure or human error. I mean the flight system or the plane. We need data on tracking. and in the end some mechanisms of coordination for many satellites. This is a question of safety. The questions of the security, two different concepts, two different questions, two different approaches, safety and security. for space.",2
S1M751,1,7,Spain,"Thank you very much. which exists today. And maybe it will be in line with our work. Another question has been asked several times and has already been voiced. Namely, more information about the functioning of satellites, their registration. We are not quite clear and clear.",2
S1M753,1,7,Austria,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the experts for the great presentations. And now my question. Question to both. Maybe you have a specific idea about how to strengthen the operating mechanisms and documents? And here I am referring to Article 9 of the Space Agreement. Ms. Skorota mentioned this or mechanisms of registration conventions, for example, a more clear identification, taking into account the experience of the sea right. And this is also related to the issue of Spain.",2
S1M755,1,7,China,"Thank you, President. I would like to thank the two speakers for the wonderful presentation we heard this morning. We have to study the air and sea modes in the use of the corresponding elements, the diverging elements. And after this in-depth analysis, we will be able to form a consensus. But in general, I would like to say the following. First, many delegates mentioned peacetime. I would, with some precaution, approach to use this term, because it is immediately in the counterweight can be used not for peace of time and maybe some legitimization of the use of force. Some delegates said that if the norms of cyberspace can be applied to space. Norms in cyberspace in 2015 were discussed by a group of international experts. recommendations. If it can play a prevention of armed conflicts, then it would be useful application of all this and further. And now my questions. First. The speakers mentioned the fragility of aviation with space. I would like to ask a question about what separates, spreads these areas of space, air and water. Next, another question. peace of mind, you said, is a serious concept, a long-term concept. A number of agreements are already used. And the question to both speakers. If we take the Antarctic agreement, what principles of this agreement can be used here? And finally, the third question. Italian delegate mentioned that... The air and sea agreements were formed on the basis of long processes. The reason for such a long process is that there is a long history of armed conflicts in the aviation and open sea space. We do not have such a history in space yet. That is, what can you say on this topic? Thank you.",2
S1M757,1,7,Oskarot,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll start with the question. If, for example, there is more information on the registration of satellites, how useful will it be? This is, in my opinion, a question from Spain. If I answer in Spanish, with your permission... The representative of Spain also asked questions about the methods of identification of aircraft and ships. There are differences in identification methods, especially in relation to satellites and other objects in space. Many methods of identification of ships and airliners rely on visual identification. which are visible in space, it is much more difficult, because it is simply impossible to see such a marking in space. I mean to see with human eyes, without appropriate instruments. Also, can the UN registration system provide a simpler identification of space objects? I think that was also the question. Yes, maybe it's fair, but there are other mechanisms that can help not in terms of object identification, but identification of ways of using them. and this can be obtained by moving between the orbits of space objects, information from registers, and so on. I am sure that, taking into account this amount of knowledge, we can make more specific... The Is your Is The We need to use what is already being used, is being done, and use this experience in another area. It will be useful. The Dewey Guard principle. This principle can also be applied in all activities in space. There are certain types of activities. which the delegates called irresponsible or potentially irresponsible. For example, the intention of creating space garbage that can be in the works for a long time. That is, it can be irresponsible, as well as objective violation of rules and obligations. And this can lead to the interpretation of the corresponding activities on the use of space objects. Well, finally, the question of delegates from China. He mentioned the following, that we need to carefully approach the use of the term of non-peaceful time, because it legitimizes the use of force or the conduct of armed conflicts in space. Although I accept his opinion, but I do not agree with him, because it is important that we prevent conflicts in space, this is the main, this is the first step. uh We must be ready to the fact that this may not happen, that is, we will not cope with this prophylactic, but and therefore it is necessary to conduct analytical work, what the result will lead to if we will use the worst scenarios. And here we talked about the use of MGP. I agree with that. But I don't think that if we use this phraseology, it will automatically lead to legitimization of armed conflicts or the use of force. What I wanted to say when I used the phrase, I wanted to say that this is the concept and I agree with him that it is mentioned in the Space Treaty and in particular in other treaties, for example, as he said, it was his example, the Treaty of Antarctica.",2
S1M759,1,7,Cuba,"Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Thank you panelists and reporters. I have a question for Ms. Askarate. We heard her in her presentation about various aspects of the maritime law and... and how it can be adapted to the space. There are a number of positions in this convention that are relevant in this regard. I would like to hear your opinion about the applicability of this for the space and how our group could use the article 162. and 189. How can we consolidate the appropriate positions to ensure a peaceful nature of space activity? to make all the resources used for the benefit of humanity, and how developing countries could use this space. Thank you, dear representatives of Cuba and Iran. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank both panelists for their views in this area. My first question and comment is about... of the space industry. the extreme militarization of space as a source of threat and even possible conflicts potentially in space in this connection. of the development of mineral resources, resources of the seabed, which are the assets of all mankind. Here, it is important to protect the ecosystem of the seabed, the ocean, and the issue of jurisdiction. There are two tasks here. The first is to provide equal opportunities to participate in all this for developing countries. Is it possible to expand this into space? Is it possible to use the good from this to all states? Because there is a tendency to... It is clear that some states are trying to use these resources as part of the coalition, instead of using them for the benefit of all humanity. This is connected with the Moon agreement.",2
S1M761,1,7,Pakistan,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank all the speakers for their very useful presentations and fruitful exchange of opinions. Before asking the question, I would like to say a couple of observations. I watched the discussion, the questions and answers, and there is... recognition that there is a place for analogies between the realities of space and the sea space. In this regard, there is a commission on safety. There is some coincidence in the field of activity with the open group. And here it is possible to act on other platforms. And then... I don't want to generalize here, but the rights of the sea and air space, the Chekhov Convention, look at this from the perspective of security and operational security. Here is another set of rules. And as far as I understand, we assume that it will also be in relation to space. Conflicts will be regulated by some other rules, by another set of rules, for example, as in relation to the ground space. And here my delegation has a problem, if that is so, because it would be a significant deviation from the long-term... We believe that the aim of such as the ship, the prevention of arms race in space, and the peace character of space should be preserved. The question in this regard is, since there are specific rules for the introduction of war, the area of operation and security aspects are important here. Do we need to consider the rules that prevent conflicts and wars in the open space, and not only the operational side? I mean, I want to say how would a conflict in the open space look like. I think we need to figure out how to use these two conventions to ensure that space does not become a place for hostilities. What specific rules are needed to limit space? the possibility of conducting combat operations in space. The second question is for Professor Stotler. This is rather an observation, a remark. The Chekhov Convention is dedicated to piloting flights, as far as I understand. And space, there are mainly non-pilot objects. How does the Chekhov Convention... and the UNV. the aircraft. and in comparison with the piloted ones. As far as I understand, it's unmanned. So please tell us more about it.",2
S1M763,1,7,Indonesia,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the floor. To save time, I will say briefly. First of all, I would like to thank both of the speakers and the participants of the interesting discussion. My only question is similar to the previous one. From Cuba and Pakistan, I completely disagree with the view of the delegation of Pakistan. Relatively... the possibility of possible common features and commonness in the regime and in the security aspects of these two spaces. And my question to the panelists is... Our work is dedicated to disarmament and security issues. I would like to know what elements, especially ANKLOS, offer potential solutions to ensure responsible behavior of the states. and whether our discussion will lead to a legally obligatory or non-obligatory instrument in the future.",2
S1M765,1,7,Oskar,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all delegates for all your questions. They are all very interesting. I will try to answer them all briefly. I can answer to the delegate Kuba. She asked about the possibility of applying the position of the sea right in the space and affected aspects of human dignity. This was discussed in the past. There is an agreement on the so-called Moon. And there it was said that it is a common heritage of all mankind. It is not widely accepted by international community. Not only the idea... the perception of this common heritage, but also other aspects are not used enough and taken into account. And here it is difficult to convince the international community to apply these principles, because this is a similar principle, although there are legal differences, of course. This principle that this is the province of all humanity, literally speaking. The principle is a more neutral thing in its nature. But this is my personal opinion. The idea of the common heritage of humanity is associated with the concept of lex cumulis. This is a concept of private rights. And it is not so easy to use the concept of private rights, applying them to public rights, because here a collision is created. Article 2 of the Open Space Treaty creates a certain risk in this regard. So here some concepts are difficult to apply. Then the Iran issue regarding the commercialization of space. And how such competition can it lead to threats? I have no perfect answer here, but I think that it will cause a reverse effect when a lot of commercial non-military subjects appear. They will use it for non-commercial purposes. This may lead to the state admitting that this sphere, which should be peaceful, development and measures to ensure this. Let's move on to the question of Pakistan. Indonesia also asked about the importance of the The air and sea rights were mentioned. The delegate said that these legal regimes allow the introduction of war here. But in my opinion, not a single legal regime allows the introduction of war. There is no exception to this in the sea law or in the... But it's about how to soften the human consequences if war happens. But it doesn't mean that it's allowed, it's prohibited. The use of force is prohibited by the UN Charter. So, of course, the sea right and the right to the air space can be applied in space, although, of course, we need to consider what will happen if there is an armed conflict in space. That's what I can answer at the moment. And I will be ready, if the question is clarified, to give another, more extensive answer. Thank you for your questions. Prof. Stotler-Yan says, I will start with a comment from my colleague regarding the use of... We have the right to stop the conflict. If the conflict has already started, we need to control the behavior of the parties. The question is not whether it is applicable in space, but how these principles relate to other norms. There was a question from Iran about extreme commercialization. And in my opinion, this is a two-fingered sword. As my colleague rightly said, the growth of commercialization on the one hand will cause, so to speak, a collision in space, some, but there is also the opposite side. And here, the development of the rules for these environments can only reduce the tension in the sense of disarmament, because we will better understand what is acceptable behavior and what is not laid out in these frameworks. This is also how, let's say, civil aviation is obliged to follow the IKAO rules. question. I agree with my colleague on the rest of the questions. I have nothing to add here. If I haven't caught something, I apologize, but I will be glad to give you additional information if you clarify the questions. Thank you to the panelists for their short but comprehensive answers. I would like to return to the general exchange of opinions, but we still have Pakistan to speak. I want to ask, is it really a very insistent question or could you show flexibility and postpone this question for the second half of the day when we continue the discussion? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This comment is connected to the panelists. If they are still here, I would be glad to ask my question now. Do you have a question for development of your questions or is it a comment? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. No, it's not for development of questions, it's for explanation, because my question was understood incorrectly and the answer did not match my question. So if you allow me, I will clarify it. If the chairman says briefly, then please. What did I say? I did not say at all that... These laws, this right, allow war. I said how these spaces should be regulated. If there are armed attacks, conflicts are triggered, the use of force begins, then... That is, of course, the UN has the priority, Article 2, but all this is violated. That's what I was talking about. That is, we need some other sphere of the rule. We are talking about the operating sphere of the rule and the rule. And here space must remain exclusively for peaceful purposes. How to make space not become... the space where the operating rules will work, where international law will be used well for open space, but how it will contribute to the prevention of arms race, to the PAROS, to the PGVKP, how it will contribute to the PAROS, to the PGVKP, and this is what our group should be engaged in. That is, we must think and discuss precisely in the direction of the Paros, the BGVCP. This is what I was talking about. I meant that it was about the war.",2
S1M767,1,7,Mississippi,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will try. Thank you for the explanation. Dear representative of Pakistan, I'm sorry, I really misunderstood your question from the very beginning. international level, the law is based on the agreement of the states. That is, the states decide. to define some kind of long-term policy, in our case, to leave the cosmos peaceful, so that what is happening there differs from what is happening in the sea and in the air. And in order of explanation, you used, you spoke about exclusively peaceful purposes. Yeah There will be active debates about... in the sphere of the use of this principle of exclusively peaceful goals and how to apply the norms of the usual right. This was said by the panelists before. There are rights. There are principles that define this application.",2
S1M82,1,8,Austria,"President, Austria joins the EU and the contributions by written presentation. We would also like to present a series of considerations under point 5 of the program. a titulo nacional. Agradecemos la creación de este grupo de trabajo, teniendo en cuenta los mayores riesgos y amenazas en el espacio, teniendo en cuenta los beneficios de su uso adecuado en beneficio de todos los países. This work group is a good opportunity to start considering these important challenges. The debate over the past few years has shown that the risks and threats in space are a concern in terms of security for all. We value specifically the inclusion of the current process that allows the participation of all States, which also means an advance. This also gives an advantage to the debates in the disarmament conference. We thank the multi-party participation in this group of work with the participation of commercial entities, NGOs and civil society. It is very valuable. As we have been able to prove these days, we emphasize that the work should not start from scratch. We have to resume the previous work in the field of security in space. and the work groups on the parochial, in the face of the lack of progress in the cd. There have been progress when it comes to considering the peaceful use of space, also a series of peaceful uses. It is important that this work group takes into account the legal basis, norms, principles, and has agreed internationally. Austria is concerned about the situation in space. There are a series of threats and risks, such as greater tensions and risks in terms of security due to the ambition to weaken the capabilities of satellites and also the possibility of the risk of militarization. This would go against the security of all of us, hence we thank the multilateral debate in this working group with the idea of reducing such threats, improving security in space to establish a military-armamentary career in space as a first step. Also, security issues. and also to the rise due to technological advances that will be accelerated in the future. We see a space era with greater dependence on the services provided from the space extraterrestrial, something closely related to our economies, societies and our security, something that deserves maximum protection. The Article 1 of the Space and the Earth Treaty is also collected when it is said that the exploration and use of space must be done in benefit and interest of all countries to be beneficial for all of humanity. The potential behind the evil inter-orbital operations or Earth-Orbita have great repercussions on civilians. They affect transport, communication, energy and health. We follow the argument of the ICRC regarding the possible consequences of conflict in space. Hence the application of the IH in space and its principles of proportionality and precaution. that new entities such as commercial companies are in the space field. The treaty in its Article 6 provides the responsibility of states regarding activities in space. These new realities differ from those existing in 1967, which deserves debate to reach common understandings and solutions. The use of space systems in military conflict increases the risk that these systems are reconfigured with attacks and destruction of objects, or make some useless in the course of military activities in space and on Earth. The counter-spatial capabilities to attack space systems in future conflicts are accompanied by the risk of misunderstanding and escalation. In a situation like this, the rules, principles and rules of conduct are responsible seem more than appropriate and important. In an increasingly congested environment, space waste is a threat to systems. with consequences that can affect space objects and their peaceful use. Also, anti-satellite tests indicate this, as we have recently been able to prove. In this sense, we thank the American Initiative for Prohibition of such tests, as well as the announcement from Canada to do its own thing. This brings together a series of legal issues, such as the inherent risk for objects. civil rights, we would be delighted to continue debating this issue. For example, the application of the 74th Convention on the Registration of Objects. Transparency and confidence measures are important instruments to mitigate some of the risks already indicated, also taking into account the impact of responsible behavior in space. Reinforcing legal and assistance instruments is a necessary step forward as a basis for our additional measures. As the state that ratified all these instruments, we encourage others to do the same, taking back the existing legal frameworks. Also, as it was said, by the Secretary General together with Nakamichi. It is fundamental to have those legal frameworks, even though it is evident that the current ones are insufficient for the new challenges. We will be delighted to see the voluntary measures and also the possibility of reaching binding rules. We are willing to continue to debate it in the mandate of this working group. We will continue to intervene throughout our deliberations throughout this week and also in the face of the future. Thank you.",0
S1M84,1,8,Japan,"Muchas gracias, gracias presidente. Japan considers that the debate on what measures constitute the due consideration or harmful interference and the consultations to the support of Article 9 of the Treaty on Space will generate new rules regarding responsible behavior. As for due consideration, I have a question. What does it imply? What does it mean by due consideration? Or what is included in this concept in the context of space? In that sense, the Philippine Work Document on due consideration is not of interest to us. And very personally, I want to thank the representative of the Philippines for her comments. Article 9 of the Treaty on Space says that the States part... will carry out all their activities with due consideration. If we can reach a common understanding of what is due consideration, even if it is only hypothetically, for example, exchanging information or not carrying out destructive experiments, etc. Pues bien, quizas. Sería posible. that due to consideration, it was a much clearer concept in the special context and the protection of international law. I see certain points in common here between the United States and the Russian Federation, which is... something that we celebrate. When it comes to establishing analogies between the right of the sea and the right of aviation, it could be useful to delve into the debates on the content of the due consideration and not in terms of the disposition. of obligations on emissions. The goal of this work group is to reach a common knowledge of the best way to reduce threats in accordance with resolution 7536 of the General Assembly. That is the debate we are waiting for. We hope that the debate goes in that direction.",2
S1M86,1,8,Germany,"Thank you very much. We reaffirm our support to the principle of due consideration and its full application to strengthen international legal frameworks in force and especially the OST. The application of the due consideration in Article 9 of the OST already exists in international law and an objective should be to ensure that it is supported by a practice of the State to achieve the full objective of this principle. In this context, I want to thank the representative of the Philippines for presenting us with this very interesting work document. We think that requires a common knowledge of what is an acceptable and unacceptable conduct, as a norm regarding which to judge what constitutes the due consideration. In a maritime context, We have had many years, centuries, to get to a common knowledge of what is an acceptable way of operating a boat and what is an unacceptable way. In space we are a bit lagging behind, since space is a new work environment. and we haven't had that much experience. in which to base this common understanding. We think that... La conducta responsable es un enfoque adecuado. The debate on this allows us to see what measures are appropriate to maintain the space as a safe environment and what measures are harmful. It is important to reach a shared evaluation. In what refers to the principle of the due consideration Our work can meet two objectives. The first is the discussion by Professor Auki during his first day of work. That is, the idea that responsible behavior can determine the development of the practices of the States, thus strengthening the treaty on space and the principle of proper consideration in particular. Remembering that the development of voluntary measures differs from the development of a new body of standards at an international level. The second objective of our judgment is to provide practical measures to guarantee a safe space. And in that sense, I want to point out to your attention the proposals that we have made in the report of 2021 to the Secretary General on the conducts responsible in space. First, the idea of a national contact point to reduce conflicts. We think that the spirit of the treaty on space... to respect the due consideration and coordinate the maneuvers, it would be easier if the states could name contact points so that satellite operators can coordinate and... clarify frequencies, clarify questions about traffic, improve coordination and reduce conflicts. Another measure, participation of private space actors. At our judgment, the states have to adopt adequate measures regarding this, also establishing a regulatory framework of supervision so that the actors of private space also demonstrate responsible behavior. We also think that it is important to develop practices to improve transparency and information exchange, to resolve confrontation and conflicts when we talk about private aircraft operations. promoting a change of information about the space situation. And so the States can also have the possibility of attributing activities in space, to apply their legal obligations. Thank you.",2
S1M89,1,8,United States,"Thank you very much, President. I want to make some comments about the excellent presentations this morning. We think we have to do a comparative analysis, as was done this morning. in this work group. Our colleague from UNIDIR highlighted two mechanisms to approach security at sea. the agreement on incidents at sea and the code on unplanned encounters at sea, an agreement that is not legally binding. The United States has signed instruments such as the incident one and is also a member of the Unplanned Encounters Voluntary Code. 21 countries have signed the Unplanned Encounters Code at sea. The incidents at sea, that agreement, is a measure of creating trust. It does not directly affect the size or the structure of a country. These mechanisms, what they do is enhance communication and fix behaviors to reduce the possibilities of accidents by incidents, calculations, calculation errors or other types of errors. Those mechanisms are an example of how specific measures can be made in the military sphere. Mr. President, military aircraft are beginning to interact in space. We have to end the debate on the placement of weapons in space only and also move on to talk about how military aircraft interact in space. For example, when an inspection satellite carries out activities, how can this be done without interfering or with due consideration? In our communication with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Resolution 7536, we ask the States to cooperate with due consideration and in a professional manner. We also ask the international community to work on the best practices to avoid interference with space systems related to security and avoid possible collisions. For this reason, there are excellent examples of the work we could be doing here. There are very similar dispositions between different agreements. For example, there are agreements that talk about ships that watch other ships. It is said that the distance between them must be safe to avoid a risk of collision and that manoeuvres that can put the ships under surveillance in danger must be avoided. This type of activities are the ones that can serve us to learn. to improve the work we are doing here and reduce the risk and threats of military interactions in space. Thank you.",2
S1M811,1,8,Portugal,"Thank you very much to the distinguished representative of the Republic of Korea for your intervention. The distinguished representative of Portugal has the floor, please, ma'am. Muchas gracias, presidente, por habernos dado la palabra. As those who have preceded me in the use of the word, I also want to thank our panelists this morning very warmly. Mrs. Ortega, Mr. Totler, thank you for your contribution and for giving us material for this afternoon. Portugal wants to thank all the delegations who have presented work documents to this session, to this work group, other speakers who have intervened this afternoon. I want to ask some questions. a nuestros colegas. The document of the Philippines says that the due consideration, and I quote, is the legal obligation of all states. It is said that this imposes obligations due diligence to the states above the conduct of their nationalities and boats. For this I would like to be guided in this interpretation. What concrete measures? Do you have the mind to put this legal obligation in place to implement it? It is an obligation that, in its judgment, is for all marine actions. Oh, Bada. Los Estados con registro. Thank you in advance for your comment, for your answer.",2
S1M813,1,8,Philippines,"Thank you very much, President. I want to thank my colleague from Portugal for the question and for putting me in a tight spot. I believe that the obligation of due consideration applies to all States. Part of what is consecrated in Article 9. As for the obligation of due diligence, we think that this is an inherent principle to the principle of due consideration. If we take as a guide the evolution of this principle and the normative evolution of the state practices, the jurisprudence of the law of the sea, for example, well, I want to refer to the consultative opinion of the international court on the law of the sea in reference to the evolution that led to the manifestation of the due consideration. as a concept that had two organizational principles. In the first place, it is an obligation that the states demand to take into account the interests and rights of others, but this is not a negative obligation. Also... There are actions that are considered because the ships of a state comply with the principle of due consideration. This comes from the normative evolution of the concept of due consideration in the right of the sea. And this should serve the group as a guide when clarifying the application of due consideration in the context of space. As for the question of whether we have in mind or not. specific obligations due to diligence? Well, this should be clarified in the course of our work. I am not in a position to give concrete examples, but I would be delighted to continue talking. to see how specific cases of due diligence can be identified in the context of the evolution of the due consideration in the right of the sea. To answer the question, this applies to all States, partly to the OST and not only to the maritime nations. This includes the state of the register, for example, of the space objects.",2
S1M815,1,8,Australia,"Thank you very much. In your communication with the Secretary General last year, Australia listed a number of principles that could help in the debate. of responsible behaviors, for example, the principle of risk reduction, establishing a practical application regarding the concepts of due consideration, harmful contamination and harmful interference, as it appears in the OST and act accordingly. With this in mind, we would like to thank... The Distinguished Delegate of the Philippines, for his work document on Debt of Consideration. It is based on definitions on the right of the sea and helps clarify this concept in the space. It also serves to better understand the interpretation of Debt of Consideration in the sense of Article 9 of the OST. We will give Debt of Consideration to this document and we will provide our perspectives at the moment. Thank you.",2
S1M817,1,8,China,"Muchas gracias, presidente. It's not the first time we've intervened, but it's the first time I'm intervening, so I want to thank you, President, and your team. And thank you to the Secretariat for all the work you've done so far. At the same time, we want to thank the two panelists for their presentations this morning. As usual, I've learned a lot from listening to the exhibitions. in reference to the topic that we are dealing with. I want to say two things. First, the right to the sea. and its applicability. I don't intend to be an expert on this subject, but... When talking about this right of its applicability, there is something that comes to mind. the differentiation between the space and, for example, the right to aviation. There are more things that separate them than things that unite them. That on one hand, on the other. A very general comment. In this three-day debate. which has been an honor for me to listen to. I consider it. that have increased in those knowledge about the subject. We can never forget the goal of this work group, to avoid the armamentist race in space. That's why our debates should focus even more on to prevent the arms race in space and to contribute to the stoppage. Thank you.",2
S1M819,1,8,Canada,"President, thank you. I will begin by praising the quality of the deliberations this week, as well as the excellent presentations and the questions from the delegations. I represent the PloShare projects. and the POWASCH group that commit to abolishing mass destruction weapons and have a broad tradition of dialogue between organizations that support the work to achieve official weapons control mechanisms in the extraterrestrial space. Also with our enthusiastic participation in the development of principles, rules and rules of responsible behavior as a contribution to the OSOM strike. Also, taking into account common interests of all, I would also like to add more elements to the debate in the course. First of all, the rules and the control of weapons. The rules of conduct are fundamental for the stop. Tabus has been discussed in... a series of moments. Many times they are at the bottom of the arms control, in their agreements, also the convention of chemical weapons and they serve. to restrict the use of nuclear weapons, taboos and norms that are closely related to limit or to make the responsible behavior that should not go further. A good control of weapons in space requires that these limitations be properly determined. With respect to the parishes, we can take into account the armamentary career, which is not limited to the weapons themselves. It is fundamentally a matter of conduct, which is why avoiding the armamentary career requires paying attention not only to the capabilities, but also to the conducts. by reducing the opportunity for unintentional climbing or wrong perceptions. The rules can also serve to limit potentially pernicious activities and promote conducts that contribute to mutual security and long-term. Secondly, rules of conduct linked to capacities and vice versa. When talking about conducts in space, it is also about talking about capacities and rules that determine how they are used. and regulate them, depending on their uses and effects. It is a common formula in weapons control. For example, once again, the Convention on Chemical Weapons, which prohibits the use of any chemical product, as long as it is a weapon, or the Convention on Environmental Modification, which prohibits the use of capacities that have serious, lasting and generalized effects on the environment. It is also important to recognize that there is a series of capacity without imposing restrictions to use for peaceful purposes. Also, behavior rules when it comes to complementing the rules in the field of international law. Having a common commitment to the application of international law in space, also in the IH, is a way that allows to reinforce the law. including all the elements related to the restriction of weapons. For example, the application of the D.I.H., emerging technologies, in relation to artificial intelligence, which is used in the field of autonomous weapons. By articulating the different considerations and principles that emanate from international law, the working group has created a solid foundation to move towards the development of norms, principles that collect the peaceful use of the outside space in the benefit of all. the consideration of taking international consultations into account in case of harmful interference, avoiding harmful contamination to the environment and protecting civilians and their civil rights in space. Also, more measures to have definitions on these principles, taking into account also a series of elements to achieve common norms with adequate mechanisms to promote the desired behavior and promote practices. We will talk more about this tomorrow. We have already evaluated it throughout this week, but for example, considerations such as the pre-notification, better registration and information, data exchange, We know what to do, but we have to get the mechanisms running. For more information, I encourage you to publish the document published by UNIDIR, which I wrote in collaboration with Almudena Azcárate. First of all, I would like to ask you to step down for progress, instead of inaction. If we continue without doing anything about this, the result will be nothing. It will be misconduct, bad rules, and very possibly conflict, whether we want it or not. Thank you very much to the representative of the KUASH group for your intervention. More interventions by civil society, non-governmental entities.",2
S1M820,1,8,Secure World Foundation,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. As this is the first time that the Secure World Foundation in the use of the word, we would like to congratulate you on your nomination, Mr. Leader. We wish you all the best in your work. We are at your disposal to give you our support. We also want to thank the Member States for allowing us to intervene here today. Our foundation is a private group that is dedicated to the sustainable and safe use of the space of the world, we collaborate with governments, NGOs, the sector, the academic field and civil society to promote international cooperation in order to achieve a sustainable and safe use of the space of the world. Thus, we thank the creation of this work group and its mandate to present recommendations on possible rules, rules and in relation to the threats posed by the States to the space systems. It is an ingrained effort, but it is all the achievements that are made in this area. We have seen throughout this week that space systems are fundamental for contemporary society and their loss would have devastating consequences for the economy and world security, those activities in space. As we have seen recently, the anti-missile tests can bring great results. of the effects that could put into action the use of space activities with greater risks for an environment already full of dangers, with more difficulties for the operation in the space extraterrestrial for all the entities there present. We consider that there are no anti-satellite evidence responsible in this area. President, we appreciate the recent announcement from the United States when it came to committing to banning anti-satellite weapons tests. It is a good step forward, but there had hardly been any progress in the last decades. It is also a sensitive issue. These tests create residues that affect everyone, also the part that performs the tests. They can also be verified easily. We call on other countries, especially those that also perform these types of anti-semitic weapons tests, to make similar commitments. We encourage this working group, which includes its deliberations, the possibility of working a moratorium on this. Prohibition. Let us thank the words of Canada when it comes to adding this type of prohibition of evidence. It could also serve us in this work in the face of an instrument linked to the international community to work also in order to verify future agreements. Sensitivity around space, a whole period for many countries since decades ago. And also, supervision of space activities is collected there. those capabilities could serve as a basis for a verification regime, for the prohibition of anti-satellite tests or other agreements on irresponsible conduct in space. It is fundamental to consider these capacities with the stipulations of an agreement, ensuring that all parties can consider their own verification capacities, taking into account also their own internal capacities or the reliable access of this type in the commercial sphere. A regime that would look better by publishing some of the existing data. It would also be appropriate to talk about agreements that provide clarity on certain interactions between military satellites that could increase conflict, give place to conflict. It is about developing a multilateral space version as was done between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, taking into account the acceptable conducts for operations of approximation and encounter, and, as much as possible, provide future notifications of activities to reduce the possibilities of wrong perceptions, thus guaranteeing greater security. Also, space entities have to change their perspectives on how current laws are applied something that we have already started to value this week here. We also consider that this group must also determine what the international community that considers this as responsible behavior in the general sense can do, encourage that responsible behavior in space. It must begin by understanding all properly what that responsible behavior means and what irresponsible or threatening behavior in orbit means. Establishing such a distinction will make it possible for the international community to surja o al menos determinar cuándo una conducta es amenazadora o cuándo se hace de manera deshonesta o maligna. Nuestra Fundación le desea a usted y a todos los Estados miembros todo género de éxitos en este debate. Insistimos en que estamos aquí a su disposición para ayudarles en la manera en que ustedes estimen oportuna. Gracias.",0
S1M92,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for that invitation. Apologies for the technical difficulties while still in person, which is rather unfortunate. Thank you for the invitation. We're very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to these discussions. Under the broader subject of voluntary mechanisms, I was asked to discuss how agreed transparency and confidence building measures, or TCBMs, can be better applied to address threats arising from state behaviors with respect to outer space. The first part of my presentation will highlight the significance of TCBMs for this working group and the second part will focus on steps to effectively utilize TCBMs to address threats in space. Distinguished delegates and representatives, TCBMs have been referred to several times over the last week. These are tools to facilitate information sharing and communication. We know they can lower the risks of misunderstanding, miscalculation, and possible escalation. These are voluntary measures, but they can be tailored to meet preferences and circumstances. They can be precursors to advancements in space security governance, laying the foundation for non-binding norms, legally binding norms, and legally binding treaties. Notably, they are not limited to multilateral, bilateral, or regional forms, but can also be adopted on a unilateral basis. TCBMs are especially useful because they can help stakeholders arrive at shared end goals for space security. While states may agree on the need for measures in space security governance, there are different elements that we're seeing that are being articulated, such as conflict prevention, mitigating the impacts of conflict, and restraining arms-racing behaviors. While these goals are similar, they do focus on different elements. TCBMs can help better understand and communicate these differences, helping us arrive at a shared outcome. Importantly, TCBMs are also behavior-oriented. and aligned with the approach of this open-ended working group and resolutions 7536 and 76231. The 2013 GGE report on TCBMs remains one of our most comprehensive sources for measures in space today. It provided definitions, laid out categories, listed criteria to test the implementation of TCBMs, and many of the proposed measures still have the potential to address threats in space today. Some of those measures are... sharing information on space objects and orbital events, information on uncontrolled reentry of space objects, enhancing registration practices, forecasts for natural hazards and space weather, and information exchange. However, these measures were not only proposed in the 2013 GGE report, but were also adopted as specific guidelines in the guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, an instrument which was notably adopted by consensus in 2019. This demonstrates that there are still apprehensions around the measures of TCBMs, which are resulting in the reluctance to act. Addressing some of these concerns today, TCBMs are not an end in and of themselves, but simply a means of progressing these discussions. Adopting such measures do not indicate a preference for the form of an instrument, but can build foundations for both norms and treaties. Indeed, if we are to eventually seek consensus on a treaty, then collectively adopting voluntary measures can bring us to that point. next addressing the concern that transparency may expose states and render them vulnerable to adversaries. While this concern is understandable, it is important to note that based on the type of information, in many instances, there may already be partial open source data about a state's activities, policies, or expenditure. And so by sharing information on their own, states have an opportunity to accurately inform discussions instead of reference to piecemeal information. which results in factually incorrect views and misdirecting discussions in multilateral and national fora. Notably, TCBMs can also allow states to individually benefit. These measures can directly support the growth of a national space sector. For example, information sharing on national policies, strategies, military spending. Disclosing this data can prevent wasteful expenditure and unnecessary acquisitions. instead ensuring adequate resource allocation that aligns with the state's priorities. There are several different types of space activities and ambitions which differ across states and they may involve different departments of the state. And so by sharing this information, this can help facilitate coordination across different departments resulting in a singular, coherent and unified position. This will be essential to support the growth of the domestic space sector, especially from a commercial standpoint. Transparency, particularly information sharing in this manner, can contribute to both national and international space security. It is not necessary that these two are mutually exclusive. For this reason, states are urged to consider the benefits of TCBMs, especially the benefits of enhanced transparency. Moving to steps that we could take to effectively adopt these measures, firstly, correcting our narrative and framing. It must be emphasized that TCBMs are also unilateral. and can simultaneously be adopted in simultaneously with multilateral mechanisms. There is a dominant narrative that TCBMs can only be adopted on this multilateral basis and this framing is subconsciously reflected in our current documents. The use of information exchange indicates that there is an external expectation, some form of reciprocity that is required for another state or states to participate. We must rethink and correct this framing. identify what data can be categorized as information sharing, that is, what types of data can be unilaterally disclosed, and what data must be categorized as information exchange, requiring improvement and use of our existing multilateral mechanisms. To some extent, states do share information on a unilateral basis through space policies, white papers, doctrines, or strategies. We need widespread engagement to expand the level of participation in these practices and consider the type of information that can be disclosed. Moving to multilateral, regional or bilateral information exchange, we must focus on improving the existing mechanisms in the space treaties. As discussions over the last week, even yesterday, have indicated, the space treaties, particularly the outer space treaty, provide provisions for such information exchange. What is lacking is not the mechanisms themselves, but a common understanding on interpretation. For example, previously agreed TCBMs proposed the use of consultation mechanisms, including those prescribed by Article 9. But in the absence of a shared understanding of the terminology and the thresholds of Article 9, this mechanism is unlikely to be used. We have similar differences regarding registration if registration occurs at all. And so to take TCBMs forward, we urge states to reaffirm their commitments to principles in the treaties and then identify the legal gaps therein. especially noting growing state practice. This will allow us to use existing mechanisms to improve accountability. The Milamos and Wumera manuals will aid this process. Milamos is the manual providing the Lex Lata or the law as it is for peacetime, and Wumera clarifies law on use of force and IHL from the perspective of conflict prevention. These manuals provide the basis for transparency and confidence building. It can help us arrive at a shared understanding of existing legal principles. Third, assessing previously agreed measures and considering enhancement when necessary. We must conduct an assessment of these measures in light of threats today. Identify whether these measures need further enhancement and if there are voluntary means to do so while future solutions are deliberated. For instance, a previous recommendation to submit notifications for intentional orbital breakups. Certainly, notifications are a useful tool and statements can convey a state's intentions behind a test. However, since the 2013 GGE report and since the guidelines on long-term sustainability for outer space were adopted, not one but two destructive ASAP tests have been conducted. Another example exhibiting the need for this enhancement for new TCBMs is non-consensual and uncoordinated rendezvous and proximity operations. I raise these examples to exhibit that there is potential to arrive at an agreement on certain behaviors where TCBMs can bridge the pathway to long-term solutions. And finally, exploring new TCBMs. Space Situational Awareness, or SSA, is a promising avenue for cooperation and transparency. It is advisable to consider a mechanism for shared SSA data, where we can provide collective access to orbital data for transparency. If the data is verified and collected by more than one source, this can assuage concerns that reports of activities may be biased or inaccurate. And in this process, we could consider a mechanism that engages different stakeholders in the collection and dissemination of varying sources of data. Notably, non-state actors have great potential to valuably contribute to creating such a mechanism. Engagement of different stakeholders, including industry and civil society, is an opportunity to utilize available technical expertise that supports the creation and implementation of such measures. There have been concerns about how to include such actors in these discussions. However, we should note that these entities possess unique understanding of the technologies themselves and the legal, commercial and policy implications. inclusive and multi-stakeholder approach to space security governance. In conclusion, TCBMs are flexible, voluntary measures that can provide us with the opportunity to support the behavioral approach of this working group. These measures do not indicate a preference for the form of an instrument, but simply provide us with the vehicle that we need to get there. We must seek to improve use of existing mechanisms in the space treaties and aim to arrive at a shared understanding of the thresholds in those provisions. While efforts are dedicated towards multilateral mechanisms for collective reporting, data sharing and communication, states should simultaneously utilize the unilateral nature of TCBMs. Measures do not only need to be external or reciprocity based. States can engage more in national information sharing. This is an opportunity to set an example and engage in best practices. We must acknowledge the benefits that such measures can bring to states, even on an individual basis. as this can significantly support the growth of the domestic and commercial space sector. By undertaking such a collaborative approach that focuses on behaviors, TCBMs can act as interim steps that advance national and international space security governance. We need to spark collective movement towards transparency and confidence building to achieve tangible progress. Thank you.",2
S1M94,1,9,South Africa,"you, Chair. At the outset, allow me to thank you for inviting me to address our open-ended working group here today and to share some insights from my experience of chairing the LTS process in Corpus, in which you, Mr. Chairman, had a number of colleagues in this room today played a very important role. And of course, I had the pleasure of also working with you on the GGE on TCBMs. Allow me also to congratulate you on the outstanding way in which you leading the work of this group in this week. I'm confident that under your excellent leadership in this first session, the open-ended working group will be highly productive and set the scene for fruitful discussions later this year. I've been asked to discuss the potential for voluntary measures, guidelines, and other frameworks developed for the purpose of ensuring the safety and long-term sustainability of outer space activities. to address threats arising from state behaviors with respect to outer space. Let me begin by acknowledging that there's a growing recognition of the need to enhance the governance regime for space activities, particularly as it pertains to the safety and sustainability of space activities. Notably, we're witnessing a growing reliance on space by militaries and consequently a This has given rise to calls from multilateral instruments to address the politically thorny issue of space security. But here, too, discussions on legally binding instruments have become deadlocked, as with many of the other discussions in the CD. In this environment, bottom-up soft law approaches may provide a pragmatic option to make progress in certain areas, particularly where consensus can be achieved on various technical and procedural issues and incorporate it into non-binding standards and guidelines. In passing, I would remark that I think it's a bit of a false dichotomy to have to choose between either legally binding approaches or voluntary soft law instruments. In my view, we will need both types of instruments used in a complementary fashion. Soft law has played a role in guiding the behavior of states before the adoption of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. The first important decision by the UN concerning space law dates back to December 20, 1961, when the General Assembly adopted Resolution 1721 on international cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space. This resolution expresses the foundational principle that international law, including applies to outer space and celestial bodies. And that outer space and celestial bodies are free for exploration and use by all states in conformity with international law and are not subject to national appropriation. The Declaration of Legal Principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space, adopted in 1963 by the General Assembly, reaffirms and expands the scope of the earlier resolution to introduce inter-alia, state responsibility for space activities, the state obligation for authorization and continuing supervision of space activities, the obligation for registration, the notion of a launching state as the basis for all the liability regime for damage, and the obligation for consultation. The Autospace Treaty was essentially a codification of these same principles, which were then further developed in the succeeding space treaties. Soft law can therefore be seen as a first step in achieving more robust binding agreements. One may observe that although soft law instruments are non-binding, this does not mean that they are non-legal. Although soft law may not be legally binding, state actors may regard it as politically binding. States that adopt a soft law instrument may choose to demonstrate their political commitment to the instrument by implementing its provisions in their national regulatory frameworks for outer space activities. Such has been the case in a variety of contexts. For example, a number of states have implemented elements of the UN space debris. mitigation guidelines in their national regulatory processes for the licensing and ongoing supervision of space activities. Soft law instruments can also help states to socialize adherence to technical standards and recommended practices. A number of soft law instruments are bottom-up, technically-based instruments drawn from technical standards and best practice guidelines based on the experiences of states in the safe conduct of space operations. Other states may use these soft law instruments as a basis for enhancing their own national administrative procedures. For example, the provisions contained in these soft law instruments may find expression in national regulatory frameworks for the licensing and supervision of space activities or in legally binding contracts. They may also find expression in cooperation agreements among states, thus helping to internationalize such standards and practices. Even if they are non-binding, soft law instruments really need to be used. to be developed with a broad international mandate of initio if they are not to face legitimacy challenges later on. This broad support takes patience and time to build. This was our experience in UN Corpus where it took several years to socialize the idea among states that there was a need for the committee to address space sustainability with a view to adopting international guidelines. When the idea of space sustainability guidelines was first proposed in Corpus, a number of states were suspicious of the motive behind this initiative, coming at a time when commercial, off-the-shelf components and easier and cheaper access to space were lowering the financial and technological barriers to entry into the space club. We can also look to the development of transparency and confidence building measures, or TCBMs, as a means to enhance space sustainability. The motivation for adopting broadly agreed TCBMs is that states and intergovernmental organizations should implement such TCBMs to the greatest extent practicable. It is therefore important to demonstrate that the proposed measures or actions are applicable to the domain. and the actors and they are implementable, that is, practicable and verifiable by other parties. With regard to this latter point, given their non-binding nature, the report of the GGE on TCBMs notes that TCBMs should complement, but not substitute for, the verification measures of legally binding arms control agreements and regimes. offers a pragmatic possibility to develop a shared understanding of what constitutes a safe and responsible space activities and contributes to a more stable space environment by reducing the risk of miscommunications, misperceptions, and miscalculations. Now one might imagine any number of potential TCBMs, so how do we identify those most likely to make a positive contribution to building trust? and reducing the potential for misunderstandings and misperceptions. In other words, what are the characteristics of a good TCBM? Firstly, a proposed TCBM should be clear, practical, and proven, meaning that both the application and the efficacy of the proposed TCBM have been demonstrated by one or more actors. Secondly, the application of the proposed TCBM should be objectively verifiable by other parties. either independently or collectively. Thirdly, a proposed TCBM should reduce or even eliminate the causes of mistrust, misunderstanding and miscalculation with regard to the activities and intentions of states. So if a TCBM is to be implemented as widely as possible in order to achieve the intended effect, we need to have a clear understanding of what implementation means from several perspectives. It is helpful to consider implementation from the following perspectives. Firstly, who will implement the measure? What exactly is the actual measure or action to be performed or not performed? Why is this beneficial? When is the measure to be performed and how is the measure to be performed? Allow me to elaborate briefly on each of these aspects. Starting with the who. It's important to identify the respective roles of the different actors. These range from those responsible for performing the required task to those responsible for monitoring and reporting. Who should implement the measure? Who will be able to confirm that the measure has been implemented? Moving on to the what. It's necessary to articulate the actual measure or action that is to be performed. A description of the action required should not necessarily be prescriptive, but it should rather indicate what ultimate objective or outcome is desired. In other words, what is the measure that should be implemented? Is it clearly identified and understood? What should be demonstrated to confirm implementation? Moving on then to the why. Clearly, in order to justify a particular measure, it's important to demonstrate the value or benefit of performing an action. Accordingly, it's important to provide an explanation of why it's necessary to perform the action, that is, the rationale. What is the value of performing the measure? Do all relevant actors have a clear understanding of why it's important to be able to confirm or demonstrate implementation? Moving on then to the when. It's important to specify at what point in time an action is to be performed. Is it to be performed on a fixed time scale, for example annually, or relative to certain points in a mission life cycle, for example, in the post mission phase? When should the measure be implemented? At what point is demonstration or confirmation performed? And finally, moving to the how. It's necessary to identify how to implement particular measures, both in terms of the actor and a potential observer. This should address how the activity can be verified. Can the action be independently observed and must it be reported with supporting evidence? How should the measure be implemented? How is the implementation of the measure to be validated, demonstrated or confirmed? We must allow for flexible implementation of TCBMs, as implementation will be consistent with the national capabilities, needs, and state of development of each country. For this reason, it's important to determine what TCBM implementation means in different contexts. This is why voluntary sharing of information on implementation experiences is so helpful. In this regard, I am pleased to see that a number of delegations in COPUS have started to report their implementation experiences for the LTS guidelines. This information sharing helps other states to think about how they might implement the guidelines and it also encourages wider implementation of the guidelines. Improving space situational awareness can help by verifying actions in orbit and by establishing pathways for technical cooperation and data exchange, which lays the groundwork for possible future collaboration and allows for regular communication between space actors. While the notion of verification is usually used with legally binding arms control agreements, there is a place for space situational awareness to verify that the information being shared military and civil space activities is accurate. Several interventions this week have noted the potential for overlap between our discussions here and the work of UN Corpus. So permit me, if I may, to share some thoughts on this overlap. Let me begin by saying that some overlap is inevitable, because as we have repeatedly heard in this session, so much of space activity is dual use in nature. Both here and in Corpus, we are following approaches that focus primarily on encouraging certain behaviors rather than attempting to regulate functions. In Corpus, we're looking at threats to space flight safety and the space environment. And here in this OEWG, we're concerned primarily with threats to the security and stability of space operations. Fully respecting the respective different mandates for addressing the security aspects and the peaceful uses of space in the respective first and fourth committee bodies dealing with space issues, we can nevertheless accept that there will inevitably be a need to coordinate between these two fora because some issues will be cross-cutting. And to give one obvious example, the technologies that support close proximity operations and active debris removal. And I can elaborate on that in the Q&A session. It was probably a good thing for the GGE on TCBMs that about half of the experts in that GGE had direct experience of working in COPUOS, and I believe that enriched our discussions in the GGE. I observe a number of delegates in this OEWG session, including our esteemed chair, who have extensive experience of COPUOS, and I believe that will be a good thing for our efforts. Now, to the linkages between the report of the GGE on TCBMs. and the Corpus LTS guidelines. The COPUOS LTS Working Group was tasked, in its terms of reference, to consider appropriate linkages with the GGE. This was done by the chairs of the two respective processes, providing formal briefings to each other's groups. It's instructive to identify some of the interlinkages between the LTS guidelines and the recommendations in the report of the GGE on TCBMs, as contained in Document A-68-189. The GGE report refers in its paragraph 39 to exchanges of information on orbital parameters of outer space objects and potential orbital conjunctions. Reference is also made to the registration of space objects. The LTS guidelines B1 concerning the exchange of contact information, exchange of data on space objects, guideline B2, and risk assessments relating to space objects address such matters. LTS guideline A5 refers to enhancing registration practice and encourages states to consider providing information on any change of status inter-alia when a space object is no longer functional, and that following a change in supervision of a space object in orbit, information about changes in the orbital position be provided. The guideline also contains recommendations for information to be provided in cases where a launched object contains other space objects planned for future separation and independent orbital flight. This includes the number and names of space objects that may, in the future, separate from the main object and be subsequently registered. The GGE report refers in paragraph 40 to exchanges of information on forecast natural hazards in outer space. LTS guidelines B6 and B7 on sharing of operational space weather data, forecasts, and best practices address this issue. Paragraph 42 of the GGE report refers to notifications relating to scheduled maneuvers that may result in a risk to the flight safety of space objects of other states and to pre-launch conjunction assessment. The LTS guidelines B4 and B5 on the safety of space operations address such matters. Paragraph 43 of the GGE report addresses measures to minimize the risks due to uncontrolled re-entries. LTS guideline B9 addresses this issue. Section 5 of the GGE report refers to international cooperation and touches, inter alia, on international cooperation for capacity building and confidence building. The LTS guidelines C1, C2 and C3 on international cooperation in support of the long-term sustainability and capacity building address such matters. I therefore hope the above examples illustrate the interrelation between the LTS guidelines and the recommendations of the GGE on TCBMs. Indeed, some of the LTS guidelines offer a bottom-up approach to implementing some of the recommendations of the TCBMs in the GGE report. Finally, I would like to end with some concrete examples of what from the Secure World Foundation perspective, could be some low-hanging fruits for actions that could be TCBMs to enhance space security. Firstly, demonstrating commitment to the existing legal framework governing outer space activities, notably signing and ratifying the outer space treaty, registration convention, and liability convention, and registering space objects promptly, including military objects in a timely manner with the UN. Next, providing transparency regarding plans and intentions for space activities, including military ones, such as prior notifications of launches. maneuvers or close approaches where possible. Third, committing to refrain from non-consensual and uncoordinated rendezvous and close proximity operations. Fourth, sharing information about national military policies, budgets and programs pertaining to space. Fifth, following existing best practices for orbital debris mitigation, including for military space activities. declaring a commitment to minimize, as far as practicable, the creation of long-lived orbital debris in the course of normal space operations. Next, declaring a commitment not to carry out activities that intentionally generate large amounts of orbital debris. In this regard, we believe the recently announced U.S. commitment not to conduct any further direct ascent destructive ASAT tests in orbit is a step in the right direction. We note that throughout the course of this week, a number of delegations have expressed their appreciation for this commitment by the United States. and we applaud Canada announcing a similar clear commitment at this meeting. In our view, the declaratory value of such a commitment not to perform destructive direct ascent anti-satellite tests is not dependent on whether a country has already developed such a capability or is close to having such a capability in order to make such a declaration meaningful. a declaration, states affirm that in their sovereign assessment, the intentional creation of orbital debris through performing tests, such tests, can no longer be considered a responsible use of space because there is an ever increasing number of states and non-governmental entities that rely on space systems and space services which are vulnerable to the debris caused by such tests. We therefore call on other nations to consider making similar commitments and to work together to establish this as an emerging norm of responsible behavior. This is one of the ways in which the international community can identify this as an emerging norm. Space sustainability and security are intrinsically multilateral challenges, because no single actor or group of like-minded actors can ensure the safety and security of their space activities entirely through their own efforts. These challenges can only be addressed successfully if all countries act collectively. Developing a shared understanding of what constitutes safe and responsible space activities contributes to a more stable space environment. by reducing the risk of miscommunication, misperceptions, and miscalculation. This OEWG is an important step towards this goal to ensure that the space environment is preserved and protected for use by all nations for peaceful purposes and for future generations. And with that, I would like to conclude my remarks and I look forward to the discussion to follow. But just before closing, I would like to take this opportunity through you, Mr. Chairman. to inform distinguished delegates that Secure World Foundation will be hosting the fourth Summit for Space Sustainability together with our partners, the UK Space Agency, in London on the 22nd and 23rd of June, and we would warmly welcome the attendance of all interested OEWG delegates. Postcards with more information on this summit are available in the back of the room. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S1M96,1,9,United Kingdom,"Good morning, all. Thank you very much for the comments from the panelists this morning. This working group was set up by the UN General Assembly under the agenda item of preventing an arms race in outer space. You've both focused very usefully and helpfully on safe space operations and the TCBMs from from other forums and how we might bring those into this conversation about an arms race in outer space. We've been told by previous presenters that there is the ability to soft kill a satellite or to interrupt signals. Do you have examples, please, of TCBMs or similar instruments that could manage dazzling or electronic warfare satellites rather than... just focusing on satellite to satellite operations, sort of safe space operations. Perhaps we could take this again and draw on your expertise as to how we might link this to Paros. Thank you. I thank the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom for his question, and I give the floor back to the panelist, Mrs. Rajudu. Do you have something to say?",2
S1M97,1,9,Stockholm,"Sorry, yes, thank you, Chair. Thank you for the excellent question. I think in that sense, I would refer to some of the discussions that we've had over the last week as well. And when it comes to different forms of electronic interference that you've mentioned, jamming, even dazzling for that matter, non-kinetic means, I think that we would have to go to the root of the matter in the Outer Space Treaty and go back to Article 9. And this is one of the points that I raised in my presentation as well. I believe that Article 9 is quite a chunky provision. There's a lot in there. And we don't all seem to agree on exactly what those terms mean. So when it comes to the definition of harmful interference, I think that this is an area which we can focus our efforts towards and gain some legal clarity on what those thresholds should be. And I also believe that in terms of seeking some consensus on definitions, this forum is the ideal means to do so, and this very much directly ties in with the work of Paros. And once again, I believe that to achieve this, we would need an interdisciplinary approach that includes both legal and technical expertise. I think that this would be important to understand exactly how the technologies work. And this is also why the manuals will be both Mulemos and WMERA that I mentioned earlier, because it is unclear as to what exactly amounts to an attack when it comes to non-kinetic means of interference and non-kinetic counter space capabilities. When it comes to other such modes, does there need to be physical destruction? Does there need to be continuous attacks for this to reach that threshold? These are the kinds of questions that we need to discuss. Thank you.",2
S1M99,1,9,South Africa,"Thank you. Well, Nivedita did such an excellent job of answering the questions. She touched on all the points I would have referred to, so I have nothing further to add.",2
S1M911,1,9,Germany,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. We have two questions. The first question, I think both panelists emphasize that there's room for both TCBMs and legally binding instruments, and to an extent they are complementary or preparatory to each other. My question is, where would you see that TCBMs bring a unique added value compared to a legally binding instrument, and can you give us criteria for such kind of TCBM? and what kind of TCBMs would be in a way a preparatory step to illegally binding instruments and how would you characterize them by comparison. And the second question is, you both mentioned in a safety field we made a lot of progress with the LTS and debris mitigation guidelines. So my question is what can we learn from the process how these guidelines were negotiated for our work here?",2
S1M913,1,9,South Africa,"Thanks to the distinguished delegate of Germany for that question. So with regard to which TCBMs would bring value, thinking of in terms of pragmatic, low-hanging fruit, I think looking at TCBMs on close proximity operations would be a good place to start. And this is a good opportunity for me to refer back to a point that I alluded to. in my statement, it was interesting that during the negotiation of the LTS guidelines in the early years, it wasn't possible to have a conversation about active debris removal because there was a concern that the underlying technologies had a dual use potential and so therefore a number of delegations argued that was not a matter for discussion and COOPWAS, that it should be addressed in the CD. And that is why you will not find an LTS guideline that addresses this issue. However, the private sector, academic institutions and so on, are not waiting for the UN to develop such guidelines. They are developing, planning, and executing such missions in orbit already. And so this is an example of how issues sometimes fall between the stools of the two UN fora. And I believe that... in the next phase of the LTS guideline discussions that this issue will be amongst those addressed. In terms of the process of negotiating the guidelines and valuable lessons, I think one of the reasons for the successful outcome of the LTS discussions was that they were a technically based bottom-up approach that we used. We did not get stuck in definitional debates at the outset. We identified all of the elements that delegations thought or agreed were relevant, constituent elements of space sustainability. And then we gathered those into four categories of related topics, which were addressed by a number of expert groups. These were technical and legal experts. These expert groups were deliberative fora, not decision-making fora, and the expert groups proposed candidate guidelines, and where there was sufficient consensus among the experts that there was an established practice sufficient to recommend an international guideline, these guidelines were put forward. The expert groups operated by consensus but did not actually take any decisions, those decisions were reserved for the working group itself. But this expert group approach that we used, I think, was one of the reasons why the first tranche of 12 of the 21 guidelines that were adopted in 2016 emerged out of that expert process. And so I believe that was one successful lesson that we learned in the development of the LTS guidelines. And I don't know whether there is scope for a similar kind of expert approach in the work to be done here. I'll stop and allow my colleague on the panel to add her contribution.",2
S1M915,1,9,Stockholm,"Ms. Raju. Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the questions. On the first point, I would say that... To ensure that we're not, that we're still utilizing the power of TCBMs, they would need to be brought to the center of our discussions. Even the states which have mentioned them, even in their reports and their working papers, a lot of delegations seem to be referring to them as an additional measure. But if we want to utilize this to take steps forward, both for non-building and for legally binding treaties, they need to be brought to the center and they need to be the focus of our discussions. Regarding criteria that is laid out in the 2013 report, which Peter touched on in his presentation as well, and specific measures, I would point to Part 4C of the 2013 report and Part 6 in particular, which focus on risk reduction notifications and consultation mechanisms. I believe that these tie in directly, again, with the work of Paros, and these are issues that we could focus on. And regarding the process, I just wanted to also add on to what Peter said. And I believe that we would need to be very clear about our scope and ensure that our process has a clear mandate and is as inclusive as possible to ensure that it does not only cater to a group of states and we must have Interdisciplinary expertise legal and technical expertise is very welcome But from other backgrounds as well the commercial sector should also have we should have an understanding of what their priorities are because they will feed into these discussions to the commercial sector has a from every state has a very great stake in ensuring transparency because stability is in their business interests for operation as well. Thank you.",2
S1M917,1,9,Italy,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to thank the panelists for the very useful and interesting presentations. Italy, indeed, highlighted the importance of TCBMs and especially those suggested by the 2013 GGE on TCBMs in outer space activities in its contribution to the report of the UN Secretary General following Resolution 7536. I would like to ask the panelists. whether our work can also be on the core principles suggested by the 2015 report of the GGE on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, especially in relation to non-kinetic threats, especially cyber attacks and their potential consequences on space assets. Thanks.",2
S1M919,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you for the question and thank you, Chair. I believe that it is important. We could definitely utilize the information and the report. However, when it comes to non-kinetic threats, there is, it can supplement our discussions, but once again, we would need to go back to the principles that we have in our treaties. This is of course my legal bias and that is my background, but I believe there is much to clarify starting from those mechanisms and that needs to be our starting point. And certainly we must look at the technological developments and how technology feeds into it, but we're not going to understand how to further propose new regulations or new measures if we don't know how to work with the ones that we already have. I hope that answers your question. Thank you.",2
S1M921,1,9,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask a couple of questions to the reporters. First of all, I would like to thank them for such interesting and complete reports. I am glad to hear the ideas that we will definitely consider in preparation for our meeting, for our participation in the... of the open-company group and also of participation in other professional areas. The first question I would like to address to the respected expert from India. It was an important issue in our opinion, the increase in the state's awareness of the situation in space. and the idea was that it is very important to have a part in this work of non-governmental structures of the commercial sector which could present data about the situation in space. In this regard, I have a question. The group of government experts on the further measures to prevent the arms race in space presented a presentation that showed that there are at least four systems of tracking the situation in space. and these systems, unfortunately, do not correlate with each other. That is, the data they provide does not match at all, is prepared based on various algorithms. I think that the participation of non-governmental groups will bring an additional... The commercial structures will develop their own systems for tracking the situation in space. The presence of these various systems will seriously raise the issue of providing the first fullness of such data. Second, the reliability of such data. Third, the applicability of such data. And the timeliness of such data. Because without taking into account all these conditions, all these characteristics of information about the situation in space, it is impossible to apply it. In some cases it is simply dangerous. because it can lead to wrong interpretation, wrong understanding of the space situation. Russian Federation the United States. Nevertheless, the creation of such a platform, in our opinion, would help to solve the problem of providing full, reliable, applicable and timely data on the space situation. I have a short question, actually. It was a comment. The question is, what mechanisms do you think can solve the issue of providing these four important characteristics of information about the space situation? This was a question for the respected expert from India. I have a question for Mr. Peter Martinez, who for a long time was the chairman of the working group on long-term stability of space activity. Uhhh... I would like to know his opinion about the compatibility of the measures of voluntary nature, such as the leadership principles, measures of transparency and trust, possible norms and rules of responsible behavior. How should they relate to the current international space law? and international law in general. What consequences can the production of the norm of the rule of the will of the character, which goes beyond the framework of the current international law? And can they even go beyond the framework of international law? According to the Russian Federation, we are convinced that any voluntary measures should be based on the current international law, including international space law, those lacuna that exist in this current rule until the legally obligatory decisions are made on this account. But there are certain problems in space activity or caused by space activity, which may require a broader view than the current international space law. It is important to understand this compatibility, where is the boundary of the applicability of voluntary measures. Thank you.",2
S1M923,1,9,Iran,"Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to appreciate and thank both panelists. I have maybe no question but rather a comment that has to do with the issue of LTS. in the context of the CUPUS actually. I appreciate comment made by Mr. Martinez. He has been doing almost until that 21 guidelines and voluntary guidelines as well as the preambular part adopted in the CUPUS context. So far as the LTS is concerned, we believe that it is not a project rather it is a process. process that it is in the elementary step as yet so far that the working group just recently has adopted the terms of reference method of work and work plan. So far from the adopting of the method of work and work plan, it was indicated that at least developing countries have a lot of difficulty and challenges implementing the some of those guidelines. Of course, in the guideline there are parts related to the international cooperation, capacity building and technology transfer. From the discussion of the working group, it was clear that there are two schools of thoughts, one belonging to developed countries, which are mostly may interpret guidelines from the national standpoint that they have national legislation in this regard and they are trying to recommend them as a best practice to other side of the country. countries so far. At the same time, developing countries have a lot of challenges and they think that it should be those challenges addressed in the context of international cooperation, capacity building and technology transfer. So far as the LTS in the context of the Kupus is concerned, we think that it is yet very premature to take the LTS guideline as a pattern that to reduce the space threats in terms of the responsible or irresponsible behavior so far. works to be done and we are not yet to what extent those guidelines which are very voluntary to could succeed in the very genuine objectives that they have been created for. From the discussion of the Kupus unfortunately we had not very good impression when we have discussed that the international cooperation and should be addressed very carefully in that context. Therefore, we believe that this pattern of LTS unless and until that the concerns of the developing countries should be genuinely addressed by developing countries would not be very good pattern or... benchmark I could say to be used in the context of the Paris so far. Maybe Mr. Martinez explained to us to what extent that the parts related to international cooperation and capacity building in the context of those guidelines being very challenges and time consuming and painstaking negotiation had happened in that context. of the Kupu LTS for current discussion we have and maybe... implementation of the guidelines would not be a very good example if still the intention of developed countries is that they do not take very seriously the issue of international cooperation and capacity building and technology transfer. Thank you.",2
S1M925,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you, and thank you for the opportunity to respond as well. And yes, correcting a mistake earlier, I am not a delegate from the Indian delegation. I am Indian, but here representing SIPRI based in Stockholm. I believe that this is a very valid point about the concerns of developing states. And I somehow think that there is still scope for this to directly feed into the work of Paros as well, because through information sharing as a TCBM, as I mentioned earlier, in particular, information sharing on national information sharing here on a unilateral basis for national space policies, activities, and military space expenditure. I believe this would cause developing countries to coordinate across different departments. And since there are many departments involved in space activities, this coordination, this facilitation will help benefit the domestic space sector. And from this aspect, and this is one such TCBM that can actively be pursued, which is very much in the interests and addresses the concerns of developing countries and feeds into the work of this group and Paros as well. Thank you very much. Peter. I thank the distinguished delegate from Iran for his excellent and very pertinent remarks on the importance of capacity building for implementation of the LTS guidelines. When we were developing these guidelines, we were mindful that space activities are organized, regulated, and carried out in very different ways in different countries. And this is why we weren't prescriptive. The guidelines are not prescriptive in terms of their implementation. It's to acknowledge the fact that space activities are regulated and conducted in a very different fashion in different countries. But there is a full section of the LTS guidelines. a category of the guidelines that is all about international cooperation and capacity building. And that section, in my mind, as the former chair of the process and as a person from a developing country, myself, is just as important as the sections on building national regulatory capacity and the guidelines on space safety. In this regard, I think that the voluntary sharing of information... on guideline implementation experience in corpus is extremely helpful. I am very pleased to see that a number of states have started to present quite candidly their implementation experiences, which I think will be helpful for other countries to our, perhaps have less experience in the conduct and regulation of space activities to unpack what the guidelines mean. There's a lot of... information, material contained within those guidelines. So for example, the registration practice and the recommendation on enhanced registration contained in the LTS guidelines, that's quite a process in itself and I can give other examples. So we think that... The experiences of sharing implementation experience of the guidelines in COPULS may help discussions elsewhere in the UN system and perhaps in fora like this. And I would also like to say that I would see information sharing and capacity building not only as a transparency and confidence building measure but also as evidence of responsible behavior in spaces. as well, that's part of being a responsible space actor. Thank you.",2
S1M928,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you to the delegation of Sweden for the questions. Regarding low-hanging fruits, well, I think that this has again come up over discussions over the last week. And we've seen this based, welcoming the statements of the U.S. and Canada on destructive ASAT testing. We can see that there is an appetite for this issue. However, we need to first agree on what the scope and the process and the outcome of this should be and ensure that this is an inclusive process and is not inclusionary in any way and under the proper mandate. Pursuing a measure in this form, I think, would be this is low-hanging fruit, and several references have been made to this in the past. I think that this is one of those priorities. At the national level, I think more commitment to sharing policies is also very, very useful. And establishing national points of contacts, possible hotlines in case of an accidental escalation on a bilateral basis, that would also be very useful. And capacity building on – even on a regional basis, which ties in with the comment made by the delegation of Iran earlier as well. Considering regional TCBMs also, I think, is something that we should engage more actively with. On the second question on technology development, I believe we are all in agreement here that this has been a challenge with space law. The developments are far outpacing that of our mechanisms in the in our treaties. We can draft TCBMs and adopt them in a way that they are flexible, and we can have a follow-up mechanism, certainly. Perhaps... This will also ensure that states are committing to actively implementing them. And regular meetings after the adoption of these measures would be very useful to ensure that they're still relevant, addressing the most urgent and current threats, and that we're doing our best to keep up with implementation in light of these technologies.",2
S1M931,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you, Chair, and thank you. That's an excellent question. Thank you to the Japanese delegation. Regarding the references to the Code of Unplanned Encounters and for HCOC, certainly these are excellent examples that we should use for notifications, and we can draw on this to build our TCBMs for space, as we have already in the previous report. But as I mentioned earlier, we also see that the frequency notifications for intentional orbital breakups, for instance, since these tests are increasing, we need to maybe further enhance notifications with another measure, which is what I mentioned in my last response. In terms of incentivizing TCBMs, I believe that in this sense, we have not really fully grasped how transparency is in all of our interests. and that if we do not utilize TCBMs to move forward, it's going to be a destabilizing environment for all of us. And everyone suffers to, everyone will negatively suffer the impact of that, especially from a financial and commercial standpoint. And bearing this in mind, we should be much more proactive than we are now. And this is also why I believe involving the non-state actors directly entities who are engaged in these activities in space. and hearing from them about why it's in their interest and why transparency is so essential, that would be a key part of that conversation and I hope would incentivize more action on TCBMs. Thank you.",2
S1M933,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the delegation of Cuba for the questions. On the first point about making sure that we do not collide with the – with Copius, I am in complete agreement. There is no need to replicate the work, but we can simply bridge them together. We must be aware of the discussions in both the fora, and here we can focus on the measures that would be directly relevant to space security governance from the perspective of Paros. And in this regard, I believe we can focus on specific measures and specific TCBMs. In regards to debris, that does fall more within the mandate of the copious forum, but I would like to provide maybe a more concrete example about how we could do this, how we could manage both forums. And I would like to talk about rendezvous and proximity operations, which my co-panelists mentioned earlier. The governance regime for RPOs is being discussed at COPUOS at this time. However, from a TCBM's perspective, we could in the meantime have states commit to share information on scheduled maneuvers. We could in the meantime have states commit to notify and commitment to notify by the approaching state. These are measures that we can very much develop through this working group and would be extremely essential I believe to overall security and stability. On the point of soft law, I respectfully disagree and I would argue that there are instances of soft law even crystallizing into hard law, both under space law and under international law as well. The articles of state responsibility are now codified as custom, which are a hard source. And the outer space treaty itself is a binding treaty. There are clear obligations under them, but we have differences as to their interpretation. And so, again, through the work of this group, clarifying those provisions, I believe, would be a key starting point and something that we can focus on through this group. Regarding a court or authority, I believe we're still a bit far from that discussion. And in my opinion, these should be our immediate steps forward. I hope that helps.",2
S1M935,1,9,Austria,"Chair, for giving me the floor. I have, in fact, two questions. The first one is to Ms. Raju. And the question is about what she already has touched upon. existing outer space treaties and underexplored or not used, not implemented, or let's say mechanisms where we don't have enough common understandings about, as she mentioned, Article 9 or Article 11 of the outer space treaty. She also mentioned some of the other outer space treaties and maybe she could expand upon a little, are there other mechanisms where we could look... for better common understandings, where there are mechanisms that already exist and that we could use in a better or more comprehensive way. And the second question is it's building upon something interesting than one of the speakers yesterday mentioned about technical solutions for identification. And here we will be interested in the views of both panelists on possible technical solutions with by using new technology for TCBMs. And here, probably the issue of rendezvous and proximity operations would be something where this could be a solution or an idea or something, at least technologically, we could look into. Thank you.",2
S1M937,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you Chair and thank you for the questions. These are again really excellent questions. Considering the provisions under the outer space treaty that are not fully explored, going back to Article 9, I would say that there is no real understanding of what the term consultation means. And this apologies for sounding repetitive. I understand this has been raised a lot over the last week. But we don't really share an understanding of what the word means. Does a consultation mean a notification? It can't because it implies that there is some requirement to engage with experts. So in this case, would we need to maybe interpret consultation as a way of reassuring other states that the activity in question is not going to have consequences that would harm other interests? Maybe this is a way of interpreting it. But this is simply from the plain meaning of the word consultation. But this is just an example of the discussions that we need to have. And under Article 11, informing the Secretary-General, informing the public, this is a way of using this mechanism more broadly for states, as I mentioned earlier, on a unilateral basis to disclose data and information. I would also like to maybe mention two of the other space treaties as well and the issues that we need to focus on in those. Registration has been mentioned by my co-panelist as well. There are still some issues that we need to resolve in this sense. We're seeing a lot of activity in space and we're seeing many joint launches. And so when there are two or more launching states involved... meaning when a launching state is either a state that launches or procures the launch or from whose territory or facility the object is launched. So when there are two or more launching states and then they don't register, the registration convention under Article 2, there is no real understanding of is there an order of priority then in this case? How exactly can we draw an inference based on this when there is no registration? And then in case of a disagreement between the two launching states later... In the absence of registration, how can we clarify that? Do we need to go back and tie this to de facto jurisdiction and control under Article 8 of the Outer Space Treaty? If this sounds like a lot of confusing concepts, then it's because it is, and it's because we need to find more practical solutions to these questions. Enhancing registration practices is definitely a priority in this sense, and we would urge states to focus on the registration convention and clarifying some of these issues. And even with the liability convention, there are questions regarding the interpretation of damages. Should damages be direct or indirect? Based on the Thaveau Préparatoire, I hope that pronunciation was acceptable, from the negotiating history of the treaty, we can see that indirect damages were intentionally left out. But did the drafters intend to... could the drafters have forcibly... predicted the range of space activities that have proliferated now. So these are all just a glimpse of the many questions that we have, but with existing obligations under binding treaties. And I hope that maybe we could start by clarifying some of these questions. Regarding the second question on using new technologies, specifically for rendezvous and proximity operations, I would absolutely agree. As long as, again, we're approaching this from the perspective that these are dual purpose technologies that can be used for benign purposes, as our panelists yesterday described. And so we would need to approach the use of these technologies with enhanced transparency. I would also add in this regard that the companies that have been engaged in developing this technology have been very committed to transparency. And this should also indicate how useful. the concept is for security in space.",2
S1M939,1,9,Martinez,"Thank you. Yes, just very briefly on the question of technologies, of course, one of the reasons why this OEWG is convened and why there are concerns around space security is because of the... the new capabilities brought about by these various emerging technologies underpinning things like On orbits a run of sorry close proximity operations and so on so there are these dual use concerns, but these technologies also are enabling for space sustainability And I think it's very important to recognize that a number of the space sustainability challenges we face will not be solved only by policy and regulatory measures. They will need technical solutions of the kinds that have these, raise these dual use concerns. So these are technologies, for example, that pertain to life extension, on orbit servicing, active debris removal and so on. It's very important that these be developed in a very transparent manner, and the application of these technologies in turn. can help to promote increased transparency, information sharing, and support verification. So I think the technologies certainly potentially have a lot to offer in terms of benefits for addressing some of the questions we're dealing with, both here and in Corpus. Thank you.",0
S1M941,1,9,France,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I would like to first express our thanks to today's panelists, Mrs. Raju and Mr. Martinez. In particular, you have mentioned the role of measures of transparency and confidence, and we share the role as you presented it, and the added value that it presents as a necessary step to build solid foundations. to strengthen space security. It seems important to us not to oppose voluntary standards to legally binding standards, as being two irreconcilable approaches. Regarding the list you have proposed, Mr. Martinez, of low-hanging foot measurements, and I can't find the appropriate translation in French. I would like to offer you some comments on the positions of France, without claiming the exhaustiveness of the list you have proposed. As for the measures of transparency, I would like to remind you that we presented the Space Defense Strategy of July 2019 in the context of the disarmament conference in August last year. In accordance with the recommendation that was included in this sense in resolution 7536, we did it, as well as other States afterwards, and it is a measure that seems important to us to strengthen transparency and confidence, and we really encourage the implementation of a trade on space doctrine. One of the elements of our space defense strategy, is the importance of a prohibiting norm the actions of the creation of waste of long life. And so we join here also one of the elements that has been listed. It is measures of reinforcement of notifications. There is an existing instrument as it was recalled by Japan which is the H-cock and which is an extremely useful instrument in this regard. Let's go back to the announcement that was made a few weeks ago by the United States. I would like to remind you that France has saluted this announcement and called for a universal and legally restrictive norm of prohibition of such actions. And finally, the fact that we are all gathered in this OEWG may already testify to the in itself, of our desire to move towards measures of transparency and confidence. This is what we are doing here, by debating in an inclusive and committed way. Thank you.",2
S1M944,1,9,Martinez,"I thank the French delegation for their comments. I think it was mostly in the nature of a comment rather than a question, but thank you for giving examples, concrete examples of how France is implementing some of these recommendations. And I think that's very valuable for the other delegations to receive these kinds of examples. So thank you for that. Just while I have the floor, I would like to take the opportunity to... acknowledge the tremendous role that France played in socializing the concept of space sustainability in Corpus. This was during the chairmanship of Gerard Brachet and in the years following his chairmanship of Corpus. So I think France played a tremendous role in raising awareness of the space sustainability as a topic. It wasn't an easy conversation in Corpus, but the French delegation, I think... put a lot of energy and time into this, and really created the conditions, the fertile ground, in which Korpus could take a decision to establish the LTS Working Group in 2010. And as we heard from our distinguished Iranian colleague, that it wasn't just an event, it's a process. And that process began with the efforts of France back in the early 2000s. So I just wanted to acknowledge that. Thank you.",2
S1M946,1,9,Korea,"Thank you, Chair, for giving me the floor. Due to the flight schedule, my delegation might not be present in this room in the afternoon, so I raised the flag to make a few comments on this topic. And I would like to convey my sincere gratitude to panelists, Ms. Radu and Mr. Martinez, for your insightful and very informative presentations today. and could be the strong foundation for the journey to the legally binding norms. And while considering its difficulty in achieving consensus in forming treaties and more difficulties in verification in space, we cannot leave space without a normative vacuum. So lack of trust, lack of confidence spurs miscalculation and further leads to elevated tension. That's why we should build trust each other first. So 2013 TCBMs GG report and 2018 Paris GG report could be a good start, which shows a list of transparency and confidence building measures, including information exchange and pre-notification. What we can do here in OEWG to add more value to them is to consider importance of TCBMs and discuss more specific ways to enhance implementation of those TCBMs. Or we can discuss ways to, if agreeable, develop a security version of LTS guidelines or ways to accumulate good practices in space. For my country, even if it's voluntary in nature, we see value of normative foundations such as LTS guidelines, and we are trying to implement those guidelines domestically. And forming a space version of a code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation, just mentioned before our Japanese and French colleagues, could be another good idea to think about. Thank you.",2
S1M948,1,9,Chile,"Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning. But it's not over until it's over, right? Practically all my questions have been answered. I was interested in knowing about the treaty, about the space and the need for flesh out, as Nividita explained a while ago. The dispositions in relation to those that have not been explained are sufficient. I also had a question about safety and security. And I'm speaking, talking in English, because in Spanish the term security involves safety. So we do have that problem. I think we've spoken a lot, Peter, about the overlaps and how to deal with Copuos and what we're doing. Nevertheless, there is still, there remains a gray area. And we spoke about this bilaterally before. You say that coordination is very important, and I do believe that it is, but how do you actually operationalize this coordination? And I do have, I also had a question that my Austrian colleague posed, but regarding TCBMs, TCBMs are looked upon with suspicion by countries who want to advance a legally binding instrument. They're seen in the view of a stalling mechanism, politically speaking. When do you think a TCBM might be ripe enough to be transformed into or to jump towards a legally binding instrument? I know it's a political decision, nevertheless, do we have objective parameters? So I'm trying to bridge here this situation between legally binding or voluntary norms and legally binding. Is there a mechanism? Do you have experience in other forums, in other instruments about these negotiations? I think that would be it. Thank you, Chair.",2
S1M950,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the excellent questions from the Chilean delegation. On the first point of terminology of safety and security, I think that this might maybe showcase – our limitations when we function in one language, because this has not been accurately captured. And perhaps this is a big billboard for what we need to address moving forward, because if we can't articulate the concept in different languages, then we won't share the same interpretation. And I believe this came up on our first day and even yesterday, that multilingualism will be key to this when we seek to interpret the provisions in the treaties. On the issue of operationalizing coordination, I think that maybe commitments to meetings in between sessions would be one practical step forward so that delegates on all sides and from all departments are fully informed of the developments. Perhaps this seems very simple, but at least we would ensure that there are regular exchanges of views and updates being shared from both forums and on all the sessions. On the issue of the question of suspicion from states that seek legally binding treaties, In this regard, I would say that, as I mentioned before, it's not, it isn't an either or, and TCBMs are complementary for both these outcomes, and one outcome very much feeds into the other. And certainly, we can learn from other domains. There are valuable lessons there, as we've learned from yesterday's panelists. But I would direct us back to the space law domain in this sense and look at how our negotiations developed for the treaties themselves. It was resolution 188418 and the declaration of legal principles in 1962. All of these have led to the formation and the official adoption of the outer space treaty. Again, a legally binding mechanism. And so TCBMs can bring us there. And I would say that we can proceed with caution picking out the measures that would most effectively assure this. My focusing on the clarification of existing legal principles. and the measures that I mentioned earlier, especially from a risk reduction and consultation perspective, I believe these would be key. And we will not be able to move further unless we engage in these mechanisms that can provide us with the environment that is necessary to arrive at that negotiating table for a legally binding treaty. And so that's my position. Thank you. Chairman: Thank you very much, Ms. Raju. Mr. Martinez. Thank you to the Chilean delegation for those excellent questions. So regarding terminology, yes, this is a challenge that we faced, that we encountered in Copos, and some of my colleagues in this room will remember we sometimes spent up to three or four hours negotiating the phrasing of just one sentence or a footnote. And for those of you who weren't familiar with the LTS process... If you read the guidelines, you may find awkward phrasing in some parts of the guidelines. That's not because the drafters were not able to produce more elegant English text. It's just that phrasing in English, as awkward as it may sound, is the phrasing that translated most accurately the intent into the other official languages of the UN, all of which are equally authentic. And so, again, the... the importance of respecting matters of language in multilateral diplomacy. On this point, I heard earlier in this week mention of a lexicon of terminology that may be something that could be useful to do. I believe there is some work being done in this regard. I think that might be helpful contribution to advancing the work and developing common understandings. As to how to operationalize the interaction of the first and fourth committee bodies dealing with outer space, there are some practical steps that can be taken that I think could be done within existing resources and budgets. The first could be to have briefings at the regularly scheduled sessions where representatives of one body are invited to give a briefing at the other body. When we were working on the GGE on TCBMs and the LTS guidelines in parallel, Victor Vasilyev came and briefed KOPUS. I briefed the GGE, and that was a very easy thing to do. There have also been occasional meetings of the First and Fourth Committee bodies dealing with space. We think that these are... useful opportunities to exchange views and updates on progress. And then as far as the multilateral institution itself, I think establishing and sustaining linkages between the relevant personnel in UNUSA and ODA would be another very practical way to support the operationalization of this interaction. As to the issue of TCBMs, transforming TCBMs into legally binding mechanisms, as I mentioned earlier, I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not going to speculate on that. But just to reinforce the remark that my co-panelists made, that these are both complementary. In my mind, it's not one or the other. And TCBMs can help to build common understanding. and thereby creating fertile ground for the eventual negotiation of legally binding instruments. Thank you. I thank both panelists for their very comprehensive answers to these questions. And now I offer the floor to the distinguished representative of Algeria. You have the floor, sir.",2
S1M951,1,9,Algeria,"Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to thank the panelists for the presentations that have allowed us to better appreciate the articulation between the legal rules and the non-constraining norms in the context of space security, as well as in the context of other relevant mechanisms. This articulation has also been at the center of the work of the subsidiary body. of the conference on disarmament in Paris in 2018, which also acknowledged that even if the proposed approaches differ, the feeling of urgency that is transparent indicates that progress on preventing a race for armaments in space is not only possible, but still necessary. Starting from different experiences in the framework of the forums you mentioned, and the work of the disarmament conference on Paros. And let's take into consideration the sense of urgency on the security angle, in view of preserving the peaceful character of space and preventing its militarization. I would like to know your opinion on the concrete way through which our working group will be able to contribute to bring the points of view on complementarity of the different approaches and possible progress tracks, especially in terms of combining between the adoption of legal rules and voluntary measures. In other words, what would be, in your opinion, the starting point and the final target, as well as the ten clicks for this in the context of this process? Another question that comes to mind is that of knowing If the problem of fragmentation of the legal rules between the specific regime and the general regime, mentioned during our deliberations in reference to the work of the commission of international law this week, this problem will not be reproduced between the legal rules governing the space security on the one hand and the voluntary measures. of safety and space safety, spread across unilateral, bilateral and multilateral frameworks of other parts. Finally, I would like to seize this opportunity to highlight the appreciation of my delegation for the quality of the constructive and stimulating exchanges that we have had throughout this week. Thank you.",1
S1M953,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the excellent questions from the delegation of Algeria. As a starting point through this group, in terms of the urgency, I believe that was emphasized, absolutely. I think that focusing on the legal concepts mentioned earlier in the treaties, clarifying that would be extremely useful, especially Article 9. And using the Millimons and Womera manuals will aid this process, of course. And then moving to the TCBMs that were previously proposed in the 2013 report from the risk reduction and consultation side, I think that these, again, we can seek to establish very concrete TCBMs out of these. on the point of fragmentation and how voluntary would feed into other processes and how unilateral, multilateral, bilateral and regional all fit together, absolutely. I think that this is why through this group we can focus on what it means to be a responsible actor in space. What do those best practices look like? What could a state be doing? What could commercial actors be doing? How do we understand how these technologies can be responsibly utilized? How can we make sure that we're notifying and communicating the intent behind these activities very, very clearly, both on a unilateral basis through our policies, as the French delegation mentioned earlier, through our policies and our strategies, and also in forums such as these. It is essential that we do the multilateral and unilateral and that these go hand in hand. Because if we do not have this unilateral sharing of information, then the data that reaches the multilateral forums may not be completely informed. And there may be more misperceptions based on the state's national position. And so I think that all of these go hand in hand together and that this group is a very useful forum to take that tangibly forward. Thank you very much. Peter? Thank you to the delegation of Algeria for that excellent question. So just to add on to what my fellow panelists have said here, the possibility of fragmented or divergent regulation is a concern not only for civil space activities but also for the security of space activities. Fragmentation or divergent regulation opens up the possibility of regulation shopping. It opens up... chain of custody issues because we are seeing more space activities being conducted in a multinational context where a national regulator may only have a limited view of a larger space activity. And that's why it's important, it will be important in future to enhance regu dialogue so that we have more transparency on what is happening in terms of space systems that are being implemented. actors. Also, another reason for enhancing coordination is that to try and avoid unilateral regulatory approaches, and hence again we come back to the importance of multilateralism, so that we can avoid unilateral regulatory approaches that that manifest a certain interpretation that may not be shared by all delegations or by all states. And so to give you one example. Unilateral approaches to regulation, for example, in defining keep out zones around activities on another celestial body or even in space, may not be shared by all other space actors. And so this is why it's so important to have these kinds of discussions in a multilateral format and also for regulators, national regulators, to improve their coordination with each other. Thank you.",2
S1M955,1,9,European Union,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. I will ask my question in French this time. I would like to thank the panelists today, Navedi Tarajou and Peter Martinez, for their presentations and their invitation to reflect on the theme 5 of voluntary mechanisms, and in particular measures of transparency and confidence I would rather say continuous processes of transparency and conf because it is a continuous process and not a punctual measure. Considering the importance of notifications in the context of these processes of transparency, I would like to... I would like to ask the panelists, and this has already been addressed by Peter Martinez, about the possible interaction between the two United Nations agencies, the UN and UNHCR. For the moment, UNHCR, the Office for the Pacific Use of Space, has a central role. as a holder of the space objects register, can we imagine to extend this central role of UNOSA also for other types of notifications, for example notifications for appointments and... Rendez-vous and proximity operations. It is on this subject, on the respective role of the two offices of the United Nations in the framework of the processes of transparency and trust generator that pose... That's my question. Thank you.",2
S1M957,1,9,Stockholm,"Thank you, Chair, and again, thank you for the amazing questions. These are very, very insightful. Indeed, the interaction between these two offices is something that we should devote greater attention to. Specifically on the subject of registration, as was raised by the representative, I think that there is still some understanding and maybe some consensus that we ought to achieve on when registration should occur. and when that notification about for registry particulars, when that's submitted, because as of now, there is a lot of flexibility and it's interpreted very differently. It's not going to be useful if we aren't, if we do not learn of schedule maneuvers, as our RPOs were also mentioned. It will not be helpful if we do not have this notification and ahead of time. So using registration would be, the registration mechanism is an excellent idea, but we would have to clarify that first and. make sure that states are committing to notify before the maneuver actually occurs. Regarding the question raised about verification, certainly in my view, I definitely agree it is possible to understand what is occurring in space using these technologies and we will reach a stage, I think, that when we're able to have a more fruitful discussion on this. However, it's important to draw the distinction and note that verification can only occur when there is... when there is a specific legal obligation under agreement and we're seeking to ensure compliance with that. So it's rather different from TCBMs in this stage and it's too early, quite different from TCBMs to kind of conflate the two. Maybe the activity itself would be the same, maybe whether it's a technical inspection. Of course, the activity may overlap between the two. But the purpose of verification is entirely different and I believe that it's far too early for us to be having that discussion yet the specific obligation and how states, and the means of doing so, how states are insuring compliance with that. Thank you. Thank you. I will try to be brief. Thank you for those excellent questions from the EU and the Argentinian delegation. So with regard to the registration question, we say indeed it maintains the International Register of Space Objects. But of course, the register, the information in the register is, of course, very valuable for ownership information. liability kind of information, but I think could be further developed, enhanced, to improve contact information for the operators of space objects. But certainly it's not an operational tool that somebody on the operations floor would use the register. There's other... information that's required to make operational decisions. And also with regard to that, I can foresee a challenge maintaining not only the international register but also national registries in light of the very rapid increase in the number of spacecraft being launched as we see these very large constellations being launched, how national regulators will be able to keep up. with the deluge of new registrations and indeed the Office for Outer Space Affairs. So I'd be interested to know how the Office will cope in future with this and whether they will need more resources. As to expanding the role of the Office to exchange information on space objects and events, well this is very much a decision in the hands of the Member States. as to whether they would wish to see the office's mandate expanded. Earlier on in this panel session, our distinguished Russian colleague reminded us of a proposal by the Russian Federation to establish a platform for the sharing of such information, and consensus could not be reached at that time on that proposal. And so whether such a role could be envisaged for USA in the future or... some other body is a discussion that needs to be had among the member states. As far as I think the second question had to do with can technologies be used to facilitate the observance of compliance? with some of these TCBMs, my answer would be yes, because much of what we are discussing here is around behaviors, not functions or capabilities. Functions and capabilities are very difficult to ascertain in a space object, but a behavior is something that can be seen, and we're starting to see a proliferation of SSA capabilities around the world, both government-owned and also in the private sector. So countries will have access to more sources of information through which they can independently verify what is happening and get a better understanding of contingency situations in space. So in brief, yes, I think technology will help with the verification of behavior-based TCBMs. Thank you.",2
S1M959,1,9,France,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yes, I will be back on Earth in a short time. Indeed. I will not be there for the next session of the working group, of our working group. I would like to tell you how much I have enjoyed working with you so far. It will be a... a partially new team that will represent France for the next work. Thank you very much for giving me the floor because this afternoon I will not be there personally, but I would like to, and my delegation would like to make a few remarks in general and deliver our first impressions on this week of substantial work. which for us have been extremely productive and constructive, and in an inclusive environment, what we are celebrating. This shows, I believe, the great interest of all for these subjects and to dramatically improve security and space safety. During this week's discussions, my delegation has in particular four points, which are the following. First, international law applies to its integrity in space. This point seems to me consensual and I think that this key element will therefore appear in the final report. This is a solid basis on which we can build. This must understand, in our opinion, the DIH, the Humanitarian Interest Law. The delegations have also recognized the relevance of the current framework applicable to space, which would gain to be reinforced, in particular to be in phase with the rapid evolution in space. My country reaffirms here its attachment to the relevant principles of this framework, including the peaceful use of space. Second point, many useful contributions and interesting proposals have been made this week to guide the work of our group, including, of course, the proposals that are related to particular categories of behavior. And we remember the idea of taking into account the effects of space activity to make definitions progress. Let's take into account of the duality of spatial objects. Indeed, space is a domain in which systems are mostly high. We really appreciated the distinction between dual usage and dual purpose. The difficulty of distinguishing between civil and military objects in space is a reinforcement of uncertainty, a reinforcement of instability. In the same way, the difficulty of detecting and assigning certain activities poses the risk of more serious misinterpretations and misunderstandings. It appears, for example, complicated to distinguish, a priori, a priori, a maneuver. anodine of a satellite that would lead to a collision or an accidental clouding of a maneuver intended to damage. Third point, there is a strong consensus, it seems to us, on the desire to approach security in space in a global manner, taking into account all existing threats. Fourth point, we think that this session has allowed us to strengthen our common understanding of the added value of voluntary norms. We have heard some delegations that have indicated the subjective nature of the notion of responsible behavior. And precisely, the purpose of this working group is to define this notion together, collectively. We must... by agreeing with what is a responsible behaviour, objective this notion. For France, the implementation of necessary behaviour standards It appears urgent. An approach by behaviors appears today as the most suitable. By framing the behavior of certain activities in order to prevent it from being perceived as aggressive. This approach aims to reduce their destabilizing potential and to reduce the risks of conflict and climbing in space. Moreover, the approach based on behaviors, which focuses on the effects of these, on the spatial systems, on the environment, on the populations, appears more perennial to us, because it cannot be surpassed by future technological developments. Mr President, dear colleagues, space threats are a reality that we observe every day. It is therefore urgent to collectively grasp this question if we want to maintain the peaceful character of space. By implementing rules, principles and responsible behaviour, we will be able to respond to the threats we face today. These rules could then serve as a basis for discussions for the establishment of a legally restrictive treaty. If there is a consensus and if verification mechanisms, I insist, can be implemented. Mr President, I just wanted to make a small technical point important for my delegation. We noted this week, regarding the interpretation of our proposals in the five other languages of the United Nations, some discordance, some misunderstandings. So I encourage delegations to read our statements on the website to avoid any misunderstandings on our positions. Thank you Mr. President and all my wishes and again thank you for the way you have led remarkably our work.",1
S1M961,1,9,Pakistan,"Thank you very much Mr. Chairperson for giving my delegation an opportunity to speak on item five. Although my remarks are broader, I do wish to thank the two panelists for their contribution to our discussion today. Mr. Chairman, in the past six decades, the outer space has witnessed transformational developments in several aspects, ranging from peaceful exploration to growing development of assets. and increasing reliance on these objects for a variety of uses. Concurrently, the international community has developed universal principles and norms to control, regulate, and in some cases, prohibit activities incompatible with the peaceful uses of this distant space. Once the exclusive preserve of a few states, there are now increasing number of states, other actors, and objects in outer space, along with ever greater integration with reliance on and diverse uses at planet earth. Fortunately, there are several multilateral institutions with distinct mandates to deliberate and develop a set of measures to ensure that outer space remains a global common for all people and states. Yet, as the convening of this OEWG illustrates, the spectrum of threats to outer space has widened and become even more complex. any objective matrix, there is a heightened arms race in and weaponization of outer space than ever before, with attendant risks to peaceful uses. The nature and extent of security threats in and from outer space to outer space as well as Earth has grown many-fold. The most visible manifestation of these threats is the unstoppable arms race and placement of weapons in outer space. Even more worryingly, such threats are magnified by the growing integration of weapons technologies platforms and dedicated force structures in the nuclear, cyber, conventional and outer space domains. The mutually reinforcing nature of defensive and offensive capabilities such as the deployment of missile defense systems and their amalgamation with outer space systems represents yet another layer of threats to strategic stability at the global and regional levels. In the absence of legal constraints, these systems allow pre-emptive and disarming strikes against terrestrial systems, entailing dangerous consequences for safety, security and sustainability at Earth and in outer space. The line between peaceful and military uses of outer space as being blurred as non-governmental actors themselves are no longer singularly confined to the space. to its peaceful exploitation. The growing fusion between civilian intelligence and military institutions and endeavors is no longer a well-kept secret. Some states openly speak about extending deterrence to outer space. Destabilizing capabilities such as anti-satellite weapons and directed energy weapons are being complemented by placement of weapons in outer space with potential implications for outer space as well as on Earth. These developments undermine the spirit and principles of existing international law governing outer space. Left unaddressed, these growing risks pose serious threats to global as well as regional peace, security and stability. Mr. Chair, this state of affairs underscores into alia that the existing normative and legal architecture governing the security dimensions of outer space has not kept pace with growing risks. It also illustrates that the existing international legal regime has seemingly been unable to infuse responsible behaviour in reducing space threats or preventing an arms race in outer space and weaponisation of outer space. Forseeing the dangers of militarisation of this space and recognising the lack of legal rules to offset them effectively, the international community has for decades called for further measures and appropriate international negotiations. to prevent an arms race in outer space. The 10th session of the UN General Assembly devoted to disarmament and numerous subsequent consensus resolutions of this universal body reaffirm realization of this longstanding imperative. As the UNIDIRS compilation noted, the CD worked on developing a legal framework to prevent an arms race in outer space with a focus on three dimensions. These included one. effective and verifiable agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space, number two, agreement to prohibit anti-satellite systems, and number three, a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space. Unfortunately, the CD has long been prevented by some to start negotiations on Paros. Sadly, despite increasing evidence of weaponization and growing arms race, states continue to obstruct commencement of Paros negotiations to this day. citing concerns which can be addressed during the course of the CD's work. Mr Chairman, with this overview of the threats and risks, let me now turn to how this OEWG can and should advance our discussions in ways that help reduce security threats to and from outer space credibly and effectively. In our view, the primary litmus test for the relevance and value addition of this OEWG's work is whether and to what extent It maintains international consensus on preventing an arms race in outer space and tackles the threats from placement of weapons in outer space. Whether the OEWG will only consider the range of threats alone without reaffirming the applicability of existing principles and rules and proposing new rules to plug the existing gaps in the international regime governing outer space and moving us towards the start of power of negotiations? In our view, at the least, the OEWG should endeavor to answer the fundamental question of how to start Paros negotiations. After all, norms, rules, and principles, even on behaviors, can always be examined during the long overdue treaty negotiations on Paros. During its two-year course, the OEWG would have to comprehensively examine the full array and nature of threats, that is, kinetic as well as non-kinetic. from capabilities in various orbital situations, direct ascent capabilities, as well as from those other terrestrial systems or from enablers of yet another set of terrestrial systems. We stress, therefore, the centrality of three core principles and their reaffirmation by the OEWG. First, the principle enshrined in the Outer Space Treaty, that is, use of outer space for the benefit and in the interests of all countries. Number two, the cardinal principle of ensuring equal security for all states. And number three, the primary responsibility of states with significant military capability vis-a-vis prevention of an arms race in outer space. Mr. Chairman, finally, we have yet to see the viability of evolving new norms of responsible when the international environment on planet Earth is marked by acute trust and confidence deficits. Our conversations so far also point to the necessity of avoiding the pitfall of focusing on peripheral issues alone at the cost of core questions surrounding security in outer space. In our view, the OEWG would do well to guard against exerting too much effort in duplicating conversations. suited for other UN platforms looking at safety-oriented aspects of outer space. While we do recognize the complexities related to verification in certain scenarios or of definitional issues from certain aspects, these are not insurmountable challenges, especially if the outcomes of this group are envisioned to be of a generic nature. In any case, this dimension would remain part and parcel of this unique domain even if we apply a behavior-based lens alone. The notion of promoting responsible and irresponsible behaviors, therefore, remains tenuous at best. We also continue to share concerns expressed by many over the past two years regarding the negative implications arising from such an approach on the peaceful uses of outer space. Having said that, we look forward to the OEWG developing agreement as a first step that its conceptualization of behaviors vis-a-vis out- Vis-a-vis space security is directly linked to the notion of capabilities and is intertwined with which capabilities are developed, deployed and potentially used, especially in light of the cardinal principles of outer space treaty of 1967. Therefore, in our view, one of the norms that this OEWG should look at developing is the prohibition of placement of weapons other than WMDs in outer space. that is weapons that could be used to engage targets on Earth, in air or in outer space, as well as those against outer space from Earth. We also propose that the second and third week of the OEWG should also include dedicated sessions to examine three aspects. First, the nature of the arms race in outer space and its impacts on international and regional security. Number two, elaborate measures that can help reduce space threats, including those arising from the militarization and weaponization of outer space. And number three, explore recommendations on elements of an international legally binding instrument on Paros. Mr. Shehman, while by no means an easy task, we do hope for consensual outcomes from this group. It goes without saying that space security as an end can hardly be ensured without credible and legal binding tools to guard outer space from increasing threats. Neither does it appear viable to solve outer space security in a piecemeal, selective or partial manner. A holistic approach to security in outer space, including an examination of the various dimensions I have touched on, remains the most practical option for this group. It may also have the added advantage of being to the benefit of all states. If history is any guide, technological or military monopolies of the few do not last for too long. It is therefore both urgent and prudent to prevent weaponizing outer space and the ensuing devastating peace, security and socio-economic consequences for states and societies. Let us avoid the mistakes of the past, dismissing the imperative and urgency of legal instruments to prevent further weaponization in outer space should not obscure the past realities of nuclear arms race and growth in these arsenals. We look forward to engaging other delegations on the full spectrum of space threats and the development of effective measures to mitigate the risks for everyone emanating from a militarized, contested and congested outer space. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.",4
S1M963,1,9,United States,"Thank you Mr. Chair. Querido amigo, ante todo permítame felicitarle por su elección. Como usted bien lo sabe, usted tiene todo el apoyo de nuestra delegación. Mr. Chair, the delegation of the Holy See has been in a listening mode during this first session. As a matter of fact, we did not intend to take the floor, but we have been encouraged to share some general remarks by the richness of the discussion. In particular, we find it useful for the OEWG to address the already existing international treaties as this provides an indication of what is still lacking at the level of governance to reduce threats. Mr. Chair, the first astronauts who looked out of the porthole at the blue dot that is our beautiful planet, our common home, must have felt an overwhelming emotion of unity and a sense of belonging to the one human family. Indeed, all of humanity shares a common living space, along with the wonders and vulnerabilities that go along with this inescapable fact. The harmony of celestial bodies and their relationship with the Earth condition several of our daily activities and hence the importance of cooperation and fair regulation of outer space activities. Indeed, it is not by chance that this is the objective of the lofty ambition enshrined in Article I of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. which affirms that the exploration and use of outer space shall be the province of all mankind. It is interesting that during the discussion this week, we've heard some delegation and panelists drawing a parallel between the outer space and the digital realm. Our delegation wishes to reaffirm that a global commons approach to the digital realm makes eminent sense in order to prevent lawlessness and promote the common good. just as it does in outer space. In the outer space, just in the cyberspace, we also have common responsibilities. There are fundamental limits that must be observed in the interest of all members of the human family. Mr. Chair, our interaction will prove to be beneficial in the measure that we can agree on shared norms to guide us. In this regard, the Holy See intends to present a position paper during the next sessions of this OEWG. For now, it would be useful to propose some general ethical guidelines that we consider important. First, the outer space is a common good, in Latin, a res nullius. It would be in the interest of all not to reproduce in the outer space the mistakes that were committed on Earth, such as pollution and reckless exploitation of resources. The most advanced states or private actors, have no right to impose their supremacy in the outer space or to appropriate resources for individual economic or military interests. Once again, the outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, are the common heritage of all states. Second, the outer space has to be preserved as a domain where peace has to be maintained and where relations among states should be guided by cooperation for scientific purposes and not for confrontation. In this regard, the promotion of joint scientific projects would be a good way to turn threats into opportunities guided by the principle of human fraternity. Third and last, in this regard, one of the threats is that the outer space is becoming increasingly polluted by debris coming from the destruction of satellites. It is important to note here that the astronomical research, the science, can be severely hampered by the presence of all this debris. which unfortunately is already the case, as well as by the consequences of the militarization of the outer space, as well as the activities from Herve. Mr. Chair, these are just a few points on which we intend to elaborate during the next sessions. At a time of heightened international tensions, building trust becomes increasingly important. We have the opportunity and wisdom to preserve a place where arms race is prevented. Let us be guided by the interest of the common good and by the principle of human fraternity in the conduct of all our activity in outer space and on earth, with due regard for the corresponding interests of all states. Finally, let me take this opportunity to thank the Ambassador of France for all his work and his contribution to multilateralism during the course of this year. Thank you very much.",4
S1M965,1,9,Israel,"Thank you, Chair. We would like to thank you for the effective way you have led this OEWG for the past week. In addition, I would like to convey through you our gratitude to all the panelists who participated in our discussions this week as well. Going back to the past week's fruitful discussions, Israel considers that the law of armed conflict generally applies to outer space operations conducted in the context of an armed conflict. The question of how different rules under the law of armed conflict apply in this domain, particularly given its distinct features, may present challenging and complicated questions, especially given the fact that there is very limited state practice and opinion juris on the matter. In contending with these questions, It is important to follow accepted lethal methodologies for identifying customary international law and for interpreting international treaties. In this regard, special attention should be given to the fact that some LOAC rules have been crystallized in a domain-specific context, whether in relation to land, air, or sea. It is also important not to conflate existing law. with suggestions for how the law should be. Moreover, it is important for the sake of terminological clarity and legal accuracy to clearly distinguish in our discussions between the different branches of international law – Jus ad bellum, jus in bello, peacetime law, and so on. Finally, we believe that this week's discussion discourse reflected the complexity of the issue, and our discussion should therefore continue with this in mind. Thank you. Muchas gracias, señor Presidente.",2
S1M967,1,9,India,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be very brief. I take the floor to thank you for your and to express the appreciation of my delegation for the skillful and tactful manner in which you have guided the proceedings of this open-ended working group thus far. It has been a very productive session. The panels and the discussions have been excellent. India's position on the concept of responsible behavior in space has been articulated in its EOV in the First Committee. That being said, we will continue to engage in this process in the intersessional period and in the forthcoming sessions in a constructive manner. We fully comprehend the importance of this subject and its increasing salience in relations between nations and that it will be more so in the years to come. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",1
S1M969,1,9,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wasn't going to speak. I just wanted to make a request to give the delegation the opportunity to speak with the general statements of the common character at the end of the day. But you have already ahead of me. I thank you for that. Your actions can be seen as preventive, preemptive and anticipated.",2
S1M102,1,10,China,"Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to take the floor on this agenda item. the voluntary mechanisms and regimes. especially their contributions to the maintenance of space security. as well as. the relationship between these mechanisms and the regimes, their relationship with the efforts made by the international community in achieving Paris. During this morning's discussion, the two panelists. their presentations and their interaction with the delegations. I'm sure all the colleagues present in this morning's discussion have greatly been inspired by them. Before the end of this morning's discussion, some colleagues referred to these topics as well as some other wider topics that our working group has been discussing. My statement now is related to this morning's discussion as well as the topic of this afternoon, as well as to wrap up our discussion now. Mr. Chairman, under your leadership, the Working Group has carried out smooth and pragmatic discussion. and it's helpful for us to have an in-depth discussion on the relevant topics. The Chinese delegation would like to congratulate you and all the colleagues on this. This discussion of the discussion of this week make us realize further that responsible behavior in the outer space is a concept that cover a wide range of issues. its content and the effective way to achieve this, there are different views among delegations on all this. How do we carry out a far-reaching and fruitful work in this respect and on the basis of consensus reach or conduct a fruitful discussion in this regard? especially this morning's discussions, particularly inspiring. We would like to provide the following points in this regard. First, with a view to enabling the parties to further in-depth and fruitful work in future meetings, and finally to exploring useful results based on the consensus, we would like to share these views and general suggestions. First, we believe the work of the working group must uphold an open, transparent, equal, and mutual respect principle. The work of the working group is to balance the views of all parties on the basis of collective wisdom and brainstorming. This requires all parties to fully respect the different views of others. and listen carefully to each other's views and propositions. At the same time, The work of the working group should continue to strive towards an open and transparent direction. All delegations expect that the Chairman will have an interaction with the delegations ahead of time, and to solicitate the views of all delegations. I noticed that this morning, the representative of Pakistan has already put forward some concrete suggestions in this regard. rather on the topics of the next meeting. We would like to express our support in this regard, and we hope that, Chairman, we will take into full consideration of these suggestions. Second, the Working Group should bear in mind clearly the overall objective of Paris and to uphold the general direction of Paris. During this week's discussion, Many delegations repeatedly stressed the urgency and the necessity of preventing an arms race in outer space. Of course, there are some other voids which suggest that in accordance with the suggest that to set out a rules of engagement in light of the history of mankind on the area of sea and space. rather on the area of land, sea and space. Some colleagues pessimistically believe that the history of mankind over the sea and the sky will repeat in outer space. China cannot agree with such a view. We need to reflect profoundly what kind of signal this working group is going to send to the international community. China believes that formulating norms of behavior in outer space must be carried out within the general framework of preventing weaponization and arms race in outer space. Only by setting out a basic principle of overall peace and security in the outer space, our discussion of safety in outer space has its meaning. To this end, it is not only necessary for us in the work of the working group to avoid diverting from the general goal of perils. It is all the more necessary for us to reflect a series of important principles that are important to safeguarding the overall security of outer space in the outcome of our work. As for how the working group can safeguard the peace and security in outer space, many delegations have made – have put forward important ideas. China has also expressed its views, including No country should seek dominance in outer space or to compete for dominance. Outer space must not become the new battleground of mankind. and weapons must not be placed in outer space. use or threat of use of weapons should not be allowed in outer space. These important principles and views themselves should become an important part of the norms of responsible behaviour in outer space. On the basis of this, effective measures should be taken and to conclude legally binding arms control instruments. This should be the long-term goal of the international community as well as the important premise of the work of this working group. Thirdly, many developing countries have stressed the importance of maintaining peaceful use of outer space as the legitimate rights of these countries as well as the importance of international cooperation. especially Effective measures must be taken to avoid discriminatory practice and norms, which may affect or prevent the developing countries from peaceful use of outer space. As a matter of fact, the fundamental goal of safeguarding security in the outer space is for the peaceful use of outer space. All developing countries are important. stakeholders in this process. China encourages all developing countries. to bear in mind the importance and the interest of maintaining and strengthening cooperation and their rights in the peaceful use of outer space, and put forward more specific proposals and recommendations. The voice and propositions of the developing countries should have the attention of the working group and deserve full consideration in the working group. and should also be fully reflected in the outcome of the working group. So much for the time being. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S1M104,1,10,Russia,"Thank you, Chair. I would like to discuss the topic of the topic the topic five which was submitted for discussion for the OEWG. Distinguished colleagues. The Russian Federation views TCBMs in space as one of the most important components in efforts to prevent an arms race in outer space. We view these as interim measures. as we develop a legally binding instrument. which would be capable. capable of maintaining outer space free of weapons and preventing it from becoming an arena for armed confrontation. TCBMs in space activities, however... cannot and should not. replace such legally binding instruments as... rather should not replace these instruments and should be only temporary and subsidiary in nature. In particular, they could be applicable as elements of a verification mechanism of legally binding agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space. In our view, TCBMs in outer space should be used to prevent weapons fully in outer space, including use or threat of force against space objects or using them. This role of TCBMs is laid down in the report of the GGE on this issue and in the document of the UN Commission on Disarmament, which is called Guiding Principles. regarding TCBMs and implementation of these measures at the global and regional levels. This document was drawn up and adopted by the GA in 1984. in the report of the GGE on TCBMs, and especially in paragraph 20, it states that in general, TCBMs... are an instrument with which governments can have an exchange of information to create mutual trust, to avoid miscalculations, and in so doing prevent a military confrontation and strengthen regional and global stability. In other words... confidence building measures relate directly both to military and any other kind of operational activity in space. However, many TCBMs in space activities... are related to the revealing of confidential information relating to state's security. In this regard, in spite of the fact that recommendations from the group provide for TCBMs as voluntary and not legally binding, We believe. that implementation of such measures can be planned into alia in a prior format, that is to say as part of specific legally binding instruments. On a bilateral or multilateral basis, An example of their use in this manner could be... bilateral agreements on the prevention of dangerous space activities within the OSCE, namely the Code of Conduct for Security and also the Vienna Document of 2011. At present, a successful example of voluntary mechanisms to increase the security of space operations, safety of space operations, is the guiding principles of COPWAS, preventing the emission of debris in space, and also principles using two nuclear sources of energy in outer space. States and international organizations and other participants in space activities are recommended to adopt voluntary national mechanisms. including measures to ensure the highest possible level of implementation of the provisions of these documents. This only underscores the voluntary nature. of these two documents. This principle is not legally binding. However, in spite of the optional and subsidiary nature, it's already shown itself to be successful and a productive mechanism to enhance safety in the space environment. the most effective and useful TCBM at present to maintain international peace and ensure equal and indivisible security for all and to enhance predictability and sustainability of states' activities in monitoring the use of space for peaceful purposes remains an inclusive... political obligation for non-first placement of weapons in outer space. This is an unprecedented initiative in its significance. And it becoming global is a big step towards developing an internationally legally binding document to prevent an arms race in outer space. This initiative should not be viewed in isolation from efforts undertaken by the international community to prevent an arms race in outer space. in keeping with the relevant GA resolution. four leaflet participants. in NFP already include 30 states. To support this initiative, there is annual adoption of a relevant resolution in the GA. The document traditionally garners support from about two-thirds of UN member states. The relevance and need for the NFP initiative is reflected in OSCE documents, CIS documents, CSTO documents, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and many other bilateral and multilateral documents. it is important that the NFP Non-First Placement Initiative should take into account the need for developing countries to have access to space. This should not require financial or other resources for the decision to be adopted. There only needs to be political will. in general. if the obligation for NFP is adopted by all states. especially spacefaring states, then the situation regarding non-deployment of weapons in outer space will become more predictable. and there will be a justified certainty that for the foreseeable future space will remain free of strike systems, offensive weapons systems and thereby a favorable situation will be created for substantive negotiations to be held. towards concluding a relevant treaty or treaties containing safeguards. against the weaponization of outer space. The Russian Federation calls on all states to consider adopting political commitments for non-first placement of weapons in outer space. Furthermore, we believe that at this stage an important TCBM would be UN member states affirming their commitment to the existing international norms and principles which govern space activities. I am referring to the UN. to the provisions of the UN Charter, the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, the Treaty Preventing Nuclear Weapons in Outer Space and Underwater of 1963, the Declaration of Legal Principles on State Activities of 1963, and the Convention on International Responsibility for Damage to Space Objects, the Convention on Registration of 1974, the Convention Preventing Military or Hostile Weapons in Outer Space of 1977, and also the decision of the first special session of the GA on Disarmament of 1968. which stated that space should be used for only peaceful purposes. stepping up efforts to prevent an arms race in outer space, and launching negotiations in the spirit of the Treaty of 1967. In conclusion, I wish to note that during the discussions, there was repeated mention of the Hague Code of Conduct regarding ballistic missiles. the mention of this mechanism as a voluntary confidence building measure, a voluntary TCBM. is not something we can object to. However, what we need to take into account is the situation concerning this mechanism. And within it, in recent years, we have seen it deteriorate. It has become less effective. And there has been less attention and interest from states towards the mechanism. which leads to a condition whereby states. give notifications less and less often through this mechanism regarding their ballistic missiles and the states that do give such notifications often give incomplete information. And therefore, when we speak of effective applicable mechanisms and ones that we can use as TCBMs, then initially we need to consider how effective they truly are, how viable they are. and what real prospects they have, because at present the prospects of the Hague Code of Conduct... for behave, these are not very encouraging in our view. That was everything I wanted to say on this issue that we are discussing today. and I wish to reserve the right. to make a general statement later on at the end of this session. I thank you.",4
S1M106,1,10,United States,"Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to provide remarks on the implementation of transparency and confidence building measures. President Biden's interim national security strategic guidance clearly states that the United States will explore and use outer space for the benefit of humanity and ensure the safety, stability and security of outer space activities. As part of these efforts to strengthen the stability in outer space, The United States will continue to pursue measures to encourage responsible actions in and the peaceful use of outer space. The United States believes that advancing a shared understanding of transparency and confidence building measures and norms of behaviors in outer space can enable risk reduction measures, increase transparency, and therefore enhance stability. Implementing multilateral measures that are voluntary, pragmatic, and transparent. can build confidence, which is an important step in addressing misunderstandings or misinterpretations. To that end, the United States was pleased to join consensus last year on UN General Assembly Resolution 7655, which encouraged member states to hold regular discussions on the practical implementation of outer space transparency and confidence building measures. The United States was pleased. to see the resumption of discussions on TCBMs in this year's UN Disarmament Commission. Moreover the United States supports the ongoing and complementary implementation of the UN debris mitigation guidelines and the UN copious long-term sustainability guidelines. We recall that the 2013 TCBMs GGE report notes that some of the LTS guidelines could be considered as potential transparency and confidence building measures, or serve as a technical basis for the implementation of TCBMs. As noted by many panelists, some overlap between the 2013 GGE and the UN COPUS long-term sustainability guidelines is inevitable, even with respect for each respective mandate. As we heard this morning from Ms. Raju, TCBMs are not simply an addition to the process, but should, quote, be brought to the center of the discussion in order to make progress. The United States believes that a more pragmatic and comprehensive approach is needed. A comprehensive approach includes reviewing existing international agreements, principles and other measures, analyzing existing and future counter space threats, and then developing further specific. tailored and practical voluntary measures to address these threats. The 2013 consensus report of the group of governmental experts was an important step in developing ideas around TCBMs. The GGE report made clear that transparency and confidence building measures are a means by which governments can share information with the aim of creating mutual understanding and trust, reducing misperceptions. and miscalculation and thereby helping both to prevent military confrontation and to foster regional and global stability. That sentence in paragraph 20 describes two goals for our efforts here at the OEWG. One, preventing military conflict and two, fostering regional and global stability. That paragraph goes on to state that these measures can build confidence in the peaceful increase understanding, enhance clarity of intentions, and create conditions for establishing a predictable strategic situation in both the economic and security areas. That is why the United States has supported the process of identifying responsible behaviors to manage perceived threats and risks to space systems. It is through that process, and especially here in this open-ended working group, that we will begin building the shared understanding between states, developing common standards of behavior necessary for a foundation of trust and cooperation between operators in the space environment, and reduce the risk of operating in space and the risk of conflict extending into outer space. We should recognize that military satellites will interact more with other military, civilian, and private sector space systems. Some interactions will be beneficial, while other interactions could be viewed as potentially threatening or dangerous. The international community must work together to address these issues rather than ignoring them because they don't fit some states' definitions of preventing an arms race in outer space. We encourage all states to continue to review and implement, to the greatest extent practicable, the recommendations contained in the 2013 consensus report of the Group of Governmental Experts. In this regard, the United States recalls the discussion of criteria contained in the 2013 GGE report. These criteria highlight the importance of TCBMs, which are clear, practical, and confirmable. They also underscore the importance of measures which specifically relate to observable behaviors and the reduction or elimination of the causes of mistrust, misunderstanding, and miscalculation. The 2013 GGE report provides a number of TCBMs that could be considered as part of the work of this crew. I'd like to make comments on four of these. First, the United States strongly supports the information exchange provisions contained in section 4A of the 2013 report. The United States implements this provision to the publication of numerous documents on our space policies and also through bilateral and multilateral information exchanges. regarding our space policies. Our 2020 national space policy is available online for all to read. On December 1st, 2021, the United States released the space priorities framework, which builds on the national space policy and will guide the work of the Biden-Harris administration's outer space activities. In addition, the United States makes available its military policies, doctrines, and strategies. For example, in 2020, The United States published a defense space strategy and a space cap zone publication, which lays out the doctrine which guides the U.S. Space Force. Again, all of these documents are available online. The United States welcomes conversations on any of these documents. We believe that the publication of such documents will help enhance international stability. Rather than keeping those documents hidden from public review, as some member states, that also have independent military organizations dedicated to outer space do. As Ms. Raju indicated this morning, such open publication should be a widespread practice. Second, related to publishing military expenditures, the United States publishes its government expenditures for all space activities, not only military and national security. The annual aeronautics and space report of the President which dates back to 1958, includes a comprehensive description of the programmed activities and the accomplishments of all agencies of the United States government in the field of outer space activities. Moreover, the budget for our military space activities is also publicly available. For example, the U.S. Space Force recently published its budget request for the fiscal year 2023. In that detailed request, You can see what areas the Space Force will be spending money on, with this year including a specific focus on developing resilient satellite architectures to respond to the growing development of anti-satellite threats. Third, with respect to exchanges of information on the basic orbital parameters of outer space objects, the United States believes that such behavior can provide transparency regarding specific space activities. The future space operating environment will be shaped by a significant increase in the volume and diversity of activity by the private sector and space. To implement this TCBM, the United States government publicly shares its space catalog for free on space track.org. And conducts review of the trajectories of all active space objects for potential on orbit collisions. In cases where potential collision hazard is calculated, the United States Space Command through the United States Space Forces 18th Space Defense Squadron provides relevant analysis to all affected spacecraft operators. to support their decisions regarding collision avoidance maneuvers. At the same time, we are looking to enhance our cooperation in this area. Those basic space flight safety services currently provided by the U.S. Space Command will be transferred to the U.S. Department of Commerce, where the Department of Commerce will expand the U.S. approach to space traffic coordination. Working with industry and international partners, this new approach will leverage data, and services provided from a variety of government, commercial, academic, and international sources to both enhance space flight safety and to begin developing open, transparent, and credible international space traffic coordination standards, policies, and practices. Finally, paragraph 45 of the GGE report encourages countries to avoid the intentional destruction of any on-orbit spacecraft. and launch vehicle orbital stages. Such destructive anti-satellite tests are always conducted by choice. The United States has determined that conducting destructive direct-descent anti-satellite missile tests cannot be justified as responsible. As such, we have made a choice to refrain from such tests. As Dr. Martinez noted this morning, the declaratory value of such a commitment is not dependent upon whether a country has developed such a capability. But by making such a commitment, the member state contributes its voice in order to identify this in the international community as an emerging norm. As such, we urge other countries to make the same assessments. If other member states reach the same understanding, we urge them to make similar commitments to refrain from conducting these dangerous and irresponsible destructive direct-descent anti-satellite missile tests in order to preserve the benefits of space. for all nations. Thank you Mr. Chair for your leadership this week and I would like to thank colleagues in the room for the very constructive cooperation and exceptional discussions this week.",4
S1M108,1,10,Sweden,"for giving me the floor. First, just let me start by saying that we align ourselves fully with the EU statement made in the beginning of this week. And now I just want to make a few comments on topic five of our fifth topic today on voluntary mechanisms and regimes applicable to outer space. in the context of threats arising from state behaviors with respect to outer space. Sweden regards outer space as a global common to be used for the benefit of all. We also underline the applicability of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, to activities in outer space, as reflected in Article 3 of the Outer Space Treaty. When developing, planning and executing space activities, states must do so in accordance with their obligations under international law. Sweden is strongly committed to strengthening international security and stability and to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, which is essential for safeguarding the long-term use of the space environment for peaceful purposes. This is also why we have supported the UNGA resolution establishing this open-ended working group. We're very encouraged by this week's deliberations, which we believe further importance and the importance and the usefulness of this multilateral process, with the purpose of agreeing on norms, rules, and principles for responsible state behavior in outer space. doing just that, agreeing on voluntary norms for responsible behavior, constitute a pragmatic way forward without excluding the possibility of future legally binding measures. A common understanding against which to measure state activities will contribute to building transparency, confidence and security by reducing threats and risks of misperception, miscalculation and unintended escalation of conflict. This open-ended working group could thereby also help to create the momentum to further future steps. Examples of voluntary norms that have contributed to increased transparency and confidence building are the Hague Code of Conduct, the COPUS Debris Mitigation Guidelines, and the Long-Term Sustainability Guidelines. In this context, we also wish to reiterate our welcoming of the recent commitment by the United States, as well as that of Canada announced earlier this week, not to conduct destructive, direct anti-satellite missile testing as a norm for responsible behavior in outer space, contributing to safety, security and long-term sustainability of outer space. This is a positive step for others to follow. And before I conclude, just me once again thank you for this week to you Chairman and to your team. and to all the excellent panelists and of course to the interpreters. And we look forward to the next session in September. Thank you.",4
S1M1010,1,10,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I wish to thank the panelists that lent their expertise this morning. My delegation, most of the members of whom are following our discussions from Manila, where it is now 10 in the evening, benefited from their expertise. In the spirit of interactive dialogue, my delegation wishes to speak on agenda item six to offer some thoughts related to the ongoing discussions. First, the Philippines affirms that space must be exclusively for peaceful purposes. And we also think that in addition to being part of the Global Commons, outer space is part of the common heritage of mankind. We reaffirmed this when we ratified the Moon Treaty. We agree with other delegations that spoke before me on the need to affirm the exigencies of preventing an arms race in outer space and therefore to intensify our work on Paris. We agree on the need to prevent weaponization of outer space and we affirm that we need a legally binding instrument in this regard. The working paper that has been submitted by ASEAN today affirms this as well. We agree that our work must not be taken in isolation from the exigencies of achieving a legally binding instrument. And the resolution that created this OEWG acknowledges this. We agree also that TCBMs must not replace our work for a legally binding instrument. However, we see TCBMs as an important component of this work. Having said these. We would like to offer a few thoughts on TCBMs based on the discussions that we had this morning. First, we agree with our panelists that TCBMs could be pursued across multiple dimensions, multilateral, bilateral, regional, but also unilateral. It is important for states, especially spacefaring ones, to be transparent about their doctrines and policies that bear upon space security. We therefore welcome those that have taken concrete steps in this regard. and we encourage others to follow their lead. A key component of transparency and an important step in building confidence is having an interactive exchange with a view to enhancing understandings, including on what constitutes responsible behavior and on the application of principles of and obligations under international space law. In this regard, we see this OEWG already as a TCBM platform. We are encouraged with the openness of delegations that participated actively this week. Another key component is to explore possible concrete measures to actualize many of the principles that are already enshrined in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. The ASEAN working paper we submitted today mentions these principles, equality amongst all states, spacefaring or otherwise, the non-appropriation of outer space, the applicability of international law in outer space. no placement of weapons of mass destruction, state responsibility and liability, the state of registry, international cooperation, and the duty of due regard. Yesterday, there were rich discussions on how to actualize the provisions on consultations, which is a voluntary tool under Article 9 of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. Dr. Raju this morning talked about the absence of a mechanism for consultations under Article 9. We believe, however, that... Consultations is a low-hanging fruit for our work, and we look forward to helping explore means to actualize this. In this regard, we would like to offer the following points. First, under Article 9, consultations are an optional tool, both for states that plan to undertake activities that it believes might affect the rights or interests of others, and also for states that believe that the activities of other states might prejudice its rights and interests. While such consultations are optional, the underlying principle of due regard requires that the threshold for undertaking this option must be minimal. We have an opportunity at this OEWG to clarify this thought further. In addition to low threshold for activation, consultations have to be meaningful. Again, we see guidance on how to make such consultations meaningful in other areas of international law, as we mentioned in our working paper. on the duty of your regard. We propose the following non-exhaustive standards for consultations. First, consultations must involve a conscious balancing of rights and interests. Second, it must include extensive concern regarding the other party's reaction, as well as suggestions of compromise and willingness to offer assurances. Third, it must include manifestation of an understanding of other party's concern in connection with any proposed activities. The bottom line for these standards is that any such consultations must be conducted in good faith and should not be merely pro forma. We have also noted other concrete examples that delegations have put forward this week on other avenues for TCBMs, and we look forward to further discussions on them throughout the next sessions of the OEWG. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S1M1012,1,10,Russia,"Mr. President. Chair, I've raised my plate. to make a general statement. If I may, then I can do it now. But as I understand it, we are continuing to discuss topic five now. And so I would ask for the floor later.",2
S1M1014,1,10,Cuba,"Thank you very much, Chairman. I would like to continue with the debate in an interactive manner and react to some of the questions that we mentioned this morning, as well as raise some of the other topics that my distinguished colleagues took note of during the week and some of the interesting issues that have been debated in this working group and that we would like to comment on. Of course, there are some very interesting proposals coming up in the political sphere, but from a legal perspective, they certainly pose challenges. I would refer to the importance of mechanisms in order to comply with existing law. Now, confidence-building measures that some delegations have been referring to are very welcome. but they are entirely insufficient. And I say entirely insufficient, not in the same vein as we always say in other contexts that they are voluntary in other words, that they have a limited scope. I'm really saying they're insufficient because in the context of this working group, this kind of measures are even more insufficient. And I hope that meaning is coming across. Now, I say this because outer space is really rather undemocratic. When we talk about responsible behaviors and the use of space, we're almost talking about responsible behavior of about 10 countries, 10 states that have had the capacity or the ability to use outer space by placing objects in outer space. If we include space activity... around celestial bodies, then we're really talking about the responsible behaviours of three nations that are the ones that have had the most significant activities in placing objects around celestial bodies. So if we're talking about confidence building measures and responsible behaviours, then the scope is really very limited indeed because for countries such as Cuba, well what our concern? is not covered. It's a question of these other states acting with due diligence and sharing information as others have suggested. Now, I am obviously speaking in a bid to have an interactive discussion and as part of this is the question of due diligence. Now, due all very well, but legally speaking, it is very limited. First of all, due diligence has got nothing to do with responsible behaviors. Due diligence is a legal concept which is born of the interpretation of courts, courts interpreting primary norms of applicable international law. When we speak about due diligence in the context of the... law of the sea, for example, then we're talking about specific norms governing conduct in the high seas in terms of scientific activity, for example. And within the convention and the law of the sea, due diligence has different levels of interpretation depending on what the primary norms of international law lay down. Now... the way that the law of the sea deals with the issue of trans border damages, for example, in cases of, for example, drilling on the continental shelf, well, there's a standard of due diligence there where some legal experts say that rather than speaking of due diligence, one should speak of the character of the activity. because in international customary law there is a regime of responsibility which is much more limited for those activities that are considered of ultra-high risk. Now why do we say this? Because due diligence in this context and within a bit of strengthening responsible behavior, it could actually be used to weaken the regime for responsibility which currently exists. to cover outer space. If you go and look at the decisions delivered by international courts, when they tackle the issue of responsibility, they always use the example of outer space to indicate, perhaps because it was the very first such regime of responsibility, that it's a question of absolute responsibility. It is the clearest case regulated in international law. So when we start speaking of due diligence and we're actually using it and applying it to different contexts, then we are saying that we're going to be establishing soft law norms of conduct which are going to be governing how we behave. But when this applies to activities such as in the law of the sea, what it means is that if a state manages to demonstrate that there has been a behaviour of due diligence, then they're not responsible for trans-border damages, for example. So due diligence in this context, instead of legally strengthening the responsibility regime, what in fact it's doing is weakening it. And I hope that I'm interpreting it correctly and that I'm not mistaken, but it could mean... that a state that has followed the norms of due diligence, that has a national register, that has clear standards to regulate the conduct of companies, for example, in the use of space, is not considered responsible for any damages if they have complied with or have followed due diligence procedures. And in different spheres of international law, that is, in fact, what happens. And it seems that this attempt to mix due diligence with what has been called in this group responsible behaviors, and in fact, nobody knows exactly what that is, could be an attempt to try and find standards of behavior which in fact water down the absolute responsibility regime in the sphere of activities in outer space. And this is why our delegation... does not view the management of concepts that are ambiguous such as responsible behavior very favorably unless we are talking about establishing more primary obligations which would establish very high standards of responsibility and to conclude and still connected with the question of mechanisms due diligence may be regulated under international customary laws and soft law, but due diligence always has to be proven, demonstrated and required before a mechanism, a mandatory mechanism to oversee. In other words, the responsibility of determining who has behaved with due diligence is a court or a tribunal and that's not a mechanism that we have in this context. There are cases where due diligence has been mentioned in international context and those examples show that developed countries that can pay many lawyers and have a well-developed mechanisms can in fact avoid responsibility when they can prove that they have had appropriate behavior with due diligence. However, when it happens... In the opposite way, when there's cross-border damages caused by a developing country, it becomes much more difficult, according to international courts, to demonstrate that this due diligence has indeed taken place. So I think we need to be very cautious indeed about where we direct our work when we speak of, or in fact attempt to define responsible behaviour. And in the view of our delegation, if this responsible behaviour is development of soft law which establishes good practice and standards. This seems to us to be a very healthy exercise, but entirely insufficient for countries such as Cuba that in terms of outer space, we're only being exposed to non peaceful uses to possible damages from outer space and. there's no talk at all of sharing technologies or exchanging, for example, when developing space mining, no talk about how we might be able to benefit from the outcome of all these activities. So I just wanted to bring these thoughts to all of us. From a political point of view, I repeat, it's all well and good to talk about these things, but legally speaking, it can be interpreted as an attempt to... weaken responsibility and it could actually promote the placing of objects in outer space or in fact even more dangerous activities. Thank you very much, Chair.",2
S1M1016,1,10,Venezuela,"Thank you very much, Chairman. To continue the debate, my delegation wishes to echo the elements in the statement delivered by the distinguished ambassador of China. We also wish to echo and endorse the thoughts developed by the delegation of Cuba, which my delegation will consider further. We have a right to participate in exploration and use of outer space, but outer space must solely be used for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of human development and the well-being of all nations, without discrimination, regardless of the level of development. It must be in compliance with international law. We restate the need that we must have a safe, stable, sustainable outer space and we must ensure that it doesn't become a theatre for conflict. We reiterate the call for all states to respect the principle of non-militarisation of outer space and that they abstain from any actions to place any weapons of any kind in outer space. The triggering... of an arms race in outer space would represent a threat to global peace and security. And the international community must prevent this by means of negotiating a legally binding instrument in order to preserve outer space as a common asset and heritage of humanity. There must be a prohibition of its use for any warlike activity. and there must be no threat or use of force against any objects that are placed in outer space. As an intermediate step, we could adopt TCBMs in relation to activities in outer space as part of peacekeeping and keeping security pursuant to the United Nations Charter. This would considerably assist in strengthening international space law. Having this kind of measure would be a step towards strengthening the existing legal framework, which could help to improve safety and security of space activities in the short and medium term and it could bolster international efforts towards adopting an international binding instrument. But in no way can it replace the actual... bringing about of a document to prevent Paros, the prevention of an arms race in outer space. And this must be the ultimate goal of our work indeed. Thank you.",4
S1M1019,1,10,Cuba,"Thank you, Chairman. I think it's a very good idea to make the best use of time, given that we're all here. I very much welcome the comments made by the delegation of Canada. There is no doubt that the terms of responsibility and liability don't have an exact translation in Spanish. In fact, they're both translated with the same word, responsabilidad, and this has certainly made things difficult for our Spanish language legal experts. But some of us have looked into these issues and do know the difference. What happens that liability... is linked in the majority of cases to damages. And that is a difference to responsibility, which according to customary law is linked to a violation of at least one norm of international law. Now, in order to have an exchange with our delegations, particularly with the delegation of Canada, we wish to make it clear that... Cuba isn't worried about a satellite dropping and landing on Havana. We want to make sure that there is effective legal remedy when there has been a violation of the principle of the peaceful use of outer space. We don't believe that it's necessary because the subsidiary regime of responsibility establishes this. It's not required for there to be damages to a person or a property or an individual for somebody to claim that has been a violation of an international law norm. Now, perhaps I haven't read every single legal instrument that's existing properly, but there is the question now of the existence of an instrument allowing for Cuba to demand a remedy because, say, somebody has placed a weapon in space and we believe that this is a violation of the principle of the peaceful use of outer space. Now, our colleague has raised the question of the ICJ. And I say, yes, that's quite right. But what happens in space is that, say, there's a group of states that doesn't recognize the rulings of the ICJ. And so here's another areas of weakness. This mechanism that could help for the peaceful settlement of disputes wouldn't be effective. countries such as Cuba could go to the ICJ and ask for another state that has placed a weapon in outer space. Cuba believes this is unacceptable because it violates international law and yet we couldn't go there because that state, the other state simply doesn't recognize the ICJ in that way. So it's an extremely complex area. And I thank our distinguished colleague from Canada for his extremely useful comments in this respect, but I still believe that it's an area that we need to reflect on more. And we really have to give a better shape to what we are discussing as responsible behaviour at the moment. And we have to really determine what the applicable mechanism to it is. Thank you.",2
S1M1021,1,10,Algeria,"Thank you, Chair. I was not planning to take the floor. But this is a very interesting interactive debate, and so I would like to share some ideas regarding our understanding of the discussions that have taken place today on the importance of voluntary measures to enhance confidence and serve the ultimate goal of preventing an arms race in outer space and maintaining the exclusively peaceful nature of space. It is our understanding that there is complementarity existing between these voluntary measures and the legal rules governing safety in space. This complementarity could be further strengthened through a common understanding of the possible linkages between the two approaches. these two approaches appear not to be mutually exclusive. And so there could be grounds for shared understanding to make progress. we should take this opportunity. as we have two ongoing parallel processes, the OEWG on responsible behavior, and the subsidiary body three within the CD. which will soon hold its session next week, in fact. A good faith signal from this group could be perceived by the subsidiary body. and there would be some understanding generated. that we can make progress within the OEWG on some voluntary norms. and enable the first steps to be taken within the CD and namely that subsidiary body. to make progress towards a legally binding instrument on space safety. This is an opportunity to be taken. as the two bodies under the same presidency, the excellent presidency of Chile. And so that is an opportunity to be taken. We also wish to underscore an important point regarding voluntary measures. These are interim by nature and complementary, and they need to be compliant with international law. and so preparing voluntary rules and respect for voluntary rules. This could be in contradiction with international legal norms and we should avoid that. It should be clarified. that voluntary norms... are perhaps the very first, the very initial step in crystallizing illegal rule. Another important aspect that I wanted to highlight. is making progress in reflections on these two approaches and there is a need to avoid further legal or normative fragmentation. This could be beneficial in terms of efforts to prevent an arms race in outer space. Ultimately, I wish to thank you warmly. for your outstanding chairmanship. You have enabled a very constructive exchange. We highly commend the very active and constructive contributions from delegations and panelists. and we are especially satisfied with the affirmation that we have heard throughout the work of the session. regarding the commitment to the purposes of the Outer Space Treaty and the commitment to the peaceful nature of outer space. This will facilitate the group's work and the work of the subsidiary body on Paros. I thank you.",1
S1M1023,1,10,Canada,"My delegation has been listening with great interest to the presentations and the discussions that have taken place this week, and we are very appreciative for all of the delegates' thoughtful and constructive contributions. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on some of the points that have been raised and which Canada finds particularly important to emphasize. I was struck by the parallels drawn by Mr. Stotler yesterday when he discussed the development of the legal regime for aviation. particularly when he noted that in the middle of the 20th century, airplanes were seen as one of the most lethal and dangerous security threats facing states, a technology that was easily considered dual purpose. But Mr. Stotler noted that, with the recognition of the significant benefits to be derived from aviation, states were able to develop norms and standards of behavior that were to the benefit of all, and which has resulted in the effective regulation and management of both civil and military aviation. Some of those norms were incorporated into treaties, particularly for civil aviation, while others remained voluntary or became a part of customary international law. It seems that in relation to space, we find ourselves in the same position as we were in the early stages of aviation, trying to determine acceptable standards of behavior, particularly as this applies to security. But we should find it reassuring to see that as we have so successfully managed to govern aviation to benefit of all states, we can find a way to effectively manage the space domain. As this week is focused on taking stock of the existing international legal regime and normative frameworks concerning space, it's worth reiterating that international law applies to outer space activities, and that includes IHL. I would like to emphasize that it is erroneous to assume that if we do not define the laws under which states should conduct themselves, if an armed conflict were to occur in space, then that means armed conflict in space will not occur. No problem has ever been avoided by ignoring it. To agree that IHL applies in space does not mean that we can don't a conflict in space. We have also heard a few states this week express the idea that the result of the OEWG's work would divide states into two categories, responsible or irresponsible, and that doing so would be subjective, not based on legislation, and would risk politicization. We need to be careful about how we characterize the work of this OEWG. Responsible and irresponsible are labels we are applying to behaviors, not to states. Any state can conduct irresponsible or irresponsible behavior. be it intentionally or inadvertently. The purpose of our work is to reach consensus on the parameters of responsible behaviors that foster trust, confidence, and ultimately enhance space security, while identifying irresponsible behaviors that cause mistrust, misperceptions, and insecurity that can lead to conflict and fuel an arms race in outer space. I want to conclude on a positive note and say that while there have been points of contention and areas of disagreement expressed this week, it is worth underscoring a number of important points on which we all agree. First, we all wish to preserve the use of space for peaceful purposes and for it to remain a domain free from conflict. Second, we all recognize the need to ensure space remains accessible for all states to use. Third, all states have expressed in some form agreement with the principle of due regard, and it is now just a matter of understanding how this translates into conduct and behaviors. And finally, we are all in agreement that we ultimately want to prevent an arms race in outer space. The work of this OEWG is a significant part of that effort. Chair, thank you for the way you have conducted the work of the group over this past week. The discussions have been substantive, and we look forward to engaging with all delegations in future sessions. Thank you.",1
S1M1025,1,10,Japan,"And in this context, we would like to reiterate Japan's position that we welcome and support U.S. and Canada's announcement not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile testing as a positive step towards formulating norms of responsible behaviors in outer space. And the second point is that many refer to the need to take the dual-use nature into account. And the panels have presented. the dual use and dual purpose, the distinction between the two, which we found very useful, as the behaviors that we tried to focus in this open-ended working group does not mean only shedding light on capacity. Rather, we should focus on how such capacity is used and what effect it causes. The third point is a shared sense of urgency. on the need to tackle space security as it affects us all. And we find that there is a very strong need for a pragmatic way forward, and we look forward to fostering common understanding on behaviors that are conducive to enhancing space security, while simultaneously fostering common understandings on behaviors that are detrimental to space security, which is indeed the subject of the next session of this OEWG. And we look forward to the future. to and will commit to our active engagement throughout this OEWG to enhance space security, which will indeed be conducive to preventing an arms race in outer space. Thank you, Chair.",1
S1M1027,1,10,Netherlands,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor. Having listened to our debates the last few days, I think we can safely say that these have been constructive and that many important topics have been addressed. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, Mr. Chair, wholeheartedly for organizing these sessions and inviting all the relevant speakers. We have been in very, very good hands, Mr. Chair. Having given some thoughts to the results of this meeting, my delegation would make the following. remarks. First, my delegation would like to confirm that the Kingdom of the Netherlands considers that in line with Article 3 of the Outer Space Treaty and Articles 2 and 3 of the Moon Agreement, outer space activities must be carried out in conformity with international law. Therefore, international law, including the UN Charter, IHL and LOAC, are applicable in outer space. It seems to the Kingdom of the Netherlands that the obligation of do-regard, so clearly provided for in Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty, is the core principle to adhere to for the reduction of threats in outer space. Many other principles of behavior flow from this obligation, such as the sharing of information and other TCBMs. However, what constitutes do-regard is different for each situation, and therefore, My delegation would not be inclined to enter into an exercise of defining the scope of the obligation of due regard. We would have similar considerations with respect to other obligations already part of international space law. Third, and simultaneously, we consider that it is possible to develop further rules, in particular rules that prohibit certain behavior. During this meeting... We have spoken at length about ASET tests and the Unilateral Declaration of the United States not to carry out any further destructive, direct ascent ASET tests. This is an example of behavior, a prohibition of which may be explored. There may be other conducts or behaviors that could be prohibited for constituting irresponsible behavior. It would be preferable to ensure that such prohibitions are legally binding. and will be accompanied by appropriate mechanisms for verification. However, these binding rules may need to develop over time and we may therefore start with establishing best practices, norms and guidelines and we may take inspiration from the development of international environmental law. Finally, the Netherlands would also recall the importance of the peaceful settlement of disputes and in that regard would echo the words of our distinguished colleague from Australia also referenced to by Canada. My delegation would encourage all member states of the UN that have not yet done so to accept a compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice by issuing a declaration under Article 36, paragraph 2 of the statute, and to do so with as few reservations as possible. Finally, Mr. Chair, my delegation looks forward to the next session of this open-ended working group. We think we have made important progress during this session. and we're confident that we can continue to work in good spirits of cooperation. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S1M1029,1,10,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Chair. At the outset, I wish to thank you. I thank you, Chair, for the excellent organisation of work, and I thank the delegations for the work in this session of the OEWG. We are convinced. that your efforts will ensure that the next session is also at the same high organisational level. We also thank all experts for their comprehensive briefings during the session. They contained several interesting ideas and considerations which deserve serious attention and further elaboration. I also thank the delegations for interactive participation in discussions on difficult issues and for giving their views. We view this session of the working group as a kind of theoretical beginning for the next session at which delegations will have to discuss the potential outcome recommendations on responsible behaviour. However, during the session, in our view, we did not quite manage to achieve a single understanding of what is meant by responsible behaviour in outer space, what its criteria are. what mechanisms there might be to define it. and how to determine what is responsible behaviour by states and what constitutes irresponsible behaviour. who and how will be giving such an assessment. All of these remain open questions for the time being. Furthermore, in our view, we need a clear understanding of what we are discussing. Because in some statements by delegations, there was a parallel drawn between conduct in space and specific actions in space, which constitutes space activities, for instance, space manoeuvres. Is that conduct or is it an activity? Here we need to also reach an understanding about the delineation between the various terms and how they overlap. We also need to understand that without answers to these questions, we will encounter several difficulties. when we are considering the possible recommendations. In my view, aside from what I've mentioned, there are other grey areas. These require further consideration. In particular, I am referring to arbitrary use of risks and threats relating to outer space. and also they're interlinked with the task of preventing an arms race in outer space. Until we reach a common understanding of this toolkit of terms, we will struggle to counter space threats. and these threats have a negative impact on international security. It will be problematic to discuss the ways and means of curbing these threats as well. We noted that some states are actively promoting the concept of hostile intentions. by which they endeavour to mean several actions in space. these in their view could constitute irresponsible behavior. These include space maneuvers, approach to spacecraft or changing their orbit. We deem this manner of approaching things, this approach to be very improper. as this could lead to some discriminatory framework towards states who conduct space activities. In this regard, we note that any action in space, if it does not violate the norms and rules governing space activities, is completely legal and responsible. unilateral interpretation of them. based on national foreign policy considerations. Deeming them a threat contradicts existing international law, including international space law. We also should have a detailed consideration of dual use space technologies in our view. as this is crucially important to determine threats and also the nature of states' space activities and activities by other participants. In particular, I wish to address the topic of applicability of IHL. I wish to affirm our position that this is premature and inappropriate. that is to consider the applicability of IHL to space activities. international humanitarian law and law in armed conflicts have a specific scope. This is protecting the victims of war and the rules of conduct of military hostilities. therefore the discussions of the applicability or non applicability of IHL. automatically entail a conclusion about armed conflicts arising in outer space. In this context, we deem it necessary to recall once again that in keeping with international law and international space law, activities conducted in space and on celestial bodies are only possible for peaceful purposes. All of humanity wishes to see progress in the use of space specifically for peaceful purposes, and this is reflected in the fundamental outer space treaty of 1967. Maintaining the use of space exclusively for peaceful purposes is important and it is an integral task for all states without exception. We believe that the discussion on the applicability of IHL to space activities can only bring us closer to a situation whereby military capabilities appear in space and weapons will be deployed which could... fall under certain norms of international law. We believe that until such a time comes... And this is something that Russia hopes will never happen. considering the applicability of IHL in space is premature. Furthermore, I wish to note that when we discuss the applicability of IHL... we are losing sight of the fact. that this is part of international law as a whole. However, as a part of international law... and existing alongside other areas of international law. activation or application of some areas of international law. is an issue. to be decided in various means, depending on the specific circumstances, the conditions. during which that area of law is being used. For instance... You cannot apply international law governing peacekeeping operations. if a peacekeeping operation has not been deployed. That law does exist, but it is only applicable, it only enters into force if there is a peacekeeping operation being conducted. The same is true for IHL. This is the law of international conflicts. And so its applicability is brought about by the start of a conflict. And what we are discussing here is prevention. of conflicts. Furthermore, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the head of the US delegation for his comments and the question raised as well. And they rightly noted that the problem of preventing conflicts in outer space has long been on the agenda of the international community. If we consider the issue of preventing an arms race in outer space in a broad context, then the issue of preventing conflicts in space has been discussed at the very least since 1967. But if we want to be serious and comprehensive in our discussion of the issue of conflicts in outer space, then we must begin from the very start, if you will, with answers to a range of questions. I'm referring to the following in particular. is outer space in its nature an environment for conflicts. what legal regime applies to outer space. In international space law, international law, are there current provisions indicating that space activities contain elements that could lead to conflict or to an armed confrontation in space? What is the legal framework for space activities? And what happens if an armed conflict arises in outer space? what preconditions can there be for a conflict to break out in outer space? what is the level of reality of a conflict breaking out in the current historical conditions. At what stage do we have the best opportunity to prevent a conflict in outer space? how can a unilateral assessment of risks and threats in outer space be, how can it be adequate enough in its reflection of the state of affairs in outer space and the legal regime? How can these unilateral assessments? influence the thinking process of the international community regarding the nature of outer space, the character of space activities, challenges and threats in space, from space and towards space, in respect to space. What ways and means can be used to avoid a conflict in space at the various stages? at the various stages of it coming to fruition being a reality. And that is far from an exhaustive list of questions which we should discuss. regarding the prevention of an arms race in outer space. The Russian Federation does have answers to most of these questions, but so as to avoid taking up valuable time, I will not go into them. and to avoid imposing our position on delegations. I simply wish to note one thing, that the Russian Federation stands ready to conduct bilateral and multilateral dialogue to find varied answers to these questions and others that relate to international security and safety in outer space. However, I wish to underscore again that the Russian Federation is convinced that even in the current conditions, the international community does have a good opportunity to adopt measures to maintain space as a conflict-free zone. and an area for cooperation between states. which will be used and explored only for peaceful purposes. I also wish to address the moratorium adopted by the United States against ASAT tests. In principle, we view this initiative as a positive signal that the United States is prepared to move from criticism of existing initiatives. to introducing and making a practical contribution towards preventing an arms race in outer space. However... We believe that this measure is very limited and intended to resolve a rather narrow issue relating to the absence of a ban on conventional weapons in outer space. I wish to note the following. The U.S. initiative was proposed back when ASAT capabilities became a reality. And the US is not only a long-standing holder of such capabilities, but has also tested such capabilities more than once. Therefore, this attractive idea of a moratorium is not related to barriers to ASAT systems. And second. Outside the framework of this moratorium is the use of ASAT systems that do not destroy space objects. And third, the moratorium does not relate to preventing an arms race in outer space, as it does not prevent the deployment of weapons or their use in outer space. In our view, the introduction of a unilateral moratorium by the US is divorced from the concerns which over two decades the US had voiced regarding the development and stepping up of ASAT capabilities. Fifth. The moratorium on testing does not hinder testing military capabilities towards, from or in regard to space. In this context, I would stress that paragraph two of the PPWT. has a provision on the ban of use or threat of force against space objects. In general. we believe that the moratorium is declarative for the most part and is only intended to divert the attention of the international community from the US's true intentions, which are clearly set out in their doctrines on space. I am referring to their desire for military dominance and supremacy. viewing space as an arena for confrontation. Furthermore... by embarking on such a campaign. The US has not defined an anti-satellite weapon. and they have not provided for verification mechanisms regarding these measures, which they stated many times regarding the Russian initiative for non-first placement of weapons in outer space. and there is no obligations regarding future development of such systems which have ASAT capabilities. which the US and its allies do have. Therefore, this measure is only declarative and will hardly have any practical significance. In this regard, we would recall that since the 1950s, the U.S. has consistently had a policy of using outer space for military operations and deploying offensive weapon systems to establish military supremacy and dominance. to achieve total dominance in outer space. The goals are set out in the space strategy and the document on space forces of the United States. Among in line with these, the US and its allies are implementing large scale programs involving the threat and use of force in space, from space and in regard of space. including as a preventive measure. This refers mainly to creating space-based anti-missile installations. including interception capabilities and ways to affect the orbit infrastructure. I also wish to underscore that in 2008 the United States had already conducted a test of its anti-satellite capabilities by shooting down the SM-3 rocket and its own 193 US rocket. I also recall that in the 1980s... The US tested an anti-satellite weapon on the F-15A aircraft. And in the 1990s, they tested an anti-satellite laser system that is air-based. The potential for weapons use in outer space is something that they also have on X-37B. this is able to stay in orbit for an extended period of time, conduct maneuvers. and is able to carry civilian and military payloads. We therefore believe... that this moratorium is clearly insufficient to achieve the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. We believe that the best way to demonstrate that the US is striving to achieve an outer space that is free of weapons. would be participation by the US in negotiations on a legally binding instrument with guarantees of non-first placement, non-use or threat of force against space objects. In conclusion... I wish to thank you, Chair, for giving us your views on how to organise the further work of our group. You may count on the full support of the Russian delegation. We set great store by the intersessional process during which states cannot only set out their position papers. but also cooperate closely through informal consultations, for instance. or by having a regular exchange of views regarding the previous session or discussions for upcoming sessions. Thank you, Chair.",4
S1M1031,1,10,Iran,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. Let me first appreciate the panelists during the past few days. Their presentations were interesting and in parallel with you thought provoking and we listened them attentively. We would like also to share some comments in this regard. We also thank you for your very open conduct of these meetings. Mr. Chairman, it is a matter of concern that a military alliance declared outer space as an operational domain. A country designated the outer space as a war fighting domain and some other countries established space command and these are all against the principle enshrined in the UN Charter and the 1967 Space Treaty. In such a challenging situation, the international community is facing security challenges and threats emanating from the ever-increasing weaponization and militarization of outer space. Having said that, let me share the following comments and observations. First, it is clear that any wrong act in outer space has severe consequences on Earth. In accordance with Article 2 of the Outer Space Treaty, using space as exclusive zone is prohibited as it stipulates that outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means. Beyond the observation that our distinguished colleague from China referred to with regard to the application of IHL to outer space, if we accept such an application, does the party of international armed conflict have the right to capture and detain astronauts, as most of them are members of the other party's armed forces, while the states are obliged to secure, to rescue and return astronauts as the invoice of mankind under Article 5 of the Outer Space Treaty? Second, we believe the definitions are as important as laying the foundation for any possible further work before a conduct can be labeled as responsible or irresponsible. If we are supposed to design a legal framework, it is imperative to have a common understanding with regard to basic principles in a legal binding approach. Therefore, it is vital to have a legal framework and a clear definition. that elements are going to be used for responsible conduct of states. Third, the most pressing issue facing the international community with regard to outer space are the prevention of an arm race in outer space, prevention of weaponization of outer space, as well as assurances that outer space will be used solely for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all countries. be free for exploration and used by all states without discrimination of any kind on the basis of equality and in accordance with the international law and facilitating encouraging of international cooperation. Fourth, the responsibility of states with regard to public and private entities, activities in a space. States should be held accountable for their private companies in a space. Fifth, The OST represents the basic legal framework of international space law. UNOSA has reaffirmed the following principle as the core principles of the treaty. The exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interest of all countries and shall be the providence of all mankind. And outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means or use of occupation, or by any other means. policies and activities of some states are in direct violation of these principles. How those program and policies could be perceived as in line with the principles governing the outer space. Last but not least, we have heard during this session many references were made to different aspects of prevention of an arm race in outer space. While this is an inspiring thing indicating that importance of However, at the same time, many references were made to responsible or irresponsible, accepted or unaccepted behaviors as if it is not taken for granted and as if there are consensus on the issue of the so-called responsible behavior. If this working group is tasked to deal with some aspect of pharaohs or... is supposed to duplicate the work of the city or cupules which are dealing with the security and safety of outer space. And we should know that this is the common aspiration of the international community. These observations can continue, Mr. Chairman. However, I just refer to some of them. That is why my delegation is of the view that cherry-picking and selective approach would not be in the benefit of all countries. and lead to more division. We think that any approaches that limit or prevent free access of all states, particularly the developing countries, are unacceptable. The best way to tackle the threats to space or originating them from the domain is through a comprehensive and multilateral approach that would encompass all aspects related to outer space. including prevention of an armed race in outer space, prevention of militarization and weaponization of outer space, along with the commitment to explore and use outer space for peaceful purposes that can guarantee the international cooperation and capacity building in particular for the benefit of developing country. Mr. Chairman, having said that, this week's discussion should, shows that there approaches regarding the Paris. One which is yet firmly believes that the long-standing mandate of the Paris in the form of negotiating of a legal binding document. And secondly, is the approach that responsible behavior which is contested are the best way in the way of discussing the issues related to Paris. So in our view, the second approach should not be taken for granted in the discussion. And both contending views should be duly reflected in any outcome of this OEWG, and we hope that it also be reflected in your chair summary. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.",4
S1M1034,1,10,Cuba,"Thank you very much, Chairman. I will attempt to be as concise as possible. My first words are to commend you for your responsible behavior as you've stewarded our work. I think that gives a very good pattern to our group of work and it's really not been at all a politicized group that leads to sterile discussions. So I welcome everything that you've said and I trust that you know that we have participated constructively, although you know what our doubts are about the creation of this working group where there are at least three other groups that we believe overlap the work of this one. We are convinced that our future work will have to shed some more light on some very serious doubts that still remain and that we will have to identify further areas of study. We really have to be very clear about... how we want to focus our work in order to make a contribution to the debate. Your proposal of debates with experts mixed with debates between states, we believe is a good one. You can proceed in that way with our full support. We believe that will help to clarify and shed light on important points. Now, even if it's in a preliminary manner, I would ask you to circulate before time the topics and the experts that you plan to invite so that we can make a constructive contribution to that because it's very easy to criticise after you circulate the list and to say that the topics aren't exactly what we want because we have restricted view when we simply... contemplate the behavior of states and not the behavior of companies and corporations, for example, or when we open debate to areas that we don't believe are unnecessary, such as civilian protection or IHL. We believe that any action or behaviour in outer space that could form part of a conflict or military activities connected of a conflict is per se a violation of international law. And therefore it's not necessary to add anything else because it's an absolute prohibition. And we don't want this weakened in any way or fashion. I would like to suggest a group of very tangible specific topics which can be considered at some point in the future. In fact, we could also suggest some experts and I would say that they're not Cuban experts. They don't even share our own points of view, but they are the main legal experts in the world at the moment in terms of responsibility and liability just to mention one issue. We think that in future work it's very important, one, to determine where the areas of weakness are in applicable law, two, to talk about the existing relationship between an age-old concept in international law, which is acts of state and what we intend by state behavior. And I'm still not clear about what we intend by that. I think we need to know what the difference is. between the two and that's leaving to one side the question of responsible or non-responsible that we obviously also need to discuss. I think in future it would also be very interesting to discuss all of these behaviors that we want to regulate and tie this in with existing norms of responsibility and liability in applicable international law. A fourth possible topic could be the role of third parties. For example, it's not possible for... There can be no claim made by an individual who feels affected if the two states that are claiming responsibility do not agree to this, but this could be a topic to be discussed. And a fifth possible issue... We've talked about voluntary mechanisms. We could actually discuss the issue of mandatory or customary mechanisms for application of the law. And a final issue would be the question of international cooperation and possible mechanisms to implement the principle of common use of existing resources in space and in celestial bodies for the benefit of all. So I commend you once again, Chairman, for your wise stewardship. and I assure you that we will continue to contribute to your work and that of other delegations. Thank you.",2
S1M1036,1,10,United Kingdom,"We have the floor, sir. Thank you Mr. Chair. I will try to make my intervention brief but I can at least promise it won't be the longest statement we hear this afternoon. Let me begin though by joining others in paying tribute to the way in which you have both prepared for and steered the work of our group this week. My delegation welcomes the interesting and interactive discussion that we've had with experts and amongst delegations. The structure of our work and the selection of the briefers has been highly conducive to a deep and rich discussion. There have been many specific ideas proposed and we all have lots of food for thought ahead of our next session in September and I want to thank you and your team for the work you've done to make that happen. This has of course been the first meeting of the new process set up by the UN General Assembly pursuant to the mandate set out in Resolution 76.231. That resolution and mandate builds itself on the excellent report by the Secretary-General pursuant to Resolution 75.36. This is a comprehensive and multilateral process open to all states, the goal of which is the prevention of an arms race in outer space. The specific aim is to include in our pursuit of that goal a wide range of threats in orbit and from the Earth, and to avoid miscalculation and escalation that could lead to conflict. One key innovation of this group is its focus on behaviours as a means of addressing threats to space systems to achieve the prevention of an arms race. Space systems, as we all know, are crucial for national, regional, and global security and stability, and attacks against any of the four segments that they comprise would harm international security, as well as the need to keep outer space open and accessible to all. Allow me to share four general reflections on the discussions this week. First, we have had useful exchanges about the scope of this body's work and how it intersects with that of others. We agree with the view that risks, such as accidents, and dangers or hazards, such as space weather, fall under the heading of safety, not security, and are more suited to discussion within copious. States' space systems enable them to deliver prosperity, development, and security. But the intentional development, testing, and potential use of capabilities and techniques by states to target the space systems of other states threaten all of these and should be discussed in this forum. Second, we have heard many references to the need for space to be used for exclusively peaceful purposes. Let us be clear, militaries operate in space and have done so since the beginning of space exploration and the use of space by militaries is not of itself incompatible with the idea of peaceful use. The responsible behaviors approach can help ensure space continues to be used for peaceful purposes by reducing the risk of aggression. which might arise from misunderstandings and miscalculations both in space and on Earth. Third, we acknowledge that many delegations have reiterated their firm support for legally binding mechanisms to address space security issues. We welcome that some delegations emphasized the requirement for legally binding instruments to be verifiable and expressed the view that the responsible behaviors approach could both support the development of future legally binding instruments. and complement existing and future legal frameworks. Fourth, we reiterate our hope that the process of states developing and agreeing norms and principles of responsible behaviors can mitigate threats and that the outcome of that process could be crystallized into legally binding rules in due course. In the meantime, collective understandings on what constitutes responsible behavior will contribute to building trust and transparency and to collective self-restraint. in the development and deployment of capabilities. Having listened carefully to all views expressed throughout the week, we remain convinced that the focus of this open-ended working group on responsible behaviours is a promising avenue for the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Mr Chair, the focus of our work this week has been on taking stock of the existing international, legal and other normative frameworks concerning threats arising from state behaviours with respect to outer space. We have heard from a number of policy, academic, and legal experts, as well as a large number of delegations expressing a wide range of views. It has been a stimulating, fruitful, constructive, and timely discussion, and my delegation is grateful for the engagement of all who have contributed to it. It is clear that international law applies to activities of states in outer space, including the UN Charter and customary international law. and we welcome the helpful discussions on a wide range of elements of the existing legal framework. There has been widespread agreement amongst experts and member states that the laws of armed conflict apply in outer space and that all states must comply with them. The responsible behaviors approach can help avoid conflict in the first place and spare us from situations where there is a necessity to determine how the requirements of the law of armed conflict would apply, noting that the law of armed conflict imposes limits on the conduct of armed through applicable principles such as distinction proportionality and so on, which we have heard is highly challenging in a space context. It is also clear, however, that there are a number of activities or scenarios which would not clearly be prohibited under existing international law, but which could nevertheless be threatening to space systems or to international peace and security and would therefore be undesirable or irresponsible. As a number of speakers have noted, We can either bury our heads in the sand and wish away the risk of space conflict, or we can consider how international law applies to activities in space that might be carried out in the furtherance of an armed conflict, with the aim of ensuring that conflict does not occur. There was also an interesting discussion on the lessons to be learned from the legal framework that applies to the air and the sea. These are very broad frameworks, and it is important that we focus in this group on finding practical ideas and mechanisms that help address threats by reducing risks of misinterpretation and miscalculation leading to conflict. We believe the discussions this week have emphasised that an extensive body of obligations under international law already exists and that states must comply with those obligations. In this open-ended working group, we have an opportunity to build on the legal framework through the creation of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours. And that is the task that we must turn our efforts to over the rest of this open-ended working group. Finally then, Mr. Chair, my delegation looks forward to the next session in September, which will focus on current and future threats to space systems. We have already heard this afternoon that this discussion is timely and urgent. We welcome the approach you have just set out, which has served us well this week. We hope this session in September will be useful in increasing our collective understanding of the full range of threats to space systems and point the way towards developing norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours to manage and reduce those threats. building on the existing legal foundations in line with the mandate of the group. With that Mr. Chair, once again I thank you for your efforts this week and once again we look forward to working with you in the intersessional period and furthermore in September. Thank you.",1
S1M1038,1,10,Australia,"Thank you Chair. At the outset, Australia wishes to congratulate you on the way you have conducted these discussions. We appreciate the expert presentations from our panellists this week and request that you pass on our gratitude. Finally, we would also like to thank all delegations for their active and constructive engagement this week. This week illustrated that the Space Governance Framework comprises of both binding and non-binding instruments. Legal regimes of other domains, including aviation and sea law, can also usefully inform the development of appropriate norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours in outer space. Australia fully supports discussions and clarification of how international law applies in outer space. We do not accept the proposition that such discussions legitimise warfare in space. On the contrary, we think that building a shared understanding of how existing international law, including IHL, applies to outer space contributes to a more predictable and stable world order. It can also contribute to further strengthening and development of our legal and normative framework by clarifying what already applies. In relation to IHL, Australia considers it likely that certain customary international law obligations related to the protection of civilians and civilian objects, which do not have any territorial limitations, apply to conflict conducted in outer space. These rules include the principles of distinction, proportionality, necessity, requirement of precautionary measures, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, and prohibition of using means and methods of warfare that cause superfluous injury. Chair, we've listened carefully to the delegations that call for legally binding instruments as a core outcome of this open-ended working group. As we have heard this week, legally binding rules and non-binding norms are not mutually exclusive and can be complementary. The development of non-binding norms and responsible behaviours can play a critical role in enhancing space, safety, sustainability and security. As we heard from Dr Martinez earlier today, non-binding norms can lead to the development of legally binding instruments. The development of new law is necessarily an iterative process. We should focus on substance over form. States first need to have a shared understanding about precisely what needs to be regulated before calling for a new legally binding instrument. Finally, in addition to the important work of the Open Ender Working Group, I wish to note that Australia will be engaging on the latest draft of the Womera Manual, an international research project that seeks to articulate and clarify how international law applies to outer space. This is an important process and we encourage all states to engage. Australia supports a behaviours-based approach and the work of the Open Ender Working Group to help reduce the risks of threats and miscalculations. These discussions are an important part of Paris considerations. In the next session, we'll explore the threats to space systems. The distinguished delegates from Pakistan and the Russian Federation have today framed a broad range of challenges that are of concern to them. And Dr Wang on Tuesday presented a number of scenarios in his examination of armed attack. We encourage delegations to consider such threats and return in September with ideas on how a behaviour-based approach might help to address these concerns. We thank you for your kind attention.",1
S1M1040,1,10,Korea,"Mr. Chair, my delegation wishes thank you for your excellent leadership over the past week and before. Without it, our discussion could have drilled out into the never-ending space and perhaps crash into the graveyard orbits. Fortunately, we have achieved good progress towards our mission of reaching an agreement on a set of norms, rules, and principles of response behavior pertaining to space security. And this responsive behavior concept is directly related to the entire world, even as the number of countries operating at least one satellite is around 70, 80, according to the statistics. We are encouraged to affirm that there was a general agreement on the need to pursue our work in a holistic manner in light of the particular nature of the space domain and the activities conducted therein. Through reviewing the applicability of existing international legal and voluntary regimes, we could also affirm that appropriate and feasible transparency and confidence-building measures are required not only to reduce space threats, but also to gravitate us towards an international legal space security regime in the future. As such, we should build on the good work done this week and prepare ourselves for the next rounds of OEWG in reaching a goal of achieving a global security strategy. common understanding or common grounds vis-a-vis defining space threats and most importantly, identifying a set of responsible behaviors in the space security domain that would be distinct from those required for space safety and civilian use. In closing, the allocated funds is commitment to contribute in a constructive manner. And once again, thank you, Mr. Chair and all participants. and panelists, interpreters, with their active participation and contributions in our joint pursuit for safe, secure, and sustainable space environment. Muchas gracias.",1
S1M1042,1,10,New Zealand,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Let me begin by conveying our thanks to you, to the expert panel members, the Secretariat and the interpreters. Your efforts have ensured a productive conversation this week, and I'd also like to echo your observation earlier on the value of diversity in our expert panels. We welcome the participation and thoughtful engagement of our fellow delegates as well. This discussion has been enriching and sets us on a good path for the next two years. We welcome the overwhelming recognition and affirmation that international law, including the UN Charter, applies in relation to activities in outer space. The past few meetings this week have demonstrated that there are many overlapping and complex issues arising under current international legal regimes in relation to new space activities, technologies, and uses of space. The panel speakers have provided invaluable insight into some of these regimes and their possible applicability in the space context. We can draw clear guidance from existing international law. In some cases, but in many cases, there is a lack of specificity or established understanding of how international law may apply or govern certain conduct. This isn't an impediment. Rather, it's an opportunity for the OEWG. It demonstrates the areas where states can best focus or concentrate efforts to consider behaviors that would be responsible in such contexts. Convergence and eventually consensus on these behaviors can then build trust among space actors, providing clarity where instruction is lacking. and provide the basis for any future discussions on legally binding instruments. Chair, international law is foundational to consideration of what may be responsible or irresponsible behaviour in outer space. This includes several legal regimes including international humanitarian law, but also law of the sea and law governing aviation. We stress however that in affirming the applicability of those various legal regimes such as international humanitarian law, it does not by itself, does not allow in itself any particular acts. Rather, applicability of such rules affirms that states can and will be held responsible under rules of international law in space as they are on Earth for their actions and the actions of those attributable to them. Thank you, Chair, and we look forward to our next meeting in September.",1
S1M1044,1,10,New Zealand,"Thank you Mr. Chair, but looking at the time I would suggest yielding the floor to our colleague from China so we can benefit from interpretation if that would be possible. Since the other speakers would presumably speak in English.",2
S1M1046,1,10,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I thank the colleague from Philippine for your accommodation. My statement will be very brief because earlier this afternoon I have made a statement on the work of this week and our work, our next session of the work. And I believe China's views and the views of other colleagues expressed this afternoon will help. you Mr. Chair to complete the summary of the work in this week as well as for your preparation for the next session. Taking this opportunity I would like to thank and congratulate you on your leadership in this week and I look forward to the consultation with you during the inter-sessional period before the next session. I take the floor at this time because I would like to share with all of you. that I heard yesterday was the birthday of your son. I think the success of this session should be a best birthday gift to your son in addition to the chocolate from Switzerland. So I think all colleagues at present would like to say happy birthday to your son. And I wish you all a safe journey back to your country. And we look forward. to continue our work here under your leadership. Thank you.",2
S1M1048,1,10,Philippines,"My delegation congratulates you on your successful stewardship of the first session of the OEWG. We thank the experts who enriched our discussions, the delegations that engaged substantively and constructively, and our non-state partners that contributed to our work this week. This week our group took stock of existing international law, but my delegation was never under the impression that revising or reinterpreting international law is part of our mandate. What we did is a survey of existing legal and normative framework as a first step towards the fulfillment of our mandate. I wish to emphasize and reiterate the following points. First, we strongly reaffirm the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law in outer space. Second, we reaffirm that the work of these OEWG must not substitute our work on preventing an arms race in outer space through a legally binding instrument. Third, we further affirm that the OEWG's work must build on or complement the work of other processes across the multilateral fora. We therefore thank your initiative to invite the chairs of the other relevant processes at the beginning of this session. We benefited immensely from their wisdom. Fourth, it is urgent to tackle space security given the importance of space assets to all states but most specially developing countries. Fifth. Characterizing responsible behavior is an important innovation of this OEWG. This must not be construed as singling out certain states. Our work must remain inclusive and guided by good faith. Sixth, the duty of due regard is foundational. Responsible behavior is rooted in having due regard to the rights and interests of others, as well as of that of the wider international community. The duty of due regard is a legally binding obligation under international space law. but it remains open textured. This OEWG is an opportunity to clarify what jury guard means. Other regimes of international law, especially the law of the sea, provides useful guidance in this regard. Looking at the examples of these other regimes is useful to the extent that they inform our attempt to clarify and explore potential measures that could provide concrete expression to the duty of jury guard. Seventh, this OEWG is already an excellent platform for TCBM. We should continue to exchange views in good faith and in a transparent manner, and to clarify and compare our understandings of legal principles and obligations with a view to arriving at common understandings that will strengthen and not weaken existing legal and normative frameworks. Mr. Chair, we look forward to characterizing current and future threats to space systems and actions, activities and omissions that could be considered irresponsible in our next session.",1
S1M1050,1,10,Portugal,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. And at the outset, my delegation thanks you and your team, as well as the panelists and our interpreters for all your remarkable work and tireless work you have done in preparation for this session and during this session. And we also thank you in advance for the wrap-up work you still have to do and in preparation for our next session. Portugal fully shares the assessment, Mr. Chair, that you have made this afternoon about this week's discussions. We feel that this was a very fruitful, very collaborative session, and we appreciate the active engagement of all delegations in the room, including those of civil society. Mr. Chair, because the hour runs late, my delegation wishes to reiterate a single point that we have made throughout this week. which is that international law, including international humanitarian law, applies to outer space and in outer space. Arguing that this group should refrain from discussing certain issues, such as international humanitarian law, defeats the purpose of this OEWG and the added value it brings in relation to the work of previous groups on outer space activities. Hoping that an armed conflict never happens in outer space is not enough. Responsible behaviors relating to IHL obligations that are applicable during peacetime can and should be discussed in this group. Furthermore, space objects already play an important part in current armed conflict. So even if a prohibition of weapons in outer space is reached, states and humanitarian actors will still have to deal with the consequences. that certain acts regarding those space objects in space, already in orbit, can have in persons and objects protected under IHL. So Portugal, again, underlines that discussing the application of IHL rather than its applicability should be our collective focus in this group, and it's instrumental in building confidence and transparency and in promoting responsible behaviors. Mr. Chair, in conclusion, Portugal looks forward to the next session of this OEWG, and we thank you for your intelligent guidance and for your good humor. And we hope that the Chair and all delegations remain this motivated in this cooperative and inclusive process. Thank you, Mr. President.",1
S1M1052,1,10,Pakistan,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chapperson. And since my delegation has made a detailed statement outlining our position, I promise you this will be much more shortened than that. I do appreciate the opportunity to briefly reflect on an informative and interesting week and a productive week of discussions. And in this and what in this delegation's point of view are some very brief takeaways or areas of work to look into going forward. And of course, this is not an exhaustive list. And the first one I. I'm going to pick from your thoughts, which is number one, it is making progress is a common interest. Number two, principles of UN Charter, which were crafted and agreed by humankind, they remain valid when human beings go to outer space. Number three, the unique nature, status and approach to this domain, which does not mean that we cannot learn from efforts elsewhere, but to ensure that this domain remains peaceful. and to the benefit of all rather than finding ways to govern a conflict in outer space. Number four, the centrality of preserving the international consensus on Paros and ensuring that our work contributes to Paros, the very item under which the G resolution was adopted. Number five, the importance of tackling the array of threats to outer space and from outer space and trying to identify how to start Paros negotiations. the need of focusing on the security dimension rather than safety aspects. Number seven, questions on what entails a behaviors based approach would need to be answered. Further discussions are our discussions further reveal that the links to and dependency of behaviors to capabilities would remain inescapable. Number eight, some core principles would need to be affirmed or reaffirmed by this working group. My delegation has suggested three such principles. We hope others would enrich this further. And number nine, we've also heard thoughts on possible norms this working group can help develop, including this delegation's suggestion regarding placement of weapons. Other suggestions have also been made. These could also be useful ideas to work on. And finally, a holistic and comprehensive approach to security in outer space. In this regard also, my delegation has proposed three topics which we request you to appropriately consider placing in our deliberations during the second and third week. Which brings me Mr. Chair to thank you for sharing your plans going forward. You can continue to count on this delegation's support. We look forward to receiving the summary and further informal conversations intercessionally. And with this Mr. Chair, my delegation also wishes to commend you for your able stewardship this week. We thank all the presenters for their time and useful contribution, all colleagues and delegations for their constructive engagement, and the secretariat and interpreters for the excellent support to our work. Thank you very much.",1
S1M1054,1,10,Brazil,"Thank you. Thank you very much, Chair. It's a challenge to wrap up this very interesting exchange of views. I'll try my best. At first, I'd like to thank you, Mr. Chair, for your able and skillful steering of our work. It is in my view, in our view, that in large part to your diplomatic skills and to the contributions of our panelists. This OEWG has started its work in a very positive manner. We leave this room today with a far better understanding of the nature of the problems we are facing and of the divergences in our views on how to address them. Brazil hopes that this OEWG will agree on recommendations on irresponsible, and threatening behavior in outer space. But these recommendations cannot simply be a rerun of the GG on TCBMs. We believe that we must go beyond that. For Brazil, the recommendations of this group must be conceived as a concrete step towards the long-standing objective of preventing an arms race in outer space, and above all, preventing conflict in outer space. The reason this objective is so important is because conflict in outer space would probably be a one-off event. If such a conflict ever comes to pass, there's a high risk that the outer space environment will be closed off for humankind for a very long time. In this regard, we believe that the Chinese delegation has offered us a phrase that should be taken up as our motto. Space war cannot be won and must never be fought. Brazil has welcomed also the announcement of a unilateral moratorium of direct dissent anti-satellite tests by the U.S. We heard many say this moratorium is not an all-encompassing answer to our problems. And we certainly agree with that assessment. But we believe that if this moratorium were to be reciprocated by all states with capabilities in this field, we would achieve a much improved environment for in terms of mutual trust, while mitigating the threat that such tests present to the peaceful activities of all states in outer space. We have three more sessions to develop the ideas and to bridge the gaps among the different positions that we heard this week. And it won't be an easy task, but we must rise to the challenge. Brazil is determined to do its utmost to help achieving this objective. Thank you Mr. Chairman. See you all in September and let's go to work. Thank you.",4
S2M19,2,1,Uruguay,"Thank you very much for giving me the floor, Chair. I'm going to try and assist you by breaking the ice and asking a stupid question. I apologize for my ignorance but I'd like to ask the very last speaker how you measure the return on investment in satellites. You say that companies want a 50% return but perhaps you can give us more examples to explain this matter to us further. Thank you.",2
S2M111,2,1,Mr. Clark,"My Spanish is not very good at all. So just to that point, so when I made that chart, I just went and looked at the a handful of public companies financial statements so in marsat intel set s e s and their documents talk about wanting to get a fifteen percent return on investment now they want an economic return on investment they fly the satellite they sell services the broadcast communications and they they monetize it by uh... selling services When you're a space faring, when you're a nation making that decision, you may not want to have an economic return on investment, but there is some value you hope to get from your spacecraft. So in the U.S., I'll say, I'll use GPS as an example. The United States government doesn't exact any monetary return. No one pays for GPS, but the U.S. government believes that GPS, the benefits to our nation are in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars per year of economic benefit. Somewhere like Uruguay, you may decide, oh, we want to do Earth imaging satellites to look at deforestation or remote or farm management in remote locations of your country. And you might not get financial benefit from a subscription to the images you made from your spacecraft. But if you better managed it, your the use of your resources, your physical resources, you might derive benefit from it. And so I think each nation goes through that process when they're thinking about what satellites they want to build and for what purpose. And what I wanted to give you guys a sense of is if you were doing that as a business, you would have to extract economic value. But the decision makers in your nations, when they're deciding they were going to build some type of satellite, they're looking for some benefit from it. And it's just useful to think about if Uruguay built a satellite tomorrow and put it in geo, the expectation is it would generate $2 every second for 15 years of value. That's the calculus every organization that builds a satellite goes through. Thank you.",2
S2M113,2,1,United Kingdom,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you to all the panelists for those really excellent and thought-provoking presentations. We've heard quite a lot about the importance of understanding intent in the context of our discussions on... on threats to space systems, but also the difficulty of determining intent in the space environment. And we've also been introduced to other terms, including sort of unintentional threats and negligence. And I just wonder if the panelists have any further advice for us in how we might distinguish between those terms and also how we might overcome the uncertainty that's inherent in those, in those difficulties. for the purposes of our discussions today. Thank you.",2
S2M122,2,1,Australia,Thank you Chair and thank you very much to the panellists for the enriching presentations. My delegation... has listened with interest and a number of the presenters have acknowledged that behaviour and intent are critical considerations when considering threats and we agree that these are very important elements but we note intent is very difficult to prove. So our question is what are some measures including potential norms that could address some of these challenges?,2
S2M130,2,1,Germany,"Mr. Chair, we have a question to Professor Wang on the interplay of negligence and intent. Professor Wang, you made a very strong case for making intent a starting point of our considerations. There is intent regarding acts, but there's also intent regarding omissions. And I think that's a very good point. I would ask you, can you outline maybe in a bit more detail where would you see thresholds for intent regarding emissions, for instance, emissions of applying the rules of the road in space? Thank you.",3
S2M134,2,1,France,"Thank you very much, Chair, and thank you very much to the panelists for their presentations. My question is particularly for the representative of Exxon Eliminate, but also for the whole panel. For some states and some actors, there are different levels of perception of the threat. Would it be possible to be given some examples or to further elaborate on this question of different thresholds of threat? Certain actions or certain emissions can be perceived as threats or not by some actors. Do you have some examples or different elements for this difference to give us?",2
S2M136,2,1,Mr. Clark,"I ask for no tough questions, so thank you for that. I guess what I would say is we see behaviors on orbit all the time where – our customers, the owner operators, so let's say NMARSAT, IntelSAT, et cetera, have spacecraft operating closer to them than they would like. And there are a whole host of reasons, I think. And I think if you use Dr. Suzuki's presentation, he lays out the different types of threats. The most common threat are unintentional, right? Radio frequency interference. We get too close to each other, and our broadcast signal affects your broadcast signal, and we've gotta de-conflict that. And so there's a lot of infrastructure in the ITU built around protecting against that. I think the next most common threat that people worry about, again, it's unintentional, it's collision. worried about with debris objects but also co-locating active spacecraft occasionally get too close to each other. That's especially true in low earth orbit. So I think those are the most common examples that you run into. Proximity, that's planned or unplanned to get too close and radio frequency interference. But this really isn't about unintentional although this is the most common so I would say. Maybe more to your point, do we see intentional activity like that? Do we see a spacecraft getting intentionally too close or to cause jamming or to cause collision? No. In practice, we do not. The satellites that I showed you that move back and forth, for example, all maintain safe physical distance of not seeing. But it can be done. In fact, the example I used with the chair, a commercial company did rendezvous, they went in and physically touched it. So there's capability there. And there are numerous examples. And I think the best way to think about it, again, I love Dr. Suzuki's charts, just look at the threats that he listed and think about how they would affect any one or two of your spacecraft and how uncomfortable any of those might make your operators, your delegations operators, and you can build backwards some rules that would say, look, if you didn't break these lines, we would be okay. It wouldn't business it wouldn't affect our ability to deliver services. But from an example standpoint, thousands a day of satellites getting very close to each other, dozens a day of them interfering with electronics.",2
S2M138,2,1,Austria,"For giving me the floor, I just have two questions. I mean, the first one is for Mr. Black. We understood from your presentation or from one special slide in this presentation that deterrent strategies do not work because people have no understanding of the steps or even possible consequences of escalation. What do you see or what would you recommend as concrete measures to increase this understanding, to make intent also better understood and also if we have kind of this understanding how to make it more sustainable so that it actually stays and sticks with all the actors. A second question is directed to Mr. Clark. We take from your presentation that you probably also have a lot of contact with commercial actors so we would be interested to protect their money printing machines and also the space they operate in. Thank you.",2
S2M142,2,1,Mr. Clark,"Thank you for the question. I think in the space industry there's two kinds of individuals. There's the very eccentric, very famous leaders like Elon Musk. Then there's the more pragmatic folks like me. And we're pretty simple to understand. And so my colleagues in the commercial satellite industry are pretty straightforward about what they worry about. The first is radio frequency interference. If they have radio frequency interference, the money printer stops immediately and it doesn't turn on until the frequency interference is corrected. And so anything that causes that, whether it's ground based or space based, they want rules that help protect them from that. And they have a bunch of... what do I call them, committees like this, where they work together to try to prevent doing it to each other. I think the second thing that they worry about is the risk of collision, whether it's with debris or with each other. Again, so. Radio frequency interference is short term, you stop printing money for a short amount of time. If you get collided with, you stop printing money with that printer forever. But it's a very much lower risk, but they also deal with that. And those are the two things that our business focuses on for them. I think the last thing that they focus on is sort of the long-term viability of their business, right? So they'll have multiple spacecraft and they'll want them all to be able to operate safely. And they wanna build a business plan that goes out into the future of some amount of time. And so how do you apply those rules that they'll sort of be able to continuously operate safely and free of jamming? And so they put together rules about how they fly within proximity to each other. If they're going to be close, they're very specific about the way in which they shape the little circles that they fly in so they don't touch each other. And there's a ton of stuff. I don't have it in front of me, but... the secure well foundation which is represented somewhere in the audience they have written a handbook for new space actors it has a lot of interesting uh... guidance for a new player in space how you should fly spacecraft what are some of the court of the sort of currently acceptable best practices and i think that's a useful document and i would say every commercial company tries to adhere to to that and and where they don't i would say the larger commercial operators wish that we would help others do that better  if that makes sense.",2
S2M22,2,2,Unidir,"Thank you, Chair. Mr. Chair X-17 Distinguished Delegates. At the request of the chair of this open-ended working group, Unidos admitted a working paper titled Threats to the Security of Space Activities insistence. My name is Al Muenas Cara de Ortega and I lead research on space security masses at Unity. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to present this working paper here today on behalf of Unity. The objective of this paper is to provide context on the matter of threats to space security and to highlight issues that have been most commonly identified as current and all future threats to space security, so as to support this group's mandate to consider current and future threats by states to space systems and actions, activities and emissions that could be considered irresponsible, as outlined in Section 5B of UNGA Resolution 76. T31. Before delving on the specific issues of threats are Unidis working paper seeks to provide some important context. Firstly, it provides context on definitions. Resolution 76231 emphasises in its text that there is a need to maintain outer space as a peaceful, safe, stable, secure and sustainable environment for the benefit of all. Language such as this is common in multilateral discussions on the use of space. And has prompted the establishment of two distinct areas, space security on the one hand and space safety on the other, both of which aim to ensure that the space domain is kept peaceful and sustainable. Regarding space safety, space safety is a term that is used generally to refer to measures aimed at preventing accidental or unintentional hazards to space systems. This hazards can be natural, such as geomagnetic storms or. Hazards that stem from human made objects, such as the accidental malfunctioning of a satellite. These natural or unintentional hazards are considered risks as opposed to threats, and these issues of space safety are generally understood to be part of the browser topic of the peaceful uses of that space, which are generally discussed at copious. Space security, on the on the other hand, is a term generally used to refer to measures designed to prevent deliberate harms to a space system, including its component parts. From intended or intentional threats undertaken by another actor. Space Security is also concerned with the relationship between space objects and the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as the work of states to prevent an arms race in out space. Security and safety can often intersect and overlap and in this sense safety and security are two sides of one same coin. That coin being space sustainability which is stakeholders ability to continue to be able to use space for the benefit of all. Secondly, this working paper also provides context on what space systems are, in order to highlight that space systems are generally understood to have several components. 1st we have space based components which can be satellite or space launched vehicles, but we also have and. This was also explained this morning by one of the panellists. We have ground based elements such as satellite dishes and receiving stations. We have the data LinkedIn between and. Threats to to space systems can be directed at any of these components and can originate from the ground or from space. Unity's working paper then moves on to provide an overview of threats commonly highlighted by by states. It should be underscored that threat perception involves a certain degree of subjectivity and different actors and stakeholders might have different views of what threats are more important as different actors and stakeholders also have different interests when it comes to space systems. It should also be noted that the perception of threats to the security space activities. And to the security of space systems themselves can change as space systems evolve through technological change. Therefore, our working paper and my presentation here today does not aim to be exhaustive in scope. Rather, we seek to draw attention to the many points of convergence that exists among states relating to the issue threats. Throughout the examination of proposals, instruments, admissions to processes and statements in different fora, we have assessed and that although states do have different ideas of how to achieve space security, they share many common concerns on what constitutive threat to space security and we have highlighted six of these threats or concerns in our working paper. Firstly, there is the weaponization of space. The placement or deployment of weapons in outer space, or the weaponization of space that it is often called, is an important concern which many states have been discussing for years. It should be noted that the word or the concept, weaponization, is a term that is distinct from militarization. The lassie generally refers to the proliferation of any military activity, whether it's peaceful or aggressive. Whether weaponization, however, refers to the proliferation specifically of weapons, although it should also be pointed out that there is no universally accepted definition for this term, the term weapons or space weapons. There is so so this this issue of of space weapons not being not being universally accepted is what has caused the tongue weaponization to also not be universally accepted. So I will be using the term counter space technologies instead to sort of avoid confusion. This term, counter space technologies, is a term that has been favoured by by many states instead of space weapons. Cancer space technologies can be used against any component of a space system, as I expressed before and as was expressed this morning. And this can be done from space or from the Earth, thus creating four different threat vexes. That being firstly, Earth to space, secondly, space to space, thirdly, space to Earth and fourthly, Earth to Earth. And while there is no universal classification of the different types of technologies, we saw one such classification this morning. Therefore, I will be brief. These types of technologies can be grouped into. The following two main categories. Firstly, we have kinetic, physical or heart skill technologies, which are essentially technologies that attempt to strike an object directly or to detonate a warhead near a satellite or ground station. They can be used again from the ground or they can also be called orbital. Then we also have non kinetic or soft kill technologies. These technologies can also be subdivided into different groups. Firstly non kinetic physical which would be technologies that have physical effects on satellites or ground systems without making physical contact. So examples of these are lasers or high-powered microwaves or electromagnetic politics for example. Blind or dazzle or even cause permanent damage to electrical circuits of a satellite. A second group would be electronic or electromagnetic technologies, which target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space system can transmit and receive data. These examples of these technologies can be jamming or spoofing technologies. 1/3 subgroup would be cyber and these technologies can target the data itself. And the systems that use transmit and control the flow of that data. Then, moving on from the concern about the weaponization of outer space, a second concern, but that states have frequently, and particularly in recent years, spoken about, is the intentional creation of space debris. Deliberate creation of debris is considered particularly alarming due to its preventable nature, and while some have expressed that space debris concerns have already been addressed by Copios Space agreement guidelines, for example, or the long term sustainability guidelines, most acknowledge that this is an issue of concern that also threatens space security. Debris can remain in orbit for a very long time. And it can therefore accumulate. Acidic acid is produced, further increasing the risk of collision with other satellites. The risk exists always, irrespective of the precision with which an ASAP is able to target a specific satellite. Concern over space debris has recently LED a few states to commit to not just direct descent kinetic Asax. 1/3 concern is harmful interference. States have also expressed concerns about the potential use of non kinetic technologies that could intentionally interfere with the regular operations of a satellite systems which could have dangerous effects on the services that these satellite systems provide. This threat has been highlighted as particularly dangerous due to the difficult task of attributing these attacks, activities that hint at the possibility of a harmful interference such as non consensual approaches that we heard about this morning. Have also raised concern among certain states is threats to space security. An additional and different concern is the concern posed by door use and dual purpose objects. This is something that we also heard about this this morning. Generally these objects are understood T4 under the umbrella term of dual use space objects, but they can be actually subdivided into two groups. Firstly there are those objects that I would call actual dual use objects which can have military as well as civilian or commercial functions, for example DNSS. And then we have dual purpose objects which are designed to fulfil a benign objective such as debris removal or on orbit servicing. But could potentially be repurposed in order to harm another satellite. So it should be pointed out that these door use and door pubs objects in themselves are perhaps not a threat to space security as they are not intended for aggressive use. But they, and often in the case of for example, of dual purpose objects, they are often not intended for any military function at all. The threat perception regarding these objects stems from the lack of understanding of how these objects are used rather than the objects themselves. States have called for increased transparency and communication regarding. The use to diffuse tensions without hampering technological innovation. A different concern, also raised by states, is the lack of common understanding transparency on communication among different actors and stakeholders regarding space security, which can heighten tensions among actors in a dangerous way. States have called for increased emphasis on communication of space security doctrines and policies, notifications of manoeuvres and close approaches, and transparency regarding space capabilities. Moreover, the lack of common understanding over the interpretation of key concepts. Laws and regulations, as also be, has also been raised as an issue that should be addressed. Lastly, the last concern that we highlight in our working paper is reverberating effects. So beyond specific threats, states have expressed an underlying concern with these reverberating effects, particularly with regards to secondary damage and the human impact caused by disruption to or the destruction of critical infrastructure capabilities and the space environment. To conclude, I'd like to say that Indiscernible background paper highlights that despite deferring and sometimes diverging interests of stakeholders in space, there are also many common concerns regarding what constitutes a threat to space security, particularly among states. The existence of such convergence of use should be explored as it provides the international community with the opportunity to reach common understanding on how best to mitigate these threats in order to successfully achieve space security. It should also be noted, however, that the identification of threats to space systems is not a static or straightforward task. Rather, it is dynamic and a dynamic endeavour requiring continuous attention and that cannot be solved through a single process or proposal. As we also heard this morning during the during the panel sessions. Therefore, Unity stands ready to support this OWG and its work to consider threats to space systems during this week and beyond. Thank you very much for your attention.",0
S2M24,2,2,Cambodia,"So much, Mr. Chair, I have the honor to deliver my statement. On behalf of the Member State of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We would like to commend you, Mr. Chair, and the Secretariat, for the excellent work in convening the second sessions of the OEWG and to thank the panelists for lending the expertise this week. During the first substantive session of OE WG, ASEAN Member State noted that the world has witnessed much change since the dawn of space age about 6 decades ago. The international community has benefited mostly from the enhancement in telecommunications and financial sectors that have been made possible by the space based technology. Mr. Chair at the 55th Asian Ministry Meeting last month in Phnom Penh, ASEAN Foreign Minister noted this ongoing multilateral discussions on emerging issues involving international peace and security. Besides just the outer space. In their joint communique issue, the ASEAN Foreign Minister reiterated that access to outer space is an inlineable right of all States and that the use of outer space should be exclusively be for peaceful purposes only and for the collective benefit of humanity. Stressing that activities in outer space should not remain the exclusive preserve of a small group of states, we reiterate our call on all Member States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to contribute actively to the goal of preventing and embrace in outer space as an essential condition for promoting international cooperation and exploration and using outer space for peaceful purposes and the maintenance of international peace and security. In this regard, we welcome this opportunity for Member States to exchange use on current and future threats by state to space system and actions. Activities and omissions that could be considered irresponsible. Adaptively, with increased access to outer space comes greater responsibility for the entire UN membership. This further underscores the need for shared understanding and the acceptance of norms developed through multilateral engagement. These discussions this week are essential in this regard. We know the submissions by delegations and institutions that contribute to these discussions, including the working paper #12 submitted by the Philippines. We reiterate that all activities in outer space must be conducted in accordance with international law and the principle of non appropriation of outer space. We reiterate our city's concern regarding the threats to international peace security by the possible weaponization of the space or turning out the space into a domain for warfare and armed conflicts and a work commitment to the work of relevant multilateral bodies such as Committee on Peaceful Use of Outer Space and UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, which serve as. An important platform to promote international cooperation on the peaceful use of outer space. We reaffirm the vital importance of preventing arm rays in outer space and weaponization, the urgent need for commencement of substantive negotiation in the Conference on Disarmament on the legally binding and multilaterally verifiable instrument or prevention of an embrace in outer space, including the prohibition and placement of outer space. Including the prohibition of placement of weapons in outer space and prohibition of threat or use of force against outer space objects. The need for a universal, comprehensive and non discriminatory modular approach toward the issue of missiles in all aspects negotiated materially within the UN, noting that any initiatives on this subject should take into account security concerns of all States and their inherent right to peaceful uses of space technologies. Finally, we reiterate our call for continued action in mitigating the effect of space debris through the urban material fora and we stand ready to engage with all parties in moving this agenda forward. Our discussion this week will must affirm the need to ensure that outer space is, both in principle and practice, a truly global Commons to which Allstate can avail themselves. Mr. Chair, you can count on the support of the ACM Member State as you lead us forward on this work. I thank you so much.",4
S2M26,2,2,European Union,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good afternoon, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to speak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate countries N Macedonia and Albania and the potential candidate country Bosnia and Herzegovina aligns itself with this declaration. We would like to congratulate you and your team for your excellent work in steering the work of this open-ended working group during its first substantial session held in May. We also appreciate your efforts in preparing the chair summary of that meeting and look forward to further substantive discussions this week. The second session of the OEWG convinced during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is causing a tragic loss of life and immense human suffering. Russia's unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the UN Charter. And undermines international peace and security. The international community will hold Russia accountable for its actions. EU and its member states expressed full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. The EU remains strongly committed to the fight against impunity for atrocities. Mr. Chair, irresponsible behaviors can be threatening and may lead to escalation, including through misunderstanding, misinterpretation or miscalculation. Therefore, threats and irresponsible behavior in space could have grave consequences for the security and safety of people and goods, and impact present and future generations. Given the dual use nature of many space systems, the EU and its Member States believe that an approach based on behaviors. Supported by relevant monitoring capabilities is the most pragmatic and immediate way forward to improve space security today, as it will help to reduce the risk of misunderstanding, misinterpretation and miscalculation and therefore decrease the risk of conflicts and escalation in outer space. We also stress that this does not exclude the possibility of a legally binding instrument in the future. The second session of the OWG dedicated to threats and threatening behaviors in outer space is thus a unique opportunity for all states to share their concerns and priorities and to present to other states their views of which behaviors they consider irresponsible or threatening. It is an opportunity to engage in a dialogue and to collectively reflect on each other's securities concerned. We believe that this dialogue and exchange could act as a confidence building measure. Mr. Chair, as the space environment is becoming increasingly contested, congested and competitive, the number of risks and threats to space objects, system and services is rising significantly and merits our full attention. The destruction of space objects, systems and infrastructure, as well as any forced interruption of the services they provide, significantly impacts our societies, which are increasingly dependent upon them. Threatening and irresponsible behaviors can have a significant impact on civilians leading to partial or complete service outage. They can result in reversible or irreversible damages to space systems. And in some cases generate space debris, jeopardizing the orbits of vital interest today and in the future. The rapid technical, economic and political development of the space sector contributes to new and emergent threats, while the inherent dual use nature of many space applications and systems poses challenges when it comes to protecting space assets, identifying threats and interpreting an actor's intentions. The number of threats to space systems is increasing. The persistent development and testing of a direct asset anti satellite capability demonstrate the states intent to acquire capabilities of targeting and destroying satellites of a potential adversary. The conduct of such tests may lead states to perceive their space assets, including satellites, of crucial importance such as command and control, navigation, or communication satellites. To be at risk. Such activities are dangerous and highly destabilizing. They may lead to the deteriorating confidence between space actors, increase the perception of threats, and could trigger an escalation of violence and potentially could have catastrophic consequences. The testing the testing of Kinetic Destructive Anti Satellite System has long lasting consequences on the space environment through the generation of space debris. Moreover, in orbit, Randeva operations and proximity operations and corresponding technologies that affect another state space system can be perceived as a threat when the intention behind the maneuver it's not properly communicated. Such operation, in particular in the case of rendezvous operations, could be misused for irresponsible or threatening activities such as the orbiting satellites, without consent or destroying them. The omission to inform, notify, or communicate about the proximity operation that affects another state space system is considered an irresponsible behavior. Non kinetic threats to space systems and services such as cyber attacks, jamming and other electromagnetic interferences or Direct Energy weapons should also be considered irresponsible when they jeopardize the security of people, goods and services, whether on Earth or in space. In conclusion, the UN and its member states have submitted a joint contribution detailing our position on what we consider as being irresponsible and threatening behavior. We invite all UN member States and other stakeholders to examine it carefully. The UN, its member states therefore continue to be fully committed to engage actively and constructively in this process. We look forward to the views of other States and to engage with them actively in the discussions. In order to concretely advance space security. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M28,2,2,Russia,"Thank you very much, distinguished Chair. At the outset. I would like to wish you every success in your work at this second session of the open-ended working group. Which was created by GA resolution. 76231. We trust that under your leadership. The OWG will be able to make a contribution into resolving issues to do with preventing an arms race in space. You can trust in the support and cooperation of the Russian delegation. We did want to take the floor on a point of order. And to raise two issues. These are related to keeping to the Rules of Procedure, which we agreed upon at the organizational session of the OEWG in particular. The decision that we are to apply there was a procedure of the UN General Assembly. In this regard, we would like to draw your attention to Rule 71 of the UN General Assembly. This is to do with points of order in meetings. The first sentence of that rule completely clearly states. That during the discussion of any issue. Each representative can take the floor with a point of order. And the issue that they have raised. Will be immediately resolved by the Chair, in line with the Rules of Procedure. Therefore. Chan. We ask to be given the flu on a point of order. At that very moment when the request was made. In this regard. We believe that giving the Russian Federation floor, when it is requested, the floor on a point of order, is something that was necessary. It should have been conducted as soon as that request came in. The second point we would like to raise is with regard. To Rule 78 of the Rules of Procedure of the UN General Assembly. This is to do with statements. In particular, the understanding that none of the representatives. No representative can speak without having been authorized to do so by the chair, and also that the chair can call a speaker to order. If their comments aren't have nothing to do with the issue at hand. The issues that we are discussing here have been very clearly laid out in the agenda of this OEWG. And they are linked. To topics to do with Georgia resolution 76231. In particular. This session. In line with the program of work that you mentioned is to do with discussing challenges and risks and threats when it comes to space objects and space systems, as well as discussing measures. Which should be undertaken. In order to regulate these challenges and threats. The statement from the representative of the European Union, in particular comments related to the special military operation conducted by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, have nothing to do with the topic of this working groups meeting, and they're also not to do with anything on the agenda. Therefore. We would like to call you to strictly act in line where there was a procedure of EU NS General Assembly. And in line with rule 78 and to call to order. A delegation, in particular the delegation of the European Union. We would also like for you to ask them. To closely stick to the issues that are to be discussed at this EWG. Namely, issues that are related to risks and threats when it comes to space, objects and systems. Moreover, we would like to ask you, distinguished Chair, to also closely keep to the Rules of Procedure of the UN General Assembly in particular. Rule 71 with regard to points of order during meetings and to give the floor to delegations who have asked for the floor on a point of order at the time. They have requested when their request has come in. As I said, thank you.",2
S2M210,2,2,Philippines,"Since this is the first time for my delegation to take the floor, we wish to join others in expressing our profound condolences to the distinguished delegation of the United Kingdom on the passing of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the 2nd. Please allow us also to thank you, Mr. Chair and the Secretariat for the excellent arrangements for this week's session. We also thank all the panelists for lending their expertise. This morning the Philippines aligns itself with a statement delivered. Excellency, the Ambassador of Cambodia on behalf of the ASEAN, The mandate of this session is to consider current and future threats by states to space systems and actions, activities and omissions that could be considered irresponsible. This is a crucial component of our work to elaborate norms of responsible behavior in outer space with a view to preserving outer space security. My delegation takes the floor with the delegation of Germany in order to present our joint analysis of security risks. Threats and Irresponsible Behavior in Outer Space. We have put our views on record through Working Paper #17, which has been circulated among delegations, is and is now available on the, You know, the Web site. A working paper begins with the characterization of security risks and threats. While these two concepts overlap, they are distinct. Security risks are conditions and actions that may lead to an increased likelihood of misunderstandings and inadvertent escalation. Security threats, on the other hand, are the acute harmful effects of deliberate actions. I will provide an overview of our understanding of security risks and security threats, while my German colleague will classify the broad spectrum of counter space activities and characterize what we view as irresponsible behaviors. Let me turn to examples for security risks. First, we see risk in insufficient understanding of states about the purpose and use of certain space assets and technologies. By another state, this risks come in three aspects. The dual use nature of most space objects could cause misperceptions and misunderstandings. Further, while the launch position and movement of a space asset can be observed remotely by other states, certain components of a satellite which determine its possible applications and mission are much harder or even impossible to observe remotely. Third, insufficient registration practice. And deviations from typical patterns of behavior are likely to create misunderstanding. 2nd, we see risk in insufficient understanding of mutual threat perceptions. We stress that the lack of understanding of the kind of behaviors that another state deems threatening or escalatory could lead to an increased risk of miscalculation. Third, lack of channels of communication, making it difficult to clarify and deconflict operations in space. 4th, we see risk in the lack of transparency on national space programs. And finally, we see risk in the absence of clear and internationally understood standards and norms of behavior. Such standards make it possible to distinguish between innocuous patterns of behavior and potentially worrying deviations from the norm. On the other hand, we identify the following mostly intentional behavior as security threats. First, threats to the safe operation of space assets and to the long term sustainability of the outer space, such as any action that could lead to the destruction of or irreversible damage to a satellite or loss of the ability of an operator to control a satellite. This includes destructive testing of direct ascent anti satellite satellite missiles. 2nd, Threats to the provision of critical space based services to the public such as positioning, navigation and timing or satellite communication. Impairment or disruption of these services could surpass a critical threshold and therefore lead to loss of life or damage to property. Finally, threats to the use of space systems and services for national security, impairment or disruption of command and control systems and space systems used for early warning. Positioning, navigation and timing, or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Lead to unwanted escalation, Mr. Chair. These risks and threats pose challenges to the full utilization of outer space by all states, particularly developing countries, in pursuing their Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, they could impair the following.",0
S2M212,2,2,Germany,"Yeah, Mr. Chair, in our in our working paper together with the Philippines, we then classify the broad spectrum of counter space activities and this classification reflects more or less what we had this morning by the panelists. That are that the threats can be categorized into kinetic direct ascent anti satellite missiles, Co orbital kinetic anti satellite capabilities. And this is an aspect which we believe very important for the further work of this group, because here you'll use concerns are particularly prominent as rendezvous and close proximity operations are on the one hand essential for maintenance, repair and fuelling of spacecraft, but they can also be used in the various ways. To cause harm on spacecrafts of other nations and similar arguments of dual use can be made for satellites with robotic arms that can be used for active debris removal but also to harm other satellites. The third category are Direct Energy capability, directed energy capabilities, that is, to lose use of lasers or high-powered microwaves which can cause reversible or irreversible damage on a satellite. Radio frequency capabilities for jamming and spoofing. As well as cyber intrusion and building on this analysis of threats and security risks as well as capabilities on counter space activities. We then move on in our paper to describe a number of behaviors which we consider irresponsible. And let me say at this point in time that we offer these for discussion. We believe there's a need to further analyze them. But this is, in a way what we, from our analysis, believe to be irresponsible behaviors. At this present state of analysis, first is in our view, the destructive testing or actual use of. Directors and anti satellite missiles against another state's space system. Another behavior which we identify as approaching or following shadowing an active satellite without prior information and coordination and holding at risk with a Co orbital anti satellite or dual use capability. And then we identify behaviors related to ondevu and proximity operations. And we believe this is a very important issue, but also one which requires further analysis. We do hope that we can agree on a behavior regarding rendezvous operations, that is operations where one spacecraft actually makes physical contact with another spacecraft. And here we would say that conducting rendezvous operations with active satellites of another state. Without, without prior consultation or consent, as irresponsible. And then we look at proximity operations. Where we, in our view, need to balance the free use of space and also the freedom of maneuver in space. With the spirit of due regard and respect for the interests of other space States and their spacecraft, and here we would say the following, and in a way, we identify thereby 33 aspects of proximity operations which, in our view, can be problematic. And therefore we considered irresponsible behaviors. We would say that conducting proximity operations that impair the safe operation of another space asset or during an orbital maneuver of the approach satellite without consultation. Or after the affected state has requested consultations or cessation of the maneuver, that such a behavior is responsible. And then we identify a number of other behaviours which I just want to flag briefly that is insufficient. Implementation of The Hague Code of Conduct by not issuing PRE launch. Notification or releasing objects such as sub satellites or ejecting projectile like fragments in the vicinity of another satellite or interfering by cyber electromagnetic means with the senses or command and control of the space system leading to impairment or even loss of operational control. Cyber and electromagnetic interference. Into critical services for civilian users such as P&T services or interfering with space enabled early boarding and military command and control. Or, for instance, interfering with systems used for space situational awareness or intelligence, race and reconnaissance with the intent to conceal harmful activity in space, or preparations for escalation and conflict. So in conclusion, Mr. Chair. From this analysis, we take that it is in the very nature of the security risks and threats that we identified. That responsible behaviors offer pragmatic and effective way to address them. Thank you.",0
S2M214,2,2,Japan,"Thank you very much for giving me the flow and also kind your address to me from my health. So, Mr. Chair and the distinguished colleagues at the outset allow me also to extend my heartfelt condolences to the UK delegations on the passing away of the Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth second. I would also like to express our sincere appreciation to you, Mr. Chair, for the smooth launch of this OWG, and reassure you of the full support from my delegation. Japan is strongly committed to maintaining outer space as a peaceful, safe, stable, secure and sustainable environment and advancing discussions on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of. Responsible behaviors. Based upon UN generous resolutions, 75 slash 36 and 76 slash 231 as a practical way forward in advancing the prevention of an arms race in outer space. In order to provide some basis for the second session of this OWG, let me share Japans key takeaways from the previous session as well as views regarding the agenda for this session. First of all, the peaceful use of outer space and protecting the space environment are of critical importance for all, including future generations. At the last meeting, many states shared the recognition of the increasing reliance on space for our daily lives and security. From this perspective, Japan strongly believes that states should refrain from the deliberate destruction of space objects that creates negative impact on the space environment, especially through debris, which could hamper access to and use of outer space for a long time. In this context, I have the pleasure to announce that Japan commits not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti satellite missile testing and joins the US commitment announced in April. Secondly, properly addressing the dual use nature of space assets is important in discussions of space security. As it was amply highlighted in the first session, space is a domain where even innovative technologies developed with benign intention may, if used inappropriately, pose a serious threat to other others due to their dual use nature. For example, it is possible to cause extensive damage simply by hitting an object with other object. This dual nature also possesses opposes difficult challenges for identifying space threats if we focus solely on capabilities of space assets. Rather, it is more practical to establish a common understanding on patterns of behaviors. Such an understanding can serve as the basis for identifying potentially threatening activities. The saddle point I would like to make is that the first session so many states share the applicability of relevant international law, notably the Outer Space Treaty. These countries also emphasized the importance of further clarifying times referred to in the treaty, such as harmful interference. When counseling current and future threats while we understand the significance and utility of focusing on the capability. That can bring about a space threat. What matters more is the way such capabilities are used. Japan suggests focusing on the consequences, impacts, or effects caused by behaviors rather than specific capabilities of a certain asset. This approach would enable us to explore further innovation in such areas as on orbit services. Moreover. Rules to regulate specific capabilities may be quickly invalidated and outdated by the emergence of new technologies. In this context, who are not prejudging the outcome of this session? Japan considers that a starting of our discussion of defining the notion of threat should be behaviors that cause physical damage or grave harmful consequences, as it is the most obvious case. Especially when conducted against security related space systems such as the nuclear command, control and communication. Re warning systems, national technical means of verification, what systems necessary for sustaining the everyday lives of citizens? Mr. Chair, as all states are reliant on space, we believe that the inclusive process of the OEWG is well suited for deepening and fostering comma understandings on reducing space threats and look forward to further discussions. Thank you very much for your kind attention.",0
S2M216,2,2,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The 10th Delegation congratulates you on presiding over the second session of the OEWG and will continue actively support your work together with other delegations. We hope that under your professional leadership. All parties. Will focus on the goal of preventing the norms raising of the space through chromatic pragmatic discussion on the basis of the first session of spiritual equality, mutual respect and lay a good foundation, more solid foundation for follow up work of the OEWG. With regard to the Chair's summary distributed by you after the first session in China and some other countries are put forward constructive feedback after careful study. Hoping to help reflect the views put forward by all parties in the first session in a more comprehensive, objective and balanced way and help you, Mr. Chairman, put forward push forward the next step on this basis. Mr. Chairman, I listen carefully to the panel's discussion Just now. We also listened carefully to the Unity's presentation. We will conduct a careful study of the presentation. The presentations of bandits, including the ideas and views shared by the Chinese panelists. Are very enlightening. China believes that before discussing specific issues, we should first make clear what aspects of the threat of outer space include and whether the goal of this working group is to treat the symptoms or cure the root causes. Chinese people say it is better to remedy the root causes rather than just symptoms, but you have noticed that the topic of this session mainly focuses on specific scenarios related to physical threats to outer space security. Frankly speaking, these specific scenarios are all symptoms of the problem. The root causes of problem lie in the policies, doctrines, and strategies of individual space power trying to dominate outer space and series of actual combat oriented outer space armament, development plans, military buildup, and military activities which can be characterized as policy threats or doctrinal threats. I said in first session that from the historical practical point of view, the root cause of the risk to of an arms race in outer space lies in the superpowers attempt to dominate outer space. Although the Cold War has ended for 30 years, the practice of the individual countries sticking to code or mentality unilaterally, seeking strategic advantage in outer space, has not stopped on the country. Its plans and actions related to outer space operations are constantly increasing. According to the new space policy document recently released by the Superpower, the document openly points space as a priority domain of national military power and seeks A durable strategic advantage in outer space. To enhance deterrence in outer space domain, its space force is required to conduct operations in, from and to space. Libas mentioned outer space security policies and measures are the continuation of this country's long standing strategy of dominance, dominance in outer space and their law. They are also the most prominent factor of the rising risk of weaponization and arms race in outer space, posing A fundamental and lasting threat to outer space peace and security. Obviously this is an issue that we need to discuss in depth at present in social to be a priority topic in this working group. If we put aside this fundamental threat, only discuss this so-called the physical threat of the so-called specific scenarios and on this basis form. A so-called code of conduct for responsible outer space behavior. Which may eventually lead to a situation of 1. Superpower dominates outer space and other countries behave. Further, this will help achieve the goal of preventing naturals anonymously in outer space and maintain lasting peace and security in outer space. Deserves our in depth consideration, Mr. Chairman. China has noted that many countries stand for a comprehensive analysis in discussing the threat of outer space, including specific scenarios such as a ground to space, space to space, space to ground and ground to ground. Some experts in the morning. They also mentioned a comprehensive perspective and holistic approach this morning in the discussion. China in principle agrees to this idea and supports A comprehensive discussion of all other space threats including policies, threads and stands for a coordinated study and comprehensive measures to deal with outer space threats as to avoid taking stopgap measures. Regard, Mr. Chairman, regarding the initiative to ban destructive direct descent, ascent anti sub satellite missile testing. Some countries have also expressed their views on this question at the first session. China welcomes all arms control initiatives that are truly conducive to achieving the goal of preventing arms race in outer space, but opposes any attempt to expand unilateral military superiority under the pretext of arms control. This initiative does not mention the research and development, production, deployment and use of such weapons, let alone other activities that threaten or disrupt the normal operation of satellites, which is not enough to address various issues in outer space. As a matter of fact, the draft Outer Space 3 DBWT jointly submitted and updated by China and Russia to the CD, both in contents and implications, is much broader than the relevant above mentioned initiative. By prohibiting the deployment of weapons in outer space and the use of or threats of use of force against outer space. Objects PPW draft restrict the proliferation and use of all empty subject weapons, whether they come from land, sea space or outer space, thus solving the problem of empty set weapon testing that all parties are concerned about in the package. I would like to emphasize that all kinds of scenario threats discussed in this meeting are within the scope of the PPWT. If all countries undertake not to place weapons in outer space and not to use a threatened to use force against outer space objects, these threats will naturally cease to exist. China welcomes all parties continued support for the negotiation and conclusion of another space arms control treaty on the basis of PPWT and expect this group to actively consider making comprehensive recommendations or eliminating a host of threats to outer space, including policy threats to outer space. : In the next. Discussions in the next few days, my team. Will carefully and actively, according to your plan, take part actively in the specific discussions under various items, Mr. Chairman, in April this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward global security initiative. Advocated common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable global security concept and call on all countries to abandon the Cold War mentality. Oppose unilateralism and persist in resolving differences that abuse peacefully between countries through dialogue and consultation. The Global Security Initiative is of great guidance value to solving the security issues in outer space. China stands ready to work with all parties to actively implement the global initiative, make joint efforts to prevent enormous rates in outer space and weaponization of outer space, actively promote the negotiation of a outer space arms control legal instrument and fundamentally safeguard the lasting peace and security in outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",4
S2M218,2,2,United Kingdom,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. the United Kingdom is pleased to participate in this second meeting of the open-ended working group and is looking forward to a rich and constructive set of discussions this week. Thank you for arranging once again such an excellent lineup of experts and for the way you have structured your agenda this week. Let me also thank you and all speakers and delegations who have expressed their condolences on the passing of Her Late Majesty the Queen. The many kind words we have received from friends right across the world have been a great source of comfort at a very sad time for my country. Mr. Chair, we have reached a crucial stage in our journey begun in December 2020 when the General Assembly, through Resolution 75 slash 36, asked States to consider existing and potential threats and security risks to outer space systems, including those arising from actions, activities or systems in outer space or on Earth. Along this process, the United Kingdom has consulted widely with governments and stakeholders around the world, both to raise awareness and to inform our own thinking on space security and threats to space systems. Our starting point is that the prosperity, development and security of all nations rely on space systems. They are critical to healthcare, transportation, communications, energy grids, financial systems and international trade. They underpin humanitarian responses to climate conflict or natural disasters and are increasingly critical to national security and defence. Disruption to or loss of, service damage or destruction Damage to or destruction of space systems.  Could have far reaching or even catastrophic effects, including serious risks to civilians, to national and regional security and to strategic stability. The task you have set us this week is to examine how such threats to international peace and security can result from the activities, actions and omissions of one state to another. In this context, our work, which is a vital contribution to the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space in the UN First Committee and in the Conference on Disarmament, is and should remain distinct from our work in Vienna to keep the space environment safe, secure and sustainable, though clearly we must strive for coherence across these two tracks. Mr. Chair, to understand how the activities, actions and omissions of states can create threats to space systems and therefore to international peace and security, we need first to acknowledge that international relations are increasingly competitive. Intense competition is taking place in and across the space domain and is intrinsically, intrinsically linked to competition in and across other economic, technological and military spheres, adding further complexity to national and International Security. Space is increasingly congested and contested. The number of spacefaring nations is increasing, with both militaries and civil government governmental agencies interested in capturing the benefits from space activities in terms of driving national prosperity, influence and security. The falling cost of space launch and the development of new space related technologies, products and services offers significant opportunities for the future across all sectors of the global economy. Moreover, space systems are a major part of modern military capabilities. They enable freedom of action, communications, command and control, navigation, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and ballistic missile launch launch warning. However, alongside such benefits come significant risks. Nations are finding ways to bolster their global posture, advance their national agendas, and secure operational and strategic advantage against competitors and potential adversaries through the use of space systems. Competitors and adversaries can exploit the vulnerabilities of space systems by seeking to deny access to space derived services, restrict freedom of operation, threaten satellites, or target civilian and military infrastructure. Hence several states possess or are actively pursuing counter space capabilities and technologies ranging from non kinetic effects and electronic warfare to kinetic attack intended to disrupt and deny others use of space. Mr. Chair, our expert discussions will examine in detail the nature of such capabilities. For now, the UK would like to offer three high level observations. First, counter space capabilities can threaten all segments of space systems, by which we mean the satellites, the ground infrastructure, the data links between them and the end user segment as was set out this morning. Second, some of these counter space capabilities are already placed in space, but many of them are not space based and can operate from Earth. 3rd threatening capabilities do not always have the characteristics of a weapon, hence making traditional arms control approaches harder to apply. It is important that we take into account all these characteristics of counter space capabilities as we discuss threats, threats to space systems, because our solutions will need to find ways to address these in a holistic way if we are to reduce risks to international peace and security and prevent an arms race in outer space. However, it will not be enough to consider the nature of the capabilities and technologies. This is clear in the mandate of our open-ended working group and the tasks and questions you have posed. Our challenge is to consider how the behaviors, activities, actions, and omissions of states that are developing, deploying, testing, or using these capabilities give rise to threats to space systems. Such behaviors, unlike many characteristics of counter space technologies and capabilities, can be observed, verified, and more readily regulated. Moreover, we must also consider the risks of misunderstandings. In the intensely competitive environment that I have described, operators of space systems and assets will naturally be wary about the behaviors of another state where these are not transparent, predictable or well understood. Where intent is misunderstood, the perception of a threat can arise, in turn creating risks of miscalculation, potentially leading to unintended conflict. Mr. Chair, in conclusion, our priority for this session is to ensure a robust understanding of the threat, including the irresponsible state behaviour we see manifest itself in from and through space. We should take a holistic approach to kinetic and non kinetic threats in space and from the Earth against all segments of space systems.In some cases it will be clear that specific behaviors are irresponsible. The destructive testing of direct descent anti satellite missiles is, in the UK's view, one such example. We warmly welcome the US commitment not to conduct such tests and their efforts to build the widest possible support behind a new global norm. In this context, let me also welcome the commitment just made by the distinguished ambassador of Japan. We anticipate that many cases will not be so clear cut, and the question of whether we would wish to characterize a behavior as irresponsible will be a complex 1. Moreover, the space domain presents particular challenges when it comes to verification and attribution. As I have explained, the manner and context in which an activity is conducted will often have a significant bearing on how it is interpreted and on the receiving states reaction. The role of norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors should be to reduce the scope for misinterpretation, to improve understanding, communication, transparency and predictability, and thus to prevent unintended escalation and conflict. The United Kingdom is confident that our discussions in the coming days will provide us with valuable insights and contribute to building common understanding and mutual trust. I thank you.",0
S2M220,2,2,Russia,"Distinguished chair. We would also like to. Share some general comments with regard to the topic at hand. The Russian Federation. Has consistently advocated for maintaining space as a domain for peaceful purposes. And. Where all states are treated on an equal basis. Our principled approach remains unchanged. This is to ensure that this goal can be achieved, which can only be done through developing generally recognized and legally binding principles and norms of international law. They should be comprehensive in nature and should also be aimed at preventing an arms race in space. Each year we see that there are growing risks of space being turned into a battleground. Which only show how relevant this topic is today. We recall our concern over the fact that a number of countries have created sites upon which weapons can be launched into space, and it seems that space has been prepared to be used for military purposes in order to ensure their dominance and superiority. We would like to note. That the major programs that they are conducting to develop systems, weapons systems which are aimed. To which aim to use force or for the use of force in space, from space, or with regard to space? Are all of concern. These have a negative impact on International Security and they may lead to a severe deterioration of the situation. Or even an answer is in space. This would fully undermine the prospect. For reducing or allowing for disarmament as a whole. We would call on that state to end its attempts to ensure that space can be a new arena for competition and for conflict amongst states. We would like to focus. On the use which is very worrying of space technologies. As well as trained trends which have appeared with regards to the events in Ukraine. I'm referring to the fact that the USA and their allies have used components of civilian use in space. As well as civilian infrastructure. In space, including commercial. Commercial components for military purposes. Perhaps our colleagues don't fully realise. That these activities. Are in their essence. Direct participation in armed conflict. Quasi civilian infrastructure. Can be a legitimate. Target for a retaliation strike. As a result of the activities of Western countries. There is great risk to the sustainability of space activities as well as many different socioeconomic activities on Earth. Upon which the prosperity of people depends, in particular developing countries. As a minimum. This provocative use of civilian satellites. Raises questions, in particular with regard to the Outer Space Treaty. This stipulates that it is exclusively to be used for peaceful purposes. This should be roundly condemned by the international community. UN member states should focus on adopting both at national and international levels. Of obligations. Stating. That space, in particular near space orbits. Including in near space orbit and also cosmic celestial bodies. These should not have any type of weapon placed upon them. The use of force or the threat of force with regard to space objects should also be prohibited. And related to their use. We should have an overall prohibition on space weapons. We would like to recall. There are proposals in this regard. Such an approach would involve the following obligations. That space objects not be used. As a measure for striking any target upon Earth. Whether it be in airspace or elsewhere. That they should not create, test or deploy weapons in space. For any goal. Including for anti missile defense. Or for anti satellite purposes. All for the use against targets on Earth or in the air. Or. To eliminate systems which states already possess. They should not create, not test, not deploy and not use. Cosmic space weapons. For anti missile defense. As an anti missile system. An anti satellite system or for the use of any targets on the against any targets on the earth or in the air. They should not destroy. Not damage. Or not undermine the normal functioning? Or change the trajectory of space objects belonging to another state. They should not have any impact. Or impede other states or groups of states. Or. Any NGOs or international organisations? Intergovernmental organisations. Including any legal entities which are still. Which have been registered. Who are placed? Foreign territory under their jurisdiction. Or under their control. In taking part in these activities. Without trustworthy guarantees that space will be kept as a space free from weapons. Or illegally binding treaty preventing an arms race in space. Resolving issues related to the peaceful uses of space and ensuring. The security of space activities. Cannot be something we believe to be promising. Such an instrument. Could have as its basis the joint Russian Chinese draft on a treaty on the prevention of placement of weapons in space, or the use of force, or the threat of force with regard to space objects. At the threshold of the next General Assembly session, we would just like to inform you. That in development of last year's GA resolution. 76231230 rather. 2:30. Future measures to prevent an arms race? And also in line of the report from the Secretary general. Which is a 7780. I would like to say that there is a new draft which should lead to a new substantive stage in our work. To the launch of a group of governmental experts to look at recommendations and proposals with regard. To discussions on a legally binding document to prevent an arms race in space. This should have trustworthy guarantees that weapons will not be placed in space. This is also aimed at preventing the use of force or the threat of force with regard to space objects or using space objects. We believe that after this group of governmental experts will conclude their work. In 2019. After they concluded their work, there was a true need for work in such format and we would call on all states to support our draft resolution and to become co-authors. Chair. We would also like to make some comments with regard to the plan of work for the second session that's been put forward. We believe that discussing threats. Within the owg. Should be done. In a way, that's closely linked to the key task of preventing an arms race in space. We see classifying. Risks threats. And dividing them into vectors of use of force. Or threats of the use of force. Is in fact very artificial. And highly theoretical. As we've already said, there are a number of challenges and threats which might not fall under that schema. And might be comprehensive. For example, there could be threats and risks which we could place in several different categories. Which were laid out in the preliminary program of work of the second session. We would like to call on the participants in this open-ended working group to not. Focus on issues which are focused upon by the 1st Committee of the General Assembly. In particular, the regulation of space activities. We draw your attention to the fact that the lion's share. Of the relevant GA resolution 76231. Including various issues to do with ensuring security of space operations. Is already the subject for discussion of corpus. And at the OEWG, ignoring corpuses remit in this area is simply unacceptable. This is because it might undermine the key role of that committee in discussing the space agenda. This important issue. Will be subject to a separate statement from us during our meeting. With regard to developing any transparency or confidence building measures, when it comes to space activities, which? That could be seen as rules of conduct. We believe that they should be aimed. At ensuring a full prohibition on placing weapons in space. The use of force. Or making a threat of force with regard to space objects or using space objects. They may. Supplement. To this, but they should not undermine, if they should not undermine, effective some mechanisms with regard effective agreements with regard to space preventing an arms race in space. We would like to, at the outset, warn against agreeing upon some fragmentary or non inclusive rules on space activities which do not take into account the approaches of all UN Member States. All which might aim to ensure dominance in state in space by a small number of states. Rather than resolving the key task of preventing an arms race in space. Agreeing upon such rules would not allow for their maintenance of international peace and security. It would lead to an escalation of tension in space and general disunity of the international community. And it would prevent equal access to space. For its exploration and for its use for people peaceful purposes. In the context of issues which are examined by the OEWG. We would like to confirm our position that. Looking at the applicability of international humanitarian law when it comes to spacefaring states is something that we do not consider to be suitable or appropriate. International humanitarian law. And law and armed conflicts. Are a specific subject of international legal regulation. Regarding defense for and protection for victims of conflict of war. As well as rules for conduct within a war. Discussions on the applicability or the non applicability of international humanitarian law. Will automatically. Result in conclusions. About whether a space might a war rather might arise in space. And setting the question in such a way. In fact, one's counter to International Space law. In line with which. Activities conducting conducted in space and on celestial bodies. Are only possible for peaceful purposes. Humanity has a general interest, a shared interest in the development and use space. For peaceful purposes. And this was reflected in the major agreement on space of 1967. The Russian Federation believes that there is a need for the AWG. To achieve results which would allow. For achievements to be made which would not allow for an arms race to be conducted in space. And would allow for the development of a legally binding instrument. Which would contain guarantees preventing weapons being placed in space and preventing the use of force or the threat of the use of force with regard to space objects or using them? Thank you for your attention.",4
S2M222,2,2,Australia,"Thank you, Chair. As this is the first time my delegation has formally taken the floor at this session, I would like to assure you of the full support of my delegation and express our gratitude to you for your efforts in preparing for this meeting. I also acknowledge the passing of Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth the 2nd. I would also like to take this opportunity to again reiterate Australia's full support for Ukraine's independent and territorial integrity. Chair As we established at the first session in May, space increasingly touches every aspect of our lives, from the global economy and international communication networks to military and defense capabilities globally. Through open and fruitful exchanges back in May, there was consensus that international law applies in outer space. With similarly look forward to working towards developing consensus during our discussions this week as we turn our collective attention to space threats. Australia is concerned about the behaviours that jeopardise freedom of access to space, endanger manned or unmanned space systems of other nations or put the peaceful and free use of space at risk. Perceived or actual threats against based systems contribute to geopolitical instability and insecurity and put people and property at risk. Chair, my delegation believes that a clear understanding of how we might frame a threat can contribute to a collective understanding of how we can reduce such threats through responsible behaviours. This supports the shared interests of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding. As expressed by many of our esteemed panelists in this morning's session, a common lexicon as well as a common understanding of the elements that comprise a threat, are important to the security of the space domain. We welcome the efforts of the panelists in this morning's session to introduce and explore these ideas. Australia has noted in previous discussions terms such as threat, hazard, risk and danger have been used interchangeably or with different interpretations. It is more difficult to discuss issues in the space domain when key terms are defined differently among nations. Australia seeks to better understand what is meant by the term threat. Our thinking is continuing to evolve in this respect. Noting that the definition of threat in this context is unsettled and will remain subject to discussions by this working group, we wish to lay the foundations for a conceptual discussion. To support open-ended working group discussions, we would like to share some of our thinking by the following framework. Australia considers the following elements could inform the working group's consideration of what constitutes a threat in outer space. Behavioural conduct by an actor with intent. Causing or having the potential to cause detriment to persons or things. I'll address each of these five elements in turn. The first element is behavior. In the context of this discussion, we consider a behaviour is the conduct of an actor with the capability or represented capacity. Sorry, an actor with a capacity or represented capacity to cause detriment to another act of people, property, or interests. The second element is that there must be an actor. While the work of the open-ended working group generally deals with the conduct of states, we acknowledge that in certain circumstances states may also be responsible for the conduct of non state actors. The third element considers the intent of the actor. We believe the term threat should include a mental component on the part of the actor undertaking the behaviour. We're open to discussion on appropriate, standard or whether knowledge, recklessness or negligence are relevant considerations. The last two elements cause or potential to cause and detriment or potential detriment are closely linked. So this 4th element is an appropriate causal link between the behavior and the resultant or potentially resultant detriment. The fifth element is a consequence of the actors behaviour. For something to be a threat, it must have the potential to cause detriment to another act as people, property or interests as a consequence of the behaviour. As well as these potential elements, Australia wishes to shed light on two other factors. Firstly, in the context of the alleged, in which the alleged threat is occurring is vital. For example, whether a state impacted by a space activity has consented to that activity may be a relevant factor in determining whether the activity constitutes a threat. However, consent by 1 actor would not extend to behaviour that poses a threat for a second or further actor who was not consented. Secondly, Australia considers that we should focus on the effects of an active behaviour rather than the capabilities when discussing threats. In other words, we should be capability neutral. The type of capability does not always dictate the manner or method of its use. If we focus on common elements that need to be present for a threat to occur, this allows any capability to be measured against these objective characteristics. Finally, Australia also believes it is valuable to establish what is not a threat. Words such as hazard and risk have been used interchangeably in discussions thus far. Under the potential framework we have outlined, a hazard would pose a risk but not a threat. To illustrate, a space weather event does not have the elements of behavior by an actor and intent by that actor, so therefore would not constitute a threat under this framework, but would still present a risk to space systems. Australia considers it important for states to agree on the use of particular nomenclature to assist in providing A baseline for these discussions. This is to ensure that any potential norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors appropriately address such threats. That's right. Here encourages other states to share their views on what constitutes a space threat. We look forward to the discussions this week and thank you for your kind attention.",0
S2M224,2,2,France,"Merci Bebo, Commercial President. Thank you, Chair. I would just like to take this opportunity, as I'm taking the floor for the first time to greet all of my colleagues from the capitals and Geneva who have met here today. I would also like Chair, to express our support for you as a Chair of this working group and to express to you, Francis, full commitment in working towards the final report which we will be submitting to the General Assembly. France allows itself fully with the objective of this OEWG. Which, through its inclusive nature, should allow the whole of the international community to be brought together to examine issues of safety and security which have a direct impact on our economies and societies, in order to set norms and principles and principles of responsible behavior in space. The excellent debates which were held at the first session of the OEWG last May, show a growing interest in these subjects in particular, I would highlight. Firstly, it all shared a desire to ensure the full, complete application of international law with regard to space. Secondly, that there was also a will to take into account the effect of space activities. Given the duality of space objects, which means that it is more difficult to detect or attribute certain activities, and which increases the risk of misunderstandings, miscalculations and escalations in space, as many colleagues have already mentioned, thirdly. All existing threats should be tackled and finally. There was a jointly expressed will to make progress towards having a joint understanding of objective voluntary Norms of Responsible Behavior Chair for swift growth of Space Activities and the dual nature of these activities and the essential support that they provide to the functioning of our economies and societies is meaning that there is an increased security challenge. However, today we are seeing a deterioration of space given the fact that there is growing military competition amongst the great powers and destabilising an irresponsible behaviour. This is happening within a general context of an erosion to the stability architecture of the world, augmented by military aggression against Ukraine, which we roundly condemn. The objective of this session is, as you said, to examine threats that states pose or will pose. To state systems as well as measures. Activities and emissions which might be judged to be irresponsible. This discussion is in itself a confidence building measure to improve our joint understanding of what threats are. To add to our debate, France has submitted a working paper and I will just go through the broad outlines. Space activities are more and more difficult to monitor, detect and characterize today, especially when we want to ultimately attribute facts to a certain player. This difficulty is growing in is growing and there is a risk of misinterpretations and misunderstandings. We are also seeing many growing hybrid strategy. As well as methods of harassment and demonstrations of force in space. There is a lack of transparency coming from certain. Stakeholders on their capacities and doctrines, which might increase tension and give rise to the risk of an uncontrollable escalation. We believe that three major risks should be taken into account firstly. Behaviour could involve an increased risk of damage to the environment, including the kinetic destruction of satellites. In particular, we're thinking about intentional acts such as anti satellite launches, which might cause multiple debris and hinder the freedom of access and use of space. We would like to commend the commitment that's been undertaken by the United States to not carry out testing, test launches of such nature, which we believe will create a new cycle of confidence. Next, there is behavior which could increase disruption to space systems or allow for uncontrolled escalation. There are certain proximity maneuvers which affect the capacities of other states. These could be a threat when there is no confidence or transparency building measure in particular, for example, when there is a debris removal mission. Behavior can also have an impact on the security of persons as well as assets. We're thinking of any action which comes from space or from the Earth. For example, interference, anti satellite launches, dazzling cyber attacks and so on. These can have effects on satellites which guide navigation systems. For aircraft or ships or impact meteorological or emergency systems, we would like to align ourselves with the contribution made by the European Union. Chair, I can we would like to reassure you that France stands ready to commit itself objectively and in a specific way to the work that is being conducted under your leadership. All of the experts who make up my delegation will be here this week in order to provide you with any clarification. On what we believe are the threats that space activities face today, I also hope that they will be able to provide clarification with regard to recommendations that this working group might. With regard to potential norms, rules, and principles for responsible behavior in space, thank you.",0
S2M226,2,2,Russia,"Thank you, distinguished Chair. Once again we have been forced to take the floor on a point of order in line with Rule 71. We really regret. Chair that you did not give us the floor at the point when we requested the floor. As is stipulated in Rule 71. However, we stand ready to, after the intervention, to explain the reason for raising a point of order. The reason behind this is that the delegations of Australia and of France are once again attempting to look at issues which have nothing to do with the topic under examination and which go beyond the mandate of this open-ended working group. These are to do with issues related to the special military operation in Ukraine. We understand that perhaps these delegations would like to discuss these issues at this group. However, this is not the subject of today's discussions. Therefore distinguish Jan. We would like to once again request, in line with Rule 78 of the Rules of Procedure of the UN General Assembly, that you call to order the delegations of Australia and France. And also. To ask them to strictly to comply with the topic of discussion at hand. For the OEWG, this is issues related to threats and challenges when it comes to space objects and systems. If this will continue if the delegations. Will try to bring up issues which have nothing to do with the topics at hand for the OWG. We will once again be forced to take the floor on a point of order and to request that we be given the floor at the time when we make such a request. Moreover, we would just like to also state that if the goal of those delegations is to politicize our discussions. Then we can only regret that. Such attempts to politicize this. Will not have any positive impact. On the work of the owg. They will not enable. Us to reach consensus between the delegations. More likely, it will be the opposite, that highly politicized statements will only lead to disunity amongst the international community. We'll divide the states who are taking part in this OEWG and will create. Serious obstacles to us reaching A consensus based understanding at this group. Thank you.",2
S2M228,2,2,Norway,"Thank you, Chair. Allow me first to convey the appreciation of the Norwegian delegation for your efforts to convene this second session and for your able moderation about our deliberations. We are pleased to return to this open-ended working group. As noted at the first session in May, actors across all our societies rely on services supplied by space systems. Therefore, the security of those systems is essential for all states as well as the non governmental actors. A multi stakeholder approach with the attendance of international organizations, commercial actors and civil society representatives remains as important as ever. The first session reflected the agreement among states that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to the conduct of states in outer space. We were pleased to see broad agreement, with some notable exceptions, that this would include international humanitarian law in the case of one conflict related to outer space. Recognizing the applicability of humanitarian law is, as was noted by the ICRC, not to legitimize the use of force in outer space, nor its militarisation or weaponization. The UN Charter asset applies to activity in space, as on the Earth obligate states to refrain from the threat or use of force against other states. The existence of IHL does of course not diminish this obligation either in space or on Earth. Norway is mindful of all these obligations. All states must remain committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space and refrain from conducting activities contrary to their obligations under international law. This includes activities that could threaten the ability of all states to freely use and explore outer space, now or in the future. The concept of responsible behavior offers a comprehensive approach to maintaining security in outer space. We are therefore pleased to see that this session is set up so that threats to space systems are not narrowly understood as threats that may only arise in space or are directed towards space. Space systems have elements both on the ground and in space. Threats towards them may emanate from anywhere. It therefore makes sense to divide the discussion on current and future threats by there, as it were, origin and direction. Earth to space, Space to space, Space to Earth and Earth to Earth. This ensures that the discussion properly takes into account the fact that threats to space systems encompass more than kinetic threats to space objects and the use of weapons in space. Dealing with such kinetic type threats, including the use of weapons as we traditionally understand that term, is of course necessary, but it is not sufficient even in the absence of weapons in space. And even if the development of all directors sent anti satellite missiles were deceased immediately, they could still be threats to space systems, threats that could exacerbate tensions, start escalatory cycles and impact global peace and security. Norway finds it important that this working group brings the discussion forward by taking us beyond the narrow set of threats. For instance, over the last few years, Norway has experienced several instances of GPS jamming that is supposed to risk to public safety, but may potentially also pose a risk to other space systems. We will return to this issue in greater detail later in the week. It is still essential to avoid and mitigate threats to the space segment of space systems. To this end, Norway welcomed the decision of the United States, announced in the previous session of this working group and now joined by a number of other states not to conduct destructive direct descent anti satellite missile testing. This decision confirms conforms to a norm of responsible behaviour that deserves wider adoption and even stronger norm of responsible behaviour than that would broaden the kinds of anti satellite capabilities that should not be developed further. For example, there have been reports of Co orbital anti satellite systems that could threaten the space segment of space systems. While weapons should not be placed in space, previous efforts towards this end have taken a narrow approach that rendered them flawed. A peaceful approach to what sorts of threats should be addressed first and which can be left for later does not sufficiently enhance space security as a whole. Again, it is through its holistic and comprehensive approach that this working group can address space security in a way that can move the issue forward. As a steadfast proponent of seeking multilateral solutions to global challenges, Norway is pleased to take part in these discussions. And finally, since we are on the topic of threats, irresponsible behaviour and respect for internationally agreed norms, it is pertinent to recall that again our session takes place while Russia continues its illegal and unprovoked attack on Ukraine that remains A flagrant breach of the most fundamental rules of international relations. Including the UN Charter. We repeat our call for the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops and stop its aggression against Ukraine. Thank you. I have.",4
S2M230,2,2,Russia,"Thank you, distinguished Chair. Once again, we've had to take the floor on a point of order. In line with Rule of Procedure 71, in response to the statement from the representative of Norway. The final part of which statement? As the previous statements which were made by the European Union, Australia and France. Is not in line with the topic being discussed by the OEWG. As we said, we will be taking the floor on a point of order. So that the work of the second session of the OEWG. He is fully in line with the Rules of Procedure, which we confirmed at the organizational session. If a number of delegations. Wish to violate the Rules of Procedure. Well, in our view, this is disrespect to the forum as a whole. As well as to all participants of this forum. This does not enable. The group to resolve the tasks set before it. It leads to politicization of our work. As well as drawing up barriers between various participants. Moreover. This leads to an erosion of the topic that is being discussed at hand. If this practice will continue. And the delegation of the Russian Federation. Will have to provide a response. And not within a right to reply. But within a separate statement. This is because. As the delegations I have referred to consider, this topic is fully under their mandate of this group. In this in their view, and can be discussed at this forum. So therefore chair. We would like to ask you to call to order. The women and ask delegations to refrain from referring to topics which are not subject to discussion by the AWG. This is in your hands. And you are the defender of the Rules of Procedure at this forum. Therefore. If you do not curb such attempts to politicize this forum, then we will have to respond as I've just said. In a separate statement on this topic. However, I fear. That this would not enable. Us to have a normal discussion between the participants of the OWG and it will also not enable the group to achieve success. Thank you.",2
S2M232,2,2,Italy,"Mr. Chair, Italy fully aligns itself with the statement of the European Union. I would like to add some remarks in my national capacity. At the outset, let me congratulate you and your team for your work in leading us to the second session of the open-ended working group. We are confident that under your guidance, we will be able to make a useful contribution to a common goal of achieving a common understanding of how best to act to reduce threats to space systems in order to maintain outer space as a peaceful, secure, stable and sustainable environment. Free from an arms race and conflict for the benefit of all, Mr. Chair. Italy believes that the second session of the open-ended working group paves the way for a constructive effort to identify irresponsible and threatening actions in outer space and their impact on International Security, and to address these challenges through the adoption of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour. The current strategic space environment appears increasingly congested, contested and competitive. We are very aware of the increasing dependence of our societies on the use of outer space. Space based and space related products and services and now an integral part of modern life and are expected to become an indispensable component for every person on Earth. On the one hand, thanks to unprecedented technological developments, the area of interest of space activities is extending from orbits around the Earth to celestial bodies throughout the solar system. On the other hand, there is a growing risk that irresponsible behaviour in all new space activities may threaten human health as well as socio economic stability and security. In this context, the development and proliferation of new dual use technologies, capabilities and systems have blurred line between military and civilian use, making it more complicated to protect and defend space assets and identify threats. For this reason, security from and in space no longer appears to be a purely military and national issue, but rather a multi sectoral and global issue that needs to be addressed at the international level. With the broadest engagement of all UN Member States, international organizations, commercial actors and civil society representatives. Therefore, we emphasize the need to ensure the peaceful use of outer space and to address potential escalation dynamics and the security threats these may pose. We feel a sense of urgency in this regard. Mr. Chair, potentially hostile activities are on the rise, rise and increasingly affect the stability and security of outer space. Space debris management. The possible effects of the deployment of large constellations on the orbital debris environment, possible risks imposed on space missions by new applications, and emerging threats to the security and resilience of orbital infrastructures require attention. Hybrid space operations span an increasing number of sectors, adding an extra layer of complexity to risk and threat assessments and areas of potential regulation. Threats more closely related to potentially hostile behavior include the use of electronic warfare to overwhelm satellites and compromise their operation, or use of laser beams to damage optical sensors, although threat perceptions vary widely. There are at least 4 scenarios that require attention space to space threats, Space to Earth, Earth to space, and Earth to Earth threats to space systems. Some issues are considered particularly urgent, such as the persistent development or testing of anti satellite missiles. Such activities are of great concern because they create long lasting debris clouds compromising the security of outer space activities. This is why we welcomed the commitment, but the United States joined by other states not to conduct destructive tests of directors and anti satellite missiles. Mr. Chair, we are ready to work constructively in the second session of the OEWG on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors. We assure you of the full support and cooperation of our delegation throughout the week. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M234,2,2,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to provide remarks regarding today's Panel one discussion on nature and use of outer space environment and space systems in relation to current and future threats by states to space systems. Let me first thank you and the secretariat for your hard work on this important issue. The work we are doing here is an opportunity for the international community to enhance space security. It is also a format where every UN member state has a voice. In that regard, we appreciate your leadership in this challenging but important task and your willingness to participate in a demonstration of non consensual rendezvous and proximity operations. I also want to thank the speakers for their presentations and for their willingness to answer our questions. The panelists during the first session of the open-ended working group provided an excellent foundation by helping us discuss and understand different perspectives regarding the existing legal framework for outer space, including the applicability of international humanitarian law. And even then, in those discussions, delegations discussed potential threats to space systems and proposed actions this group could pursue to strengthen transparency and norms, rules and principles related to responsible behavior for national security space activities. This second session of the open-ended working group will help us gain a better understanding about the many types of capabilities which could threaten space systems and ultimately help inform our discussions in January on steps we can take to address these threats in a way that complements the existing international legal framework pertaining to national security space activities. Mr. Chairman, 60 years ago today, U.S. President John F Kennedy delivered an address on the Future of American Space program. That presented a positive vision for how the use of space could improve life on Earth. Even then, in 1962, he saw the challenges of space, stating quote. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding. Today, space has become a much more integral part of everyday life, in ways that couldn't have been imagined when President Kennedy made those remarks 60 years ago. But we can all appreciate the relevance it has to every person that our countries here represent. Our presenters today did an excellent job explaining the importance of the global benefits of space services. Space activities power our economies and our way of life. Data products and services from space enable businesses and create jobs in sectors as varied as manufacturing, transportation, logistics, agriculture, finance and communications. We rely upon satellites to improve our lives and our communities, such as by enabling global navigation, assisting with crop yield prediction, water management and power grid monitoring, and facilitating global telecommunications for applications ranging from banking to education to telemedicine. Developing space technologies spurs innovation. The Space Foundation AUS nonprofit organization determined that 469 billion. U.S. dollars was spent on outer space activities just last year. New space goods and services create new industries and jobs, such as in clean energy, technology and broadband access, providing increased opportunities for equitable economic growth and development in historically underserved or disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, space activities fuel cutting edge research and technology development, yielding new discoveries that improve the quality of life for people on Earth. However, these space systems are fragile and vulnerable to both natural threats and human made threats. As more nations and more services depend on space based capabilities. Especially in critical social and economic sectors such as medical disaster response, weather forecasting and financial transactions. The loss or degradation of those capabilities will increasingly disrupt daily life. Actions taken by any nation to interfere with space services used or operated by the military most likely would also deny civilian space services as well, either accidentally or on purpose. As Mr. Black mentioned this morning, there are many types of anti satellite weapons systems that could be discussed during our meetings this week and we will have an opportunity to discuss these threats in detail. Importantly, his presentation shows that we cannot just focus on the placement of weapons in outer space if we want to make progress in addressing this broad scope of threats created by the misuse of potential counter space weapons. There are many ground based systems that are being developed to attack space systems. Some of them create reversible impacts on satellites, such as jamming. And some create irreversible impacts such as destructive attacks by direct descent anti satellite missiles. We have seen countries use satellite communications jammers and GPS jammers. Which, in the case of GPS jammers, can cause civilian flight delays or cancellations. We have seen countries hit and kill satellites with direct descent anti satellite missiles. And create clouds of long lived debris during testing. We have seen countries highlight disruption of ground based satellite observation systems as a military threat. And recently, during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, we saw a cyber attack against a Ukrainian satellite network, which disrupted the satellite communications terminal. A subject very relevant to our discussions this week. In that regard, let me once again reiterate the United States strong support for the Ukrainian Government and Ukrainian people in its fight for its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Now, Mr. Clark's presentation did an excellent job highlighting the benefits of these space services, the challenges of operating them and the challenges of verification and attribution in outer space. For a commercial communications satellite to get a return on the $300 million cost of the satellite, it must produce $2.20 of revenue every second for 15 years. The disruption of that activity could have a significant impact on a company or a country. His presentation also succinctly explained what we can see from the ground using telescopes. Those dots of light that his company tracks can help him determine when things are going well and sometimes see when things go wrong, but is largely the behavior of these satellites that he can track. Those telescopes can usually see where a satellite is and whether it's in one piece. But as he showed, he doesn't always know what they're doing, how they are doing something, or why they are doing something. That is an important point for our consideration. It is incredibly challenging to say with certainty whether there is a weapon on orbit. As demonstrated by Mr. Clark, this is partly because telescopes on the ground only see a dot of light. Partly also because dual purpose systems make defining a weapon difficult. Moreover, it is hard to know what the capabilities of that satellite are. Unlike other terrestrial arms control regimes, we do not have the mechanisms for a robust verification regime that would allow us to determine with certainty whether, for example, a satellite has a missile on it, or whether a satellite is programmed to behave in a way consistent with a weapon. But instead, what his presentation does show is that we can track some behaviors of satellites in certain orbits. Because of a long history of operating commercial communications satellites, we have a good idea what their usual behavior in outer space looks like when they are operating normally. And while we may not know what a satellite is capable of doing, developing transparency measures or norms of behavior can help determine. When it is behaving abnormally or inconsistently. In turn, behavior consistent with established norms of behavior could reduce the risk of miscommunication, miscalculation, and misunderstanding. Which raises tension and potentially leads to conflict. Many of presentations this morning further highlighted the challenges we face when discussing what constitutes a threat because of dual purpose systems. Many space capabilities and technologies are inherently dual purpose, which presents both practical and conceptual problems when attempting to identify and respond to potential threats. For example, all satellites with maneuvering capabilities, if launched into the proper orbit, could technically be used to attempt to collide with another satellite, even if not optimized to do so. As another example, States and commercial entities are developing on orbit, servicing satellites and active debris removable capabilities. On orbit servicing satellites could allow for the extension of the life of a satellite and in the future may be able to repair and build satellites in orbit. Active debris removal systems may have the ability to maneuver or deorbit non operational satellites, rocket bodies and other debris. Thereby helping to preserve the long term sustainability of the outer space environment. Both on orbit, surfacing and active debris removal satellites would require various mechanisms to grab or attach themselves to their intended satellites. Some on orbit demonstrations have included the use of a net, harpoon or a magnet to accomplish this task. Robotic arms could also be used for this type of activity. This capability to grapple another satellite is inherently dual use. Such a capability could be used to repair. Service or dispose of a satellite. Or alternatively, to degrade or destroy another satellite. Mr. Chairman, we have an opportunity here to develop ideas for transparency measures and norms of responsible behavior that can protect the outer space environment from the misuse of such capabilities and that can reduce the risk of miscalculation and misunderstanding. We need to approach these discussions with a sense of urgency and an openness to consider all options to address threats that could impact all capability, all countries ability to use space based services. At the same time, we need to take a deliberate, careful approach to ensure that we don't actually make things worse by inadvertently creating norms, rules and principles constraining new novel and valuable capabilities because they have an inherent ability to miss be misused due to their dual purpose nature. In fact, as demonstrated by the speaker's remarks this morning, in our deliberations on next step we must carefully consider the challenges of definitions, verification and dual use systems. Otherwise, we could actually increase misunderstandings or miscalculations, something I think we all agree we should seek to avoid. In this regard, the United States does not believe that conflict in outer space is inevitable. the United States seeks to ensure that outer space remains free from conflict and has long advocated for an approach that seeks to comprehensively address all threats to space systems, not just the placement of weapons in outer space. Preventing an arms race in outer space and preventing outer space from becoming an arena of conflict is crucial to safeguarding the long term use of space for peaceful purposes. We have made that clear in the previous session of this open-ended working group in the Conference on Disarmament and in discussions at UN Copious. We believe this focus on norms, rules and principles is the most promising approach, but we must be deliberate and thoughtful in our application in order to establish meaningful measures which enable risk reduction and avoid conflict without hindering the peaceful uses of outer space. Mr. Chairman, during his speech 60 years ago, President Kennedy stated that space is hard and apropos of our deliberations here, called it a challenge we are willing to accept and one we are unwilling to postpone. With that in mind, the United States looks forward to participating in the important discussions this week. Thank you.",0
S2M236,2,2,Switzerland,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I would also like to thank you for the manner in which you have been organizing our work, and I assure you of the full support of my delegation. We also thank you for your summary of the first session of our group, which has been very useful in capturing the key aspects of our discussions. Switzerland welcomes the second session of the open-ended Working Group on Reducing Space Threats, dedicated to considering current and future threats by states to space systems and actions, activities and omissions that could be considered irresponsible. We thank you and this morning morning's panelists for their presentations that allowed us to have a first broad look at the question before going into more specifics in the course of this week. Likewise, we are grateful to the Philippines and Germany as well as Unidire for their working papers on the issue that we read with great interest. As panelists under. We witnessed significant developments in outer space over the past years. All states are more and more dependent on space assets. The resulting congestion and competition between states has resulted in increased safety, security and sustainability challenges regarding outer space activities. At the same time, military competition between certain states in outer space has increased or threatens to extend to outer space. An increasing number of states are using space to enhance their military capabilities and national security. Various military operations rely on space based technologies including command and control systems. In response to these developments, a growing number of countries have been developing counter space capabilities including kinetic, non kinetic, electronic and cyber capabilities. The potential use of such counter space capabilities poses risks not only to military space systems. But also to civil and commercial ones. On the one hand, it may be difficult to circumscribe to circumscribe an attack to a single space system and avoid vital repercussions. On the other, many space systems are of two use nature. Furthermore, the targeting of military space systems can lead to serious threats to International Security, as some command and control systems are relevant to both conventional and nuclear capabilities. In addition, the adoption of doctrines by some States and military alliances considering outer space as a war fighting domain also raises concerns and could lead to a vicious cycle by incentivising others to do so as well. Kinetic counter space capabilities which cause permanent and irreversible destruction exacerbates the risks to the peaceful use of outer space. In this context, the development, testing and potential use of direct ascent anti satellite weapons has become a particular concern. There are clear risks associated with these weapons, including the generation of long living debris which puts the security, safety and sustainability of space activities at risk, including those of civilian nature. Measures to prevent the development and use of such capabilities should constitute a priority. And we welcome the announcements by a number of states that they will refrain from testing any kinetic anti satellite systems that generates generates space debris. Likewise counter space capabilities of non kinetic nature including optical, electronic and cyber capabilities. Can threaten civil and military space assets alike. Although such capabilities do not necessarily cause permanent physical damage, they may temporarily disable space assets that are of critical nature and affect the reliability of critical infrastructure. Such behavior may trigger retaliatory measures or result in inoperable space assets that may turn into space debris, presenting a safety danger. Additionally, some of these counter space capabilities are hard to detect and attribute increasing mistrust and the risk of misinterpretation. Co orbital assets are especially inclined to increase mistrust as their maneuvers do not take place immediately after the object is placed into orbit, but can remain dormant. Furthermore, the placement of weapons in outer space in the form of space to ground weapons or missile interceptors also has the potential to increase the risk of turning space into a war fighting domain. And negatively impact its peaceful use. Countermeasure to those threats would again pose further risks to space security and stability. But concerns are not limited to the development or deployment of certain capabilities. They also extend to the way in which certain activities are conducted in outer space. Unfriendly orbital rendezvous and proximity operations represent a threat to the safety and security of space systems. Unexpected close approaches to foreign satellites without notification, coordination, and consent. May be interpreted as a hostile act. Appeals can be used to observe, threaten, or disable the satellite of another country. The threat or hostile of hostile RPO's may lead countries to equip their satellites with defensive capabilities, which may contribute to the weaponization and instability of outer space. Adopting and respecting transparency and safety measures is therefore key when conducting RPO's. Mr. Chair. From Switzerland standpoint, steps must be taken to avoid interference with the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and to ensure that armed conflicts do not extend to outer space. In this regard, and given the inherent challenges associated with the appraisal of space activities, let alone the challenge to assess the intention behind certain action actions, a behaviour based and outcome oriented approach constitutes A promising way forward. A focus on behaviors and their consequences allows to assess the outcomes of a given action independent of their supposed or actual intention. Furthermore, it could help us in moving towards more stringent, legally binding measures in the future. We believe many of the challenges can be addressed by strengthening the implementation of existing obligations on the international law, including by improving transparency measures and notification mechanisms, as well as by enhancing situational awareness capabilities and international collaboration in specific areas. In addition, we should also consider restricting certain activities and behaviors, such as attacks that do not necessarily amount to the threshold of the use of force, or hostile activities that have adverse effects on space objects or the orbital environment. For instance, through the creation of debris. In this context, we should thoroughly consider the limits imposed by international humanitarian law on any potential use of force in outer space, in particular the principles of proportionality and distinction. Due to the dual loose nature of many space systems and the difficulty to confine the effects of certain types of attacks in space, most types of military attacks in outer space would probably be prohibited by IHL. Mr. Chair. Further work remains to be done to develop and agree on the norms needed to guarantee stability and security in outer space. Which is conditioned for the long term, sustainable and peaceful use of outer space. We hope that the OWG space will be able to elaborate concrete recommendations with the ultimate objective of agreeing on appropriate norms and legal principles to contain the multiple threats from to and in space. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M238,2,2,The Republic of Korea,"Mr. Chair, let me assure you of my delegation's full support for your efforts. You successfully organized the first meeting of the open-ended working group, which provided A valuable opportunity to take stock of the existing international and legal normative framework concerning threats arising from state behavior with respect to outer space. We also saw clear convergence towards a more strengthened framework in order to effectively address space security concerns and rapid technological developments. We thank you for your concise summary, which will capture the week's discussion and look forward to continuing our work under your Able leadership. Mr. Chair, with ever increasing actors, activities, interdependency and ever progressing technology, we should stop repeating what we have done in past decades. Instead we call for a more forward-looking, action oriented discussions with a sense of urgency. We would very much like to see this OEWG come up with concrete recommendations as stipulated in resolution. 76/231 which gave birth to the OEWG. I would like to reiterate my delegation's basic position that any activities intended to destroy, damage, deny, disturb or degrade other states space assets should be deemed as a threat. Space threats includes, but are not limited to, the arms race in space. The intention is key in defining a thread, but we also understand that this is a difficult task. Therefore, the ROK government believes that defining space threats based on the action and behavior, rather than the capability and object itself, is more appropriate. Focusing only on the arms race risks focusing on the capability and object. That's not covering all the three, all the threats in outer space. Failure to define challenges that we face would lead to response failure. Also, a significant increase of actors, the progress of technology, inherent dual use characteristics of space systems, and a high possibility of miscalculation and miscommunication call for a holistic and comprehensive approach to defining threats. The Cold War has left many traces in the history of multilateralism. A focus on the arms race and traditional arms control approach would be the sum of examples of those traces. With the advent of New space era and the constant failure of past decades, Korea believes that a threat discussion based on a behavior based approach can generate some practical and realistic actions. These actions may not seem enough for some countries, however, leaving the vacuum of norms, principles and regulations unattended would be more detrimental than doing what can be done. Mr. Chair, this week's discussion will be a starting point to identify challenges needing a response. Korea hopes that we will be able to find common ground on defining space threats and share what most Member States consider pressing threats. We'll be able to have in depth discussion on what activities or behaviors can be regarded as threat to space security, but please allow me to highlight some of the. Areas that my delegation is particularly interested in and seems married for further work. Korea is of the view that destructive direct ascent anti satellite missile testing is one of the significant threats from Earth to space as it creates long lived space debris and can endanger any satellites or human in space. In this context we welcome once again the US commitment not to conduct those tests and welcome the relay of such commitments in the international community as an example of responsible behavior. Non kinetic physical attacks and electronic attacks to space system is another area that we would like to bring attention to the international community. Lasers and uplink jammers in particular can directly or indirectly result in damages in space system and Arrogant government believes that this would negatively affect the ship security of space systems. We would also like to bring special attention to rendezvous in proximity operation RPO. While RPO operation is regarded important for ensuring the sustainability of outer space activities, such capabilities are inherently of dual use and could be used to damage degree or destroy a satellite. It is also noted that any satellite capable of carrying out rendezvous and proximity operations and placed in the same orbit as another satellite could be regarded as a threat. Increasing space debris is also of concern to us. However, we are mindful of the discussions taking place within CORPUS and very useful guidelines that came out following the decades of discussion. We are in favor of avoiding overlaps, but we also see the merit of considering space debris from the threat perspective within the OWG. Mr. Chair, taking this opportunity, I would like to introduce Korea's recent activities in space security cooperation briefly. Korea in this Korea is strongly committed to enhancing the safety, stability and sustainability of space. Therefore, we Co organized a virtual conference on May 23rd and 24th with the UNIDIRE and SECURE World Foundation to foster dialogue towards a common understanding of threats and responsible behaviors within countries from ASEAN. We also hope this second meeting can be more inclusive and universal, with more countries actively joining the discussion. Our summary report of this conference is available through the OWG website. I'm also happy to share that the space security will be one of the two topics of this year's Rock UN Joint Conference on Disarmament and Non Proliferation issues, which will be held in Seoul on 3rd and 4th of November. We hope this conference can serve as a platform for dynamic and frank discussions on space security issues rapidly unfolding in the face of new and emerging challenges in the International Security environment. With these remarks, we look forward to a fruitful discussion and hope this second meeting will be more inclusive and universal with more countries actively joining the discussion. Thank you.",0
S2M240,2,2,Canada,"Thank you, Chair Chair, Distinguished colleagues, Canada would like to express our gratitude to the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs and to the Chair for your outstanding support to the OEWG. Your team has once again prepared an impressive series of panel of experts which will help spark engaging and substantive discussions. Canada welcomes the opportunity to participate in the second session of the OEWG and recognizes the topics importance. Actions in space will be viewed on a spectrum as there is no universally accepted guideline of what constitutes threatening behaviors. Our challenge this week is to reach a level of understanding of those actions that could be viewed as threatening or irresponsible, to ensure that one's activities are not misinterpreted and which could lead to misunderstandings, disputes, or conflict. Chair threats in outer space cannot be inferred from capabilities alone. The dual use nature of many space related technologies means they cannot be categorized as simply peaceful or not. For this reason, Canada views threats as a combination of capabilities and behaviors. In our submission to UNGA Resolution 7536, which we have also submitted as a non paper to the OEWG, we listed examples of potential threatening and irresponsible behaviors. These included deliberate state actions, operations, or activities intended to damage or destroy space systems. It is important to highlight that the space system includes not just satellites in space, but all the elements needed to function, such as ground infrastructure and the data links connecting them to satellites. A narrow focus on certain technology or locations alone cannot ensure stability if other threats to space systems and actors remain unaddressed. This behavior based approach is much more effective in addressing dual use. Capabilities remains applicable irrespective of whatever new space technology emerges. In other words, it is technology neutral and does not impose additional technological or financial barriers to the exploration and use of outer space by all. The benefits of this behavior based approach can be demonstrated more concretely through an example. As many are aware, Canada pioneered our Canadarm series of remote manipulator systems, which have supported astronaut space walks, captured satellites for repair, and built the International Space Station. During the development of Canada Arm one, many states expressed concern that what we were trying to do was weaponize space and that the robotic arm could be used for purposes other than for what it was intended. Throughout the development of the first candidate arm and all other subsequent iterations of it, Canada clearly communicated the peaceful purposes for which it would be used. And Canada has remained consistent in our behavior with this tool over the last three decades, demonstrating that it does not threaten the security and stability of outer space. In fact, we believe that by employing Canada and two on the ISS, a collaboration between 15 states, it has contributed to increased cooperation and stability. Through our experience, we know that not all technologies are inherently threatening. It is how they are used that is important. We are at a similar inflection point with other emerging technologies, such as on orbit servicing and active debris removal. But this time we do not have to wait for 30 years of established practice to demonstrate that technology such as this is not inherently threatening. As the discussions this week progress, Canada would encourage all delegations to think about norms of behavior that states could exhibit. That would reduce the perception of threats and prevent miscalculation in the space environment. As we heard from some of the panelists this morning, threats are in part subjective, and perceptions of what constitute a threat will vary among us. Nonetheless, there are a few foundational norms, such as clear and transparent communication that if adopted by the majority of states. Will greatly reduce the risk of misperceptions. Understandings. My final comment is to note that international peace and security starts on earth. With that in mind, Canada reiterates its full support for the people of Ukraine against President Putin's unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion. Chair, I would like to assure you of the full commitment and support of the Canadian delegation towards achieving our common objectives, and we look forward to another constructive and successful session. Thank you for your kind attention.",0
S2M242,2,2,Russia,"Thank you. Thank you, Distinguished Chair. Once again, we've had to take the floor on a point of order. In line with Rule 71 of the Rules of Procedure of the UN General Assembly, in line with the unacceptable and unsubstantiated and provocative statements. Made by the Delegation of Canada with regard to the special military operation in Ukraine. Perhaps the Canadian delegate went out of the room at that point when I took the floor to make a point of order with regard to other delegations who tried to touch upon this issue. However, her colleagues might have been able to tell her. And mention the things that I've already spoken of with regard to this matter. So therefore we trust, we believe, that this is a deliberate step by the delegation of Canada in order to further politicise the discussion. Distract attention of the international community away from the major issues at hand for this working group and also an attempt. To undermine the discussion that we have begun today at this group. The future? We would like to ask you once again. Two, in line with Rule 78, call the Delegation of Canada to order. And to strictly follow. The issues which are on the agenda of this group and are in the mandate of the group to follow up on those issues which are not related. To this when the special military operation in Ukraine is evoked. Thank you.",2
S2M244,2,2,Spain,"Thank you very much, Chairman. First and foremost, I wish to congratulate you for the way in which you've been conducting the work of this group up to now, including the organizing of this second session. Spain entirely endorses a statement made by the European Union and wishes to make the following comments in its national capacity. Space is a common asset whose use can benefit humanity. They're increasing activities in space with an increasing impact on activities on Earth, be they civilian, military or commercial. The new space, A so-called new space, means. That it's no longer simply the proviso of the great powers. We have to think about access to space and we've been incorporating a large number of players, both government and non state. This means that space is a disputed competitive areas where states can carry out a number of activities including that intentionally wish to cause damage threats or others that is a responsible missions. Spain welcomes the open, pragmatic approach of this group. It's an open group because it understands that we have to progressively reach a common understanding of what is responsible behavior. In Spain's view, these multilateral discussions have a value in themselves. It's pragmatic because it's based on. Conduct based discussion. And approaches that are purely based on capacities are much more complex because we don't always understand what the real capacities of functions can be and when technologies can have dual use, including military. Satellite systems can have three elements that can be potentially liable to attack and must be considered. First of all, there are satellites in orbits. And. There can also be a Kinetic Destruction systems and anti satellite weapons. Be they launched from Earth or from orbit are impose a real risk of escalation and cause a lack of confidence in this regard. Spain wishes to indicate the commitment that many states are increasingly making in this regard. Secondly, control centres and for maintaining position. These are attacks which are within the scope of more players. They want to. Destroy capacity and replace the legitimate those usurping of identity or spoofing. There's also a. And other activities against control centers and then there are. Many other activities that are within the scope of actors, including kinetic activities against Earth. Centers. There are cuts in electricity, supplies, etcetera. Against control and command centres. And some damage can be caused to the systems of other states, for example through proximity maneuvers. That can pose threats to the security of the affected satellite. And we have to think about the activities that maintain satellites in orbit. It will therefore be necessary to define in what context. Some considerations have to be taken the absence of informing proximity of. Of not informing A proximity manoeuvres can be considered irresponsible behaviour. We are very interested in the discussions that will take place this week which will allow us to better understand threats. And related matters, you can certainly count on the support of Spain during these discussions. Thank you Representante. My thanks to the distinguished representative of Spain and for her valuable support to the work of this group, almost reaching our end time today. And we still have several speakers on the list. I suggest that we listen to the last speaker of today and the rest will will. Unfortunately for them, we have to speak tomorrow, early in the morning. I I hope you you understand. And I thank you for your flexibility.",0
S2M246,2,2,Brazil,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, before addressing the matters under the purview of the open-ended working group, the Brazilian delegation, like others before us, wishes to extend its profound condolences to the delegation of the United Kingdom for the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second. In its official note dated 8th September, the Brazilian Government highlighted that during her decades long tenure the Queen set a remarkable example of leadership and stability for her country and for the world. Mr. Chairman, let me reiterate the satisfaction of my delegation. Let's see you back to Geneva. We wish to congratulate you on the organization and stewardship of the first substantive session of this open-ended working group last May. My delegation believes that the thematic panels provided an opportunity for valuable exchange between representatives of Member States, academics and researchers who share the wealth of accumulated knowledge on all aspects of space security. We have certainly arrived at this second session with a rather defined picture of the challenges posed by the advancements in space technology and the threats associated with the development of offensive space capabilities by many states. My delegations My delegation appreciates your efforts to condense the discussions on the first session in your chairs summary. We trust that these summaries will be useful to to keep track of our progress. So, Chair, during the May session we discussed extensively on the need to strengthen the legal framework regarding space security. Indeed, we must recognize that the principles and obligations set by the current body of law, which has the 1967 Outer Space Treaty as its centerpiece, provides important foundational principles that must be preserved and built upon. However, it's also clear that the current legal regime is not enough to respond to the essential role played by space capabilities in people's lives nowadays, and, most importantly, to respond to current threats against these capabilities. My delegation hopes that during the second session we ought to dig deeper in the discussions on threats and irresponsible behaviors. We should seek to achieve in this working Group A level of progress in the realm of space security, similar to what has been accomplished by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the Copious, regarding the safety dimension with the adoption of the LTS guidelines. The complementarity between both approaches must be recognized and further explored in order to ensure lasting and concrete sustainability in outer space activities in all its aspects. Mindful of the contrasting positions regarding the best way to address this gap my delegations of the view that this group should not be held hostage by the dispute between those in favor of voluntary norms and those that support the immediate negotiation of a legally binding instrument. In effect, there is no contradiction between these paths being the former, rather a stage settle to the ladder. After all, it's hard to imagine. In which states that are enabled to reach agreement on what is voluntary, we will possibly agree on what is to be mandatory. Furthermore, the best way to create conditions for the negotiation of a treaty prevention of an arms race in outer space is not to engage right now in actions that defeat the very objective of such Treaty. Moreover, my delegation recalls that paragraph 5C of resolution 76E/231 mandates the open-ended working Group to reflect on how its recommendations can't contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments, including on Paris. Let us then take advantage of this working group to address a broad spectrum of space security concerns. With that we will be we will build a solid basis for future negotiations with a view to finally fulfilling the mandate established by the 1978 Special session. Regarding the prevention of arms race in outer space. As reiterated on many occasions, receivers of the view that any conflict in space will seriously endanger the prospects for the sustainable use of earths orbits for peaceful purposes for generations to come. The increasing reliance on space assets accompanied by the development of offensive space capabilities by several states, resulting a complex scenario in which threats might arise from a myriad of fronts, especially considering the dual nature of most space assets. The very subject of this open-ended working group is therefore a matter of profound concern for our states. Regardless of their space capabilities, all of us would be profoundly affected if outer space becomes an arena for conflict. Therefore, a careful assessment of threats is of paramount importance to our task of establishing recommendations that we'll be able to curb these threats. As anticipated in Brazil's national position, in response to the request made by Resolution 75 slash 36 and compiled compiled in Secretary General Report A/76/77, we believe the working group should address issues such as the conduct of Handivu and proximity operation. Operations RPO's without prior warning and consent. Such activities raise suspicions and mistrust and are liable to be misinterpreted, potentially triggering hostile reaction and further escalation of tensions. The possibility of interference with satellite systems through jamming, spoofing and cyber attacks, especially in cases leading to permanent loss of functionality or control of space assets, are also a major threat to space security. Finally, Brazil reiterated its belief that the testing, development and use of destructive anti satellite weapons, a set, stands as the most serious threat to the security and sustainability of outer space. Such weapons are one of the key drivers of mistrust and instability in space and their testing generates significant long lasting debris leading to the contamination of the orbital environment and to the heightening of the risk of collisions. Our accumulated experience with such tests makes it clear that they might have indiscriminate and potentially catastrophic consequences. We just believe that any further testing of destructive ASAP weapons would be inherently incompatible with the principle of due regard enshrined in Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty, and that they're potentially using warfare would be indirect contradiction with the basic principles of international humanitarian law. And with the law on neutrality. In this regard, Brazil understands that the time has come for a ban on destructive anti satellite tests. This can be achieved by means of a multilateral moratorium leading up to a formal prohibition to be enshrined in a future legally binding framework. Mr. As a developing country with considerable space capabilities and aspirations to become a full spacefaring nation, it's in Brazil's utmost interested space remain peaceful, stable, safe and accessible to all. As it was reminded during the presentations this morning, Brazil has one satellite in a geostationary orbit, a unique and relatively scarce resource, So we are acutely aware of the risks derived from the lack of predictability of the behavior of various other actors. To secure that environment, we believe that it's crucial to strengthening the implementation of existing TCBMS, rendering space activities both in orbit and on Earth more transparent and predictable, and therefore less prone to misinterpretation. In that regard, we attach special relevance to information sharing through the broad broader cooperation on space situation awareness. Therefore, recommendations on this topic could be a low hanging fruit for this group, bring concrete benefits in terms of improved transparency and trust. In conclusion, Mr. Chair, I take this opportunity to recall your opening statement in the first session. At that occasion, you said that the challenge in security environment should not be seen as an excuse for inaction, but rather a motivation to face the complex issues before us with a much needed sense of urgency. My delegation couldn't agree more with you and couldn't be more convinced that we should seize this opportunity to make real progress in a matter that directly impacts the lives of all. Thank you.",4
S2M248,2,2,Russia,"Thank you, distinguished Chair. The Russian Federation has had to take the floor as a right of reply. In order to respond. To the unsubstantiated, undocumented and provocative politicised accusations that have been made against my country. With regard to the conducting of the special military operation in Ukraine. We reject all provocation. From the delegations which have been made during this meeting of the OEWG. We believe that these statements. Do not relate to the topic of discussion of the OWG. They are beyond the scope of its mandate and also are irrelevant to the context of the group. And we also consider them to be unsubstantive. The reasons for Russia beginning its special military operation in Ukraine are well known. Since 2014. The Kievan regime has been conducting major aggression against the civilian population in the Donbass. Who did not accept the armed coup d'etat? Constant cause to pay attention to the anti Russian actions of the Kiev regime as well as the socio economic blockade. And murders of civilians in the southeast of the country have been consistently ignored. Quite counter to this, all of these years. The countries of the West instead of forcing Kiev to end its war against the population in the southeast. Have in fact pumped Ukraine full of weapons and ammunition. They have carried out a major joint training. And have constantly be conducting training of Ukrainian servicemen. On the 27th of February 2022. The EU adopted a general decision with regard to providing weapons deliveries to Ukraine. And so in this way, the Member States of the European Union. In fact have shown. What the rule of law means to Europe. They ignored all 88 of the criteria. With regard to their position. With regard to the general position of the EU Council. On establishing general rules for control on the expert on the export rather of military technology and. Equipment which was from December 2008. That directly prohibits deliveries being made from the European Union. Of arms and equipment in a whole number of situations. I will just enumerate the following. This is non compliance with human rights. Including the risk of those weapons being used for internal repression. It includes armed conflicts in the country of destination and the risk of an escalation as a result of those arms being delivered. It also includes a threat to regional peace and security and stability. Including the possibility of an armed conflict. Posed by a third party. To my mind, it's clear that in the current situation. All of those criteria. Absolutely justified. And they are fully relevant to this situation. They are fully in line with it. And they confirm in fact, that these weapons deliveries which were conducted by countries of the European Union. Are a direct violation of their very own norms and regulations, which have been confirmed by the EU Council. In the same way. All of these actions. Which have been conducted since 2014. The root cause of the situation. Which is unfolded in Ukraine. And which led up to February 2022. All of these actions. Have led to the fact that on the 24th of February. The President of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Vladimir Rich Putin. Upon the request of the heads of Donetsk People's Republic and Lagansk People's Republic. And in line with Article 51 of the UN Charter. And. The provisions of agreements on mutual assistance, mutual assistance and friendship. Between the Russian Federation. And those republics? Took a decision to conduct the a special military operation in Ukraine. Currently. The operation is being conducted in full compliance with the plan which was adopted by the Russian Federation. The goals of the operation remain unchanged. You all know them full well. And I can assure those delegations. Who, as part of this important forum, are trying to speculate with regard to the special military operation in Ukraine. Who are trying to politicize the discussion of the open-ended working group that all of those goals will be achieved. In my town, I would like to. Warn the delegations who are working at the OWG to refrain from continuing to politicise. The discussions. This is because. These fakes which have nothing to do with the ogw work. Do not allow us. To accomplish the mandate that this working group has. Quite the opposite in fact. They divide the participants and create obstacles. To achieving consensus with regard to an understanding on the topic under discussion. If the delegations continue to raise this topic at the plenary sessions, we will have to make a separate statement. With a detailed. Going through of all of the approaches and understandings that the Russian Federation holds with regard to the special military operation in Ukraine. I fear that this will not be in the interests of the OWG and it's also not in the interests of those countries. Who are trying to raise these issues here at the odd job We WG thank you very much.",2
S2M32,2,3,The Secure World Foundation,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. My name is Victoria Sampson and I'm the Washington Office Director for the Secure World Foundation. The Secure World Foundation is a private operating foundation dedicated to the secure and sustainable use of outer space for the benefit of all peoples of the Earth. We work with governments, intergovernmental organizations, industry, academia and civil society to develop and promote international cooperation to achieve the secure, sustainable and peaceful uses of outer space. As such, we are delighted to participate here in the second session of this open-ended working group and its mandate to make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors. Relating to threats by states, to space systems. I'm honored to be here on the panel to discuss Topic 2, Current and Future Earth to Space Threats by States to Space Systems. Today I have been asked to address the following questions. What are the overall trends in the development, testing and deployment of direct descent anti satellite weapons? What types of platforms have been used and what has been the impact of past tests on the space environment and on the space based activities of third parties? I've been given a time restraint for my remarks, which is probably for the best because I can talk a very long time in this issue if allowed. For a longer analysis of Earth to space threats and other types of counter space capabilities, please visit Secure World Foundation's website for our document, which is freely available to all titled. Global counter space capabilities and Open source assessment. I am very happy to report that we have the Executive Executive Summary translated into all the official UN languages English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and as of last week, Arabic. The security and the stability of space has been a concern since the beginning of the space age. It is more acute now, however, because more than 80 countries have satellites in orbit and there is a rising dependence on space capabilities for such critical needs as economic development, environmental monitoring and disaster management. Although space security has historically been perceived as relevant only to the geopolitical superpowers, nearly every person on this planet now uses space data in some way and thus benefits from a predictable space environment with reliable access to that information. Today a number of countries are developing Counter Space and anti satellite or ASAT weapons which are capable of deceiving, disrupting, denying, degrading or even destroying objects in space. The incentive to develop and potentially use those weapon systems stems from the growing roles that space capabilities play today in every modern military force, particularly those of the major nuclear powers. Disrupting an opponent's space capabilities might be considered in a military setting. But it could also lead to nuclear escalation and also create long term risk even after conflict ends. I will point out that although many countries are pursuing significant research and development programs involving a broad range of destructive and non destructive counter space capabilities, only non destructive capabilities are actively being used in current military operations. Some ASAP capabilities are destructive in nature, physically striking an object in space and causing it to break up. While no country has ever attacked another country's space object in this way, the mere testing of destructive ASAP weapons represent some of the most significant debris generating events in history that are creating problems for operational satellites today. There has been a recent uptick in destructive anti satellite weapons testing, which is concerning because, as stated, such tests can result in long debris that can harm other satellites in orbit. They can also create the precedent that ASAP weapon tests are acceptable and thus encourage more countries to conduct them. That in turn runs the risk of inadvertent escalation or even possible deliberate use of ASAP weapons during a conflict if this proliferation becomes more prevalent. During the early years of the Space Age, the only two countries to test ASAT weapons were chronologically the United States and the then Soviet Union. There was a decade long pause in these tests at the end of the Cold War, but they eventually resumed with the involvement of two more countries, China and India. The destructive ASAP weapons tests that have been held since the 1960s have created over 6300 trackable pieces of orbital debris. More than 4300 of which are still around and pose hazards to satellites. Given the altitudes of some of the debris created by these tests, they may continue to be around for years, if not decades more. The Secure World Foundation has put together an infographic. That debris created by destructive ASAP tests is available on our website, plus there are hard copies in the back. It illustrates that the sheer force of impact can spread debris out from these tasks well beyond the altitude at which the point of impact was made, at times hundreds or even 1000, plus more kilometers farther out. This is significant because the higher up the debris is, the longer it will take to deorbit, and thus the longer it can threaten other space objects, satellites, or space stations. In discussing Direct descent ASAP programs specifically, I'm referring to those systems where there is an interceptor launched from a terrestrial platform which can be ground, sea or air based and which destroys its target directly by impacting it. The ground based platforms can be fixed silos or mobile platforms. The target for direct to send ASAT tests historically have been in low Earth orbit, and even that pretty low below 880 kilometers. Although there was 1 notable exception when an interceptor was launched to what has been reported to be almost 36,000 kilometers, nearly Geo. It should be noted that it is not clear that it was actually attempting to target it. Hit a target at this case did not impact any target. Some sort of tracking capability is also needed for a direct to send ASAP capability. We often see this tracking capability emerging from indigenously produced space situation awareness or SSA systems. During the early stages of erectus and ASAP development in the 1960s, research and development programs considered using nuclear warheads on the interceptors, with the idea that they would destroy their target either via fireball or an electromagnetic pulse. Thankfully, that approach was reconsidered and thus programs shifted towards interceptors that strive to kinetically impact their targets. Direct Descent ASAP Interceptors have historically evolved from national ballistic missile capabilities and very often have been interwoven with ballistic missile defense programs. I will now briefly go over the direct to send ASAP capabilities of the four countries that have held destructive anti satellite tests, again going in chronological order. Starting with the United States. During the Cold War the United States military had multiple efforts to develop direct ascent ASAP capabilities. Some of those efforts remained on the drawing board and several were tested in space, but none reached operational status. While the United States does not currently have an operational acknowledged direct descent capability, it does have operational midcourse sea based missile defense interceptors that have been demonstrated in an anti satellite role against a low. Earth Orbit Satellite. Furthermore, it could potentially use its ground based missile defense interceptors to target satellites in low Earth orbit and possibly some satellites in highly elliptical orbits. If they have parities, they dip down to lower altitudes. The next country is Russia. Russia has long had the potential for a direct dissent anti satellite capability through its historical ballistic missile defense capabilities and had direct ascent ASAC development programs in the past that never became fully operational. The Russian director sent ASIC capabilities currently consist of three primary programs which have direct or indirect counterspace capabilities that are launched off of ground and air based platforms. All three have their roots in souvenir programs that have been revived or reconstituted in recent years. Russian Direct Descent ASAP capabilities did not appear to have the capability to reach targets beyond low Earth orbit. China. China has at least one and possibly three programs underway to develop direct descent anti satellite capabilities either as dedicated counter space systems or as midcourse missile defense systems that could provide counter space capabilities. China has engaged in multiple progressive tests of these capabilities since 2005, indicating a serious and sustained organizational effort. Chinese direct descent and anti salad capability against low Earth orbit targets is likely mature. Chinese direct descent capability against deep space targets, either in medium Earth orbit and geostationary orbit is likely still in the experimental or developmental phase, and there is not sufficient evidence to conclude whether it'll become operational in the near future. Finally, India. For many years Indian officials said that they had an inherent but untested anti satellite capability via their long range ballistic missile programs. It was in 2019 when India demonstrated via political missile defense system a direct descent ASAP capability were destroyed one of its satellites with a missile defense interceptor. This target was in low low earth orbit. So, given the overview of the current state of directness and anti satellite programs, what can be done to mitigate this threat to the space environment? Given the growing global reliance on satellite and space applications, many in the international community have begun calling for a ban or prohibition on the on the testing of destructive anti satellite weapons. As we all know, in April this year the United States became the first country to declare commitment to no longer conduct destructive Anti Salute Missile tests. This declaration was soon followed by similar ones by Canada, New Zealand and as of yesterday, Japan. SWF applauds its commitment and urges other countries, even those not destruct and not interested and destructive ASAP Weapons do the same. Doing so would send a strong signal to the national community that they are committed to the long term sustainability of space and for delegitimizing the testing of these weapons against satellites. Director sent ASAT tests have made operating a low Earth orbit dangerous for years to come. All satellite operators and crude vehicles will need to spend time, effort and fuel on avoiding collisions as the debris from these tasty orbits and gradually ranches through its atmosphere. The national community must also lay foundations to be able to verify future agreements. Space situation awareness has been a top priority for many countries and involves monitoring and characterizing activities in space. These SSA capabilities could form the foundation of a verification regime for an ASAP test ban, or truly any other agreements on irresponsible behaviors in space. Finally, I know I'm getting close to my time. I would like to end my remarks with my very warm support of this OEWG process. Simply holding these discussions is broadening awareness globally about the complicated structure of space security and the ways in which the multilateral process can shore it up. The content of these discussions is illuminating too, reflecting a spectrum responses in terms of what activities countries perceive to be destabilizing in space, what they deem to be responsible behavior to be how those involved in space should be held accountable for their actions. Whether the international community comes a total agreement on this is helpful from a transparency perspective to have these beliefs spelled out, made public. It is likely after these sessions are over and is my hope there will be broad concurrence, at least some norms, responsible space behavior. There is nothing preventing countries from taking what they have learned and found useful in these group discussions and incorporating the unilateral and their space activities. In addition, these norms could become the foundation of future UN efforts and eventually, if widely disseminated, it could lead to legally binding agreements. This group may not be able to resolve all security concerns about space because no single solution or approach can do that. But it could make progress, and I hope it will make progress on some of the most pressing challenges helping space to make, helping to make space safer, more stable and predictable for all. Thank you to the chair and the distinguished delegates for your attention. I look forward to my fellow panelists remarks into questions from the audience to delve deeper in the topic of Earth to space threats. Thank you very much.",0
S2M34,2,3,Unidir,"Leticia Cesari. Mercy, Monsieur. Thank you very much, Sir. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues. It's a great privilege for me to address you, and I'm grateful for your kind invitation. I am Leticia Cesarizaka. I'm a space security researcher for Unidere. My job involves dealing in this panel with the subject of current and future threats from Earth to space. By states to space systems I will focus on. Non kinetic threats, particularly electromagnetic, cyber and non kinetic interferences. First of all I'll look at the impact which these. Intentional non kinetic interferences may have on space systems and their operations. Then I look at the main challenges in attributing these interferences and finally. I will be looking at areas for consideration on how we can mitigate these interferences. To give you a bit of perspective on deliberate non kinetic interferences and space security, I'll ask the following question. What is harmful interference? Well, it damages the direct target, deteriorates its use and it's also that which potentially can cause collateral damage to other objects or systems. Beyond the initial target and finally. It may be harmful to the operator and the target and all victims, whether or not they were directly targeted by such interference. Harmful interference isn't explicitly banned under the 1967 Space Treaty, which only in Article 9 provides for the obligation for states to undertake. Appropriate international consultations before undertaking any activity or experiment which might cause interference. Or harmful interference with the activities of other states Parties to the Treaty. Other states may also require request consultations if they have reason to believe that an activity or experiment in outer space under consideration by another state might hamper the activities conducted in the field of peaceful exploration and use of outer space. Whether before or during the space activity. The space treaty doesn't define what to Harvard interference is, but. The ITU defines this concept both in number 1169 of the Regulation on Radio communications and in .11000 and three of its constitution. It constitutes interference which compromises the operations of a radio navigation service or other security services, or which seriously degrades, hampers or interrupts in a repeated way a radio communication service operating in conformity with the regulations. As reported in our working paper, Threats to the Security of Space Activities and Systems, introduced yesterday afternoon. By my colleague Amelina Ascarate Ortega. Whereas the different the definition from the ITU is focused on disturbing radio frequency signals, the reference in the space tree to the same concept is often considered as being broader, not just limited to jamming. But rather to the creation of a situation after which harm is caused to space systems or the services provided by them. Thus, harmful interference as defined in the Space treaty is closely linked to the duty of states to pay due regard to others space activities. This concept of due regard was introduced by a professor, Setsuko Aoki, the first session of this group. Last. Some states therefore use the expression of harmful interference in this broad sense to under score the threat constituted by non kinetic counter space activity technologies currently because of the importance of the object located outside the atmosphere, the interruption of a space system, particularly when deliberately caused by electromagnetic, cyber or non kinetic physical interference. May have serious consequences and. But at risk vital civilian, economic and military functions which societies depend on, particularly in the humanitarian, financial and trade sectors. Now, why highlight this type of interference? Well, first of all, because the interconnection of space systems with land infrastructure. Will be increasing rapidly and continually. There may be breakdowns in in service at a large scale with negative consequences going well beyond the land territories of a country and then because of the speed with which new technologies are being developed. When used with ill intent, space operators not only need the appropriate defence available, but they also need to be able to identify the most vulnerable points of their systems, to protect them and to deploy robust systems which can be brought back into function as soon as possible. These security measures to reduce threats and to handle these interferences require major investment on the part of space operators. Now there are three types of deliberate interference with space systems which we're going to look at electromagnetic, cyber and physical non kinetic interferences. The first are interferences with radio communications caused by the creation of noise in the same frequency bands. This type of technology can target the electromagnetic spectrum used by space systems to transmit and receive data and provoke harmful interference. These jamming technologies generate noise in the same frequency band as a space system in order to block or interfere with the signal between Earth and the satellite, the uplink, or in the reverse direction. Downlink spoofing is used to make the system believe in a false signal produced by an assailant, which allows. The assailant to sneak false information into the system. Including false data or instructions to the control system, which may upset the operations or ensure that one of the components of a space system will act differently from what it's supposed to do. Interference is using these technologies are generally reversible, but difficult to attribute. We need to note that navigation satellites have been seen to be particularly vulnerable to jamming. This type of navigation technology can be considered as the prime target for interference because it's essential to certain military and economic activities, particularly for shipping, air or land transport, and for the synchronization and time synchronization with various equipments or infrastructures, the second type of. Deliberate interference emerged because of the important role played by information systems and the inclusion of cyber technologies on board satellites and space networks. Furthermore, now that onboard equipment both on land, at sea and in the years are remotely connected to networks used for military purposes, cyberspace has become a theater which gives it an underlying military nature. These technologies may target the data themselves. And the systems utilizing the data they can transmit which you use the data transmit and control the flow of data. Cyber interference may target satellites and land based stations as well as the components of a network linking up to the final user. Now this type of interference can be generally reversed, but nevertheless it can have a major radius of impact with the potential to harm critical infrastructure. Interference targeting the control and command system of a satellite could make it. Irreversibly inoperative. Because an assailant could cause a definitive breakdown of maneuverability of the satellite. Similarly, if the onboard technologies or sensors are harmed, space activities can be totally compromised. In generally, cyber interference doesn't require major resources and it's very difficult to predict, detect, and attribute. The feature of the third type of deliberate interference, physical non kinetic, is that its effect on satellites is material and concrete with no direct contact being made. We hear here looking at lasers, high power microwaves and EMP. These technologies may blind and dazzle sensors or harm electrical circuits and processes in satellites. Physical non kinetic interference operates at the speed of light and in some cases may be less visible to 3rd party observers and also more difficult to attribute. Within the context of space security, it's important to deal with this subject thus. Deliberate interference which compromises confidentiality, integrity or availability of data, transiting through satellite, which might interfere with telemetrics, remote and onboard controls of space systems, or which damage electronic components may be a major problem. Any breakdown in the service provided by the payloads on a space object. Or affecting its maneuverability beyond the atmosphere may call into question operations and the very reason for the existence of the space system, with no certainty that you can resolve the problem remotely. In this case, the space space system might become inoperative and thus will possibly in far too early become a part of the space debris. If we're looking at a single object, the risk of collision will be will be low, whereas. If the system is a constellation consisting of a whole host of low earth orbit objects, the stakes are totally different and the sustainability of space activities can be affected. The other problems related to non kinetic interferences are how to identify and locate their sources to attribute them. Attribution is the process of identifying the source which is responsible for an incident caused to a system by a deliberate, harmful interference, and requires that you determine the geographical origin and who is responsible for it. Two major challenges. They're both distinct but closely linked. Technical and legal The technical challenge means you have to analyze the technical aspects of interference, which may include locating the source of energy for the jamming, the malware signature, the procedures used, and analysis of network traffic. The legal challenge is. Refers to the international responsibility of a state based on its own activities or those of related non governmental entities which interfere with certain space activities or systems, whoever is engaged in such. Activities. Depending on the type of player, deciding who is really behind the interference may be more or less obvious, whereas identifying state organs seems less difficult. But those of non state actors or entities which in fact are become agents of states may be arbitrary. The same can be said for entities which are controlled or directed effectively by a state. For these negative this harmful interferences targeting space systems, drawing hasty consequences and conclusions might be. May constitute many risks for Interstate relations. Reducing deliberate interference and limiting their impact and scope depends on mainly on state initiatives at the national level. States have the possibility of adopting laws and policies to deal with the ill intention behaviour and encourage operators, private operators to establish safety and security measures which work. Properly to reduce and mitigate harmful interference. There are certain national regulations in some States and I invite you to look at the tools we've made available in Unity, such as our Cyber Policy Gateway, as well as the future Space Security Portal which will soon be operational within the international community. States could work together in order to improve the effectiveness of transparency and confidence building measures, particularly meeting at the regional level as was the case this year. In the context of events organized by the Republic of Korea. And you will find you will find a report of that on our websites and more recently we have the case of the Republic of Chile. More Furthermore, states could agree to establish common definitions. This type of undertaking could in particular be facilitated by the space security lexicon, which we'll be introducing in the very near future. Finally, I have now given you the main. Impacts. The most worrying impacts which we may find from electromagnetic, cyber and physical non kinetic interferences to operations of satellites and space objects. And then I've given you some of the challenges related to attributing them and some ideas of how to mitigate the negative impacts of such interference. On these particular points your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. It is important for there to be a more in depth discussion in the future because what's at stake is the very success of this enormous undertaking, which is to reduce. Space threats through Standards, rules and principles for Responsible Behaviour. The particular nature of outer space activities means that states need to seek to work together and to cooperate for security and safety of each and every one of us. In the long run, this will help to ensure sustainability of such activities and you can be certain. Ladies and gentlemen, representatives, that within UNIDIRE you will find the expertise, reliability and the necessary readiness to ensure that discussions proceed smoothly each and every time you need us. Thank you.",0
S2M36,2,3,Chile,"Thank you very much. It's an honor for me to be with you today. Distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, to be able to discuss space security. I've been asked to answer the question what are the measures available for states with space, new space programs, and expanding programs to detect and respond to threats from states coming from Earth, including as a result of possible collateral damage caused by action. Between other States and is it feasible to develop resilience against such threats? Delegates. Let me begin by thanking you for this valuable opportunity to speak in our official language, Spanish. And to represent the women of Latin America. Who work in space affairs and take the floor from the South of the planet from Chile, to discuss such relevant themes of global security. The development of space programs since the outset has sought to promote and accelerate cycles of technological innovation and create new challenges, risks and threats to global security owing to three major phenomena the concentration of new technologies, the duality of new technologies, the high dependence of civil society on those new. Space based technologies associated with meta, geopolitical, existing competencies in these themes that are concerned with outer space security issues. As you know, exponential growth during the 1990s. Of space based services led to the development of the fourth industrial revolution, the communications revolution. Reducing barriers to investment in technology as a result of a reduction in the hypothesis of global conflict led to increasing dependence of whole regions on such services. So even though the main space programs are concentrated in specific geographic zones. The users are spread around the world. Regardless of whether their states possess or not. Autonomy In the field of space exploration, this means that the majority of the planets population that relies on the services and benefits of outer space activity. Is not represented by a national space program. Those states. For the majority of them are not developing outer space weapons. Growing on international uncertainty, volatility and the resurgence of Interstate conflict. Means that it's impossible for the hypothesis of conflict. To currently extend to the outer space sphere. We're Speaking of the potential of billions of citizens. Members of civil society at global level. Being affected by the development and evolution of conflict in outer space. That panorama is all the more dense if we note that the total population. With the majority being located in developing countries. With in countries which often have only either nascent spatial programs or programs that are still on the drawing board. For autonomous development of space capacities. Involves developing. Long term investments and programs this requires. Structural conditions for investment in order to frame such issues within the public agenda of States, in so doing nascent space programs, particularly in developing countries. Especially in regions such as Latin America. Have a special requirement they need secure operational environments. Due to the social and political cost of such programs are greater. Owing to the structural conditions of the states in which they originate. Now what does that mean? It means that a lack of capacities, chiefly of a single satellite. Platform. Can lead to the end of the program under the future of the space capacities of those countries impacting on their invasion cycles and on development and the on the generation over time of autonomous capacities developing outer space armaments, especially those. With the capacity to destroy, raise operational costs. They seek a secure, resilient environment. With as little risk as possible for new actors, the outbreak of Interstate conflict in orbit, which today is a possibility, particularly in low Earth orbit, is consolidating new barriers to investment. Not so much to do with the application without the space applications, but in so much as those aims that the 1967 Treaty sought to enshrine, which is development associated with outer space affairs, issues that result in economic growth, knowledge and in comprehensive human development. When we look at the participation of new outer space actors, it's a common trend to see that their first steps tend to be at the level of capacities in policy and in space diplomacy. Now an example here is Latin America. Our region became a part of Kopos and after more than four decades recently started to note development of autonomous technological. Capacities. And starting in 2010, space programs where it started to benefit from transfer of technology and international cooperation mechanisms. So those the tools, in other words that the international community has for such matters. In so doing with increasing international volatility. Has undermined the OR jeopardized the ability of new actors to be able to access such technologies. Not for the technologies themselves, but rather what they mean for the development of their own national capacities. It's specifically cooperation, which is the main measure that countries with nascent space programs have to detect and respond. The threat And therefore it's through cooperation. The new challenges and risks emanating from the development of space programs can be transformed into a good initiative so that the developing countries can. Have the adequate situational awareness to operate safely. Generally speaking, new space actors aren't consolidated as. Strategic targets of a potential Interstate conflict in outer space. Because their outer space capacities are still only emerging, they have little strategic weight when it comes to space. Dominion but what is but they're but in the case of an incident, there is a risk of them being affected as collateral. Damage which would affect the operational environment in which they operate, in so doing. Developing cooperatively monitoring capacities follow up and space intelligence would allow states to operate with an adequate situational awareness level, since these are essentially *********** capacities which begin on the basis of knowledge sharing. Mutual transparency and confidence building measures between. The main countries with offensive capacities and the international community. Undoubtedly, it is now is the time to reflect over the need for multilateralism to generate forum for it in that field, geared towards operational stability and security in the space environment. With respect to resilience. The second major priority here, emerging space systems, should be capable of providing resilience, both in the terms of design and information they produce. This is part of the prerogative of each state. But this objective, like any other element of panification required, needs to be properly fueled by adequate information in form and time. Overcoming the weaknesses of vulnerable space systems due to the number of space platforms they have requires proper design of public policy in the sphere of space affairs identifying critical components. Crucial space infrastructure, the value of information and appropriate capacities for outer space situational awareness. This would at least guarantee knowing a priori the risks of the operational environment. Their connection with the phenomena of international system and would allow States to give due thought to the potential damage that could be caused to civil society and to the state itself when it comes to the disruption, denial or disintegration of their own outer space systems. This element of identifying critical infrastructure is necessary to be able to further international discussions on extending the concept of international accountability that is able to weigh up the damage to civil society with respect to disruptions or collateral damage caused by a weapons system used in orbit. It's not the same losing. A satellite. One satellite. One out of 200, or if it's the only satellite you have that provides geospatial information to a whole population, it's a different level of damage. Furthermore, resilience is a characteristic which is a prerequisite for a collaborative environment. The most response robust systems respond to an ecosystem of cooperation. Therefore, international cooperation is the great shining light when it comes to how to bolster resilience, to avoid damage to human life, to everyday processes. And in so doing, protect the freedom of every human being. So that they can benefit from the goods and services, from the knowledge and innovations stemming from outer space activities finally. We are in a profound moment of change politically and with time of new potentials and possibilities for humanity these. This should force us to visualize the future based on security and stability of the international system, which has now expanded towards outer space, outer space. Outer space security is not just the preserve of a few it's the responsibility of all humanity. And through these forums such for such as these, we are called on to build a secure, resilient future that allows current and future generations to continue learning and evolving based on our next great adventure as humanity into outer space. In conclusion, international cooperation and the return to a scenario of stability and international certainty should go hand in hand with modernizing codification of international public law and space affairs regulating. New weapon systems and generating new measures of international accountability that enable new outer space actors to observe better conditions in their development, since these are vulnerable to change to the risk, but also. Because. Developing populations around the world. Depend on them going forward. Thank you.",4
S2M38,2,3,Russia,"Thank you very much. Chairman First of all, let me thank all the panelists. For their reports. Our delegation listened with interest to them. Men and much of what is in those reports. Gives us pause for thought. Now we'd like to ask a few few questions to the distinguished panelists. Much was said about. The problems of ASAP weapons. Specifically, there was a major focus placed on 8 test ASAP weapon tests. So we have a question to all the panelists. We'd like to be good to get the opinion of all the panelists in that respect. Now the prohibition. Only on ASAP weapon tests? Offensive esat weapon tests? To what extent would it? Help prevent the use of such weaponry. In current circumstances, in view of the current situation. Secondly. Much was also said about Article 9 of the Outer Space Agreement. On activating A consultational mechanism. That is highlighted in that Treaty as a framework. In that respect, we have a question to all the panelists. To what extent would that consultative mechanism provided for in the Outer Space Treaty? Is it effective? In current circumstances. And to what extent does that mechanism? To what extent is it? Is it able to effectively resolve? Conflict. Dispute situations that might emerge. Between outer space states, spacefaring nations. And my third question. We spoke now about threats. Stemming from the ground, from ground, from Earth to space threat. But we would like to know the opinion of the panelists, distinguished panelists, To what extent? Do selective measures with respect to purely. Certain aspects linked to counteracting threats or risks emerging from. Earth to space. To what extent will they be effective in the context of meeting the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space? Without the adoption of any measures. To neutralize threats from space to Earth. Or threats. Affecting. All Earth to space. Earth to Earth, Space to Earth, Earth to space. We'd like to know your opinion on that. Thank you.",4
S2M310,2,3,The Secure World Foundation,"You get for the interesting question, I'll be responding to questions one and three. I believe that my colleague Latisha probably better for #2. So the first question focusing on offensive ASAP weapon test, how does that prevent the usage of such weapons? I mean the first response I would have to that is so far we have not seen any country use a direct descent ASAP capability against another countries. So right now this is a theoretical threat, but what we are what we have definitely seen is the destruction. Of satellite strain testing. Which has created debris which has threatened other countries Satellites From our most recent tests that was held November 2021. That created 1500 pieces of trackable debris which is now threatened every single remote sensing satellite in low Earth orbit. These have called what's known as construction. Known as squalls, where there's a bunch of possible what they call conjunctions or close approaches from the degree created from this test to active satellites. So this is a threat that we're seeing right now. It is not a theoretical threat. And so I think when we're talking about solutions to things that affect the security and stability of space and things that affect the ability for us to get the benefits and space over the long term, we look at things that are actively happening now. And that's one of them. The next question about selective measures, I don't want to go too deep into that because I know Thursdays discussion is talking about space to ground, but I will say again, when we're looking at trying to solve the problem of space security and stability, we need to look at what is actually happening. As of right now, no countries are investigating space based missile defense interceptors. This is not being done. We are giving up an actual solution if we focus on that only for a threat that does not exist. And we're actually giving out the possibility of solving a problem in a threat that does exist. It is to say debris that's created from other tests. Now that does not mean there aren't other concerns about space to space. I think Thursday's panel will be discussing uncoordinated close approaches. And one of the things my organization has been promoting is the idea for an incidence of C But incidents in space agreement where countries agree towards how military satellites will do close approaches, understandings of that nature. But I think that's something that really look at. And so I would urge this committee in this group to think about what other threats we're actually seeing as opposed to very theoretical ones that have no, that have not been seen in the future. Thank you very much.",0
S2M312,2,3,Chile,"Thank you. I'll refer generally to the three questions. Agreeing with Madame Sampson. On better focusing on. Threats that already exist. I think it's necessary not to leave space. We shouldn't ignore the potential of new threats that become. A kind of vicious cycle. It's on. It's something we should address. In terms of. How? Threats from space could be addressed. It always depends on the good faith of states in delivering on what they've agreed to. The principle which brings us together here and which honors us as a multilateral organization. In times of uncertainty and change. Good faith should always be our guiding light, but confidence is can't just be built on good wish but good wishes, but through mutual TCBMS, through transparency, in fostering dialogue, knowledge sharing, as I said. This is a duty that should be reflected in multilateral organizations. Where State Member States feel sufficient confidence to be able to continue sharing knowledge on possible development, potential developments, existing or future developments. That involve issues of operational security, for example. Now on a consultation mechanism that the distinguished delegate of Russia referred to Article 9. It's rather difficult. To speak of consultations on the potential threat when we need evidence, as in the case of development of activities that might provoke harm in the outer space level subsequent damage. Could be intense. The idea is. Just have consultations. Before such. An incident would take place. It wouldn't. So this is this quite intensified cooperation and transparency measures. That's what the measures we have through the international system as states to interact with each other and generate stability in the system. Finally, on the potential of complying with. The potential of new threats. I come back to the same point. It all comes down to confidence, trust. Now, well, there isn't uncertainty if we let growing this confidence happen or and we let it undermine cooperation and. We're not going to be able to stop any new arms race, rather there's going to be increased operational risks. Will affect all. My country has been. Looking at collateral. The idea of collateral damage. That could be done to populations and often that damage could be irreversible. So this is a good moment for us and I urge the. Room to think about, you know, is the need for a spirit of cooperation that we need, that we've had over many years in what is a very complex situation, and the need to achieve international consensus, consensus with the ultimate goal to ensure the enjoyment of the benefits of outer space for exploration, for all humanity and for human development as a whole. Therefore, in this new era, in this new era, space era of humanity, those are the principles that need to continue to guide us to ensure that development be. Intensive in intensive, but also to enable us to enjoy as much development as possible, so to have a secure environment because stability will help us to increase our level of security. Thank you.",2
S2M314,2,3,Unidir,"Thank you and I'm grateful to the Russian Federation for their questions. I will echo what my colleagues have said and add that. Whereas scientific research can provide some responses, it's only international dialogue and cooperation among states which can mitigate the risks you referred to. Discussions around the Space Treaty depend also on how these provisions are interpreted by states parties. For example, UNIDIRE is here to support the work, any work that you do together. Procedures for which will certainly require quite a bit of time, but I'm quite sure we can arrive at success. On all the legal issues you refer to, please refer to the unidere report on standards which was published by my colleagues Madina and Jessica West. On the various types of interference in particular and the cyber domain, I would say that within the international community, what might well help discussion would be to come up with a clear. Definition of exactly what Critical, national and international. Space facilities are but also to identify the related services and this might be done at the humanitarian level and these definitions might to some extent be shared with the international community as confidence measures. We've talked about transparency, mutual trust, mutual confidence, confidence building measures and I think again the cyber level, the non kinetic interferences. It would be useful to create crisis resolution networks among the states concerned. Some states wouldn't have the necessary technical means to mitigate some of the gaps that they have in combating interference. And here again, I think the international community might have a role to play. Thank you.",2
S2M316,2,3,United Kingdom,"Mr. Chairman, thank you very much indeed once again to the panelists for a really excellent. And Rich set of presentations this morning and I also have three questions which director any of the panelists on a pickle pick and mix basis? So firstly, could the panelists elaborate on? What do you think might be driving the development, deployment and testing? Of the range of counter space capabilities that you have discussed during peacetime, so outside of a conflict situation. Second question. Is what do you see as the greatest risks of miscalculation and unintended effects of. The development, deployment and testing of such capabilities. And then thirdly, could you offer any insights into work which is being conducted in other forums or? Other discussions that could inform the work of this group when it comes to solutions and particularly bearing in mind the sort of cross cutting nature of many of these areas of technology, I'm sure we'd be keen to identify where fruitful work is is being conducted elsewhere that we could run. Thank you. Sorry, including input. The last bit was including in relation to verification, bearing in mind Victoria Sampson's comment on on that particular challenge. Thanks.",2
S2M318,2,3,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for an opportunity to ask a question this morning. I want to thank the panelists this morning for their excellent presentations. I especially appreciated the perspective by Professor Valdivia on the implications of these activities on developing nations. But I did want to ask a question in particular of Miss Sampson. You talked about the threats that we are seeing today. And as we consider ways to address these threats, we have talked about systems that can have dual purpose and in particular you talked about missile defense capabilities. You noted that the United States and many other countries have missile defense capabilities that could be used as anti satellite missiles. The United States has obviously decided that testing, which is a behavior, can be observed and is irresponsible. But beyond that, beyond the way a ground based is tested, is there a way to distinguish between missile defense? Capabilities that are ground based and ground based anti satellite weapons. Thank you.",2
S2M320,2,3,Australia,"There, and thank you to the panelists for their very interesting presentations this morning. We have some questions that are directed to all of the panelists, but in particular Miss Zarkin from Unidir. Miss Zarkin, you shed light on the concept of harmful interference found in Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty, and hopefully, as you know, a definition of harmful interference can also be found in the ITU framework, but in the absence of a definition of the principle of deregard in the Outer Space Treaty. We'd be interested in your views on whether the principle of due regard would require that states undertake activities that do not threaten freedom of access to space for other states. And how can the principle of due regard be applied to the examples that the panelists have raised with respect to Earth, to space threats? And finally, could you expand on some of the ideas that you raised towards the end of your presentation, including the need to have common lexicon? Would be interested in panelists ideas on the extent to which. Negligence or recklessness should be considered when assessing the the actions of actors in outer space. Thank you.",2
S2M322,2,3,Germany,"To thank all the speakers for their very interesting presentations, we have two questions. The first question is a bit an outlook into the future regarding our use of space and the threats. We would be interested to hear the comments or assessment of the panelists, how how for instance, the new mega consolations, other novel uses of of space will change, what are the most pressing threats generally believes that we need to take a comprehensive view. At the same time, one of the panelists indicated that. They are very pressing threats. Are in a way, areas which do not have, let's say, the same dynamic development of. Threats. So we would be interested to to to hear from you what what in a way you you think will the future threat land landscape look like. And the second question has to do with attribution, which of course is a very relevant question for any kind of arms control approach and we would be interested to hear from the panelists. What potential do you see for strengthening capabilities to attribute space threats through SSA capabilities and also? We would like to hear your, your assessment whether these will be more accessible in the future because our understanding is that at the moment these are very, very challenging capabilities with a limited distribution. But we would be interested to hear whether you see through technical development or potential to put this kind of attribution of space threats on a much broader basis. Thank you.",2
S2M324,2,3,Chile,"Direct I'd like to respond to the question from the UK. On what is furthering the development of these weapons systems that we're seeing today? Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. Now I have in outer space. The space, like C, like cyberspaces, are all. Factors and space was conceptualized as a dominion from the start for the waging of war. Now, thanks to International Forum, the willingness of international community and sovereign states. We have tried to agree that peaceful use is international community, should be the priority that the benefits of outer space exploration. Would be jeopardized, destroyed by any any war there. Nevertheless development of technologies. Both in terms of pay, in terms of influence and power is being consolidated as an area within the sphere of national power. As Naya Frodan speaks of in The Geopolitical Theory of Outer Space in his book, therefore, developing systems with such characteristics that have that replicate the phenomenon is to do with the process of searching for a differentiation of balance of powers, changing the balance of global power. And that needs to be seen through the paradigm of change that we're going through. Changes in international order, including when it comes to in space programs, can be read in such a way as that. Launching satellites is. That a satellite can be can be used for a peaceful purpose and the next day be used as a method as a application of war. Now the spaces of space based. Technologies the the sphere of communication is crucial here and now makes outer space much more attractive for non conventional actors such as non state groups. Who can make use exploit such systems to be able? To achieve their goals or cause damage. To on the basis of political motivations, or whatever their goal may be. So. Outer space is not alien to the potential of conflict and it's not alien to the dynamics of the international system. And this is what we're seeing and everything we're seeing in international system in terms of news, risks and threats and new challenges. Is reflected in the space now preventing an arms race. Could well be a good place to start a discussion, a common ground to discuss things as an international community, because that's a reality that we all face thus far. I see thus far, because we don't know how things will be in 20 years, but. A threat coming from space. Not only will it affect the owner. Of a satellite platform or it will transfer, it will become a threat at global level. We don't know yet because we haven't tested it and hopefully we'll never have to see it. But we know what the effects of a space Earth attack could be in terms of. Of the impact it could have on the everyday life. On our everyday activities in our region in Latin America, it's a growing concern. Because the theme of outer space is becoming increasingly visible with the creation of all these agencies and space programs. Many states in the region are now accessing orbit, and these are steps. That EU countries, the US, the great space powers have already taken many decades ago. But that reality of the danger of the need of an operational environment goes beyond just the issue of arms control we need to establish. Non cooperation and for an operational security environment, a resilient environment. Where the operational environment helps us to keep the costs at least consistent. This means having situational knowledge as you know which is adequate. Given that need. Which goes hand in hand with the potential of a arms race or controlling an arms race, or at least given an incentive to reach agreements. The priority is dialogue, putting on the table those issues that we share. The underpin after space cooperation and then weigh up the potential damage. And that's why we need to extend this concept of international accountability on outer space affairs, not just with respect to physical damage. That's the easiest to weigh up How much is a satellite worth? How much is the power grid of a country worth? And so on. But we need to start thinking about quantification. The value of the damage of potential of us of A, how much is it going to cost of A? Disruption. To the damage to an Internet in a developing country. That for example, in a country where the female population of a country depends so much on e-commerce and then suddenly the Internet disappears as a result of an attack. So our values as an international community is the need to preserve everyday life and the potential of the of the development of communities also outside our own region. What? And. Finally. I'd like to highlight the need to establish dialogue through multilateral mechanisms. It's a very complex time. As we all know, uncertainty at international level pushes states. To. Take actions undermine the possibility of dialogue, so we need to return to the principles of mutual trust and transparency. Within our political agenda to to find common denominators between ourselves, between the various states. And this I'm convinced, having reviewed more than one instrument of its kind, that common dominators the mutual benefit for our communities, our nations, for our civil societies, and the potential of achieving a better future for of for human development. Is crucial we can find innovative solutions to both local and global problems so that we can have a more secure, safer future for future generations. Thank you.",4
S2M326,2,3,Unidir,"Thank you very much. And I'm grateful to the UK, Australia and Germany and the US. For their questions, which I'll try to. Tackle. Sufficiently and efficiently complete way. First of all, how we can be inspired by other international initiatives. First of all, to recall that in 2021 the group of experts on promoting responsible behaviour on the part of states in cyberspace confirmed that existing and potential threats to the security of information technology and communication. Are growing concern. Similarly in the first final substantive report of the open-ended working Group on Progress. In information and telecommunications, it stressed that serious incidents related to these technologies are more frequent and sophisticated, and they are consistently evolving and diversifying. If you look at what drives the development of these tests, I think that's something you need to address to my colleague talking about kinetic tests, but my feeling is that. When you look at the issue of attribution. That's one of the. Biggest challenges facing states? In the propagation of cyber threats, the way in which they infiltrate networks, in particular space networks, and the way in which collateral damage is caused. I would say there that the collateral damage which you may find in the cyber area, as my colleague Victoria Valdivia pointed out. Such collateral damage can also occur in the space field because if you create a or several debris. This will impact the space environment as a whole. And I think that's a fairly interesting parallel to draw. Back in 2015, the group of experts proposed 3 specific norms for states in cyberspace that they should abstain from operations against critical infrastructure under a foreign jurisdiction, protect their own infrastructures and consider international cooperation in the case of. Hostile operations against the critical installation. These ideas, I think, can be of extreme interest to the space sector as well. If you now turn to the question on Article 9 of the Space Treaty in 1967. The question of international consultations, appropriate consultations, is important because. As I did mention previously, all, not all states will have the same technical capability to. Understand a breach in their system, in their architecture, to understand that some. Enterprises can be interconnected. This has occurred in the past. Obviously there's always the risk of spread of propagation when you have several constellations of satellites in low Earth orbit if this propagation effects thousands of objects. This may also bring call into question the very access to space and I think bridges need to be built in the field of cyber security and kinetics for the space domain and this is where international cooperation, as our colleague said, is essential. This is where diplomats have a role to play working together. On verification, as I said in a previous response, this is where capacity sharing notification processes. Can really be an essential and important tool. Thank you.",0
S2M328,2,3,The Secure World Foundation,"Thank you Chair, and I'd like to thank the delegates in the UK, US, Australia and Germany for their. Questions, I'll try and give them you know my best response. In regards to the question about what might be driving this development testing, you know, deployment interest in counter space capabilities. I mean I think it's a really interesting question I will point out. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that space is becoming a key part of how national economies function. It's a key part of how development is happening, It's key part in terms of capacity billing for our countries and it's a national security enabler. And so I think more countries are looking OK, well, how can we ascertain that this capability that we depend upon so heavily will be there over the long term. I will point out the security foundation, our counter space that assessment when we started doing it in 2018, we covered six countries. In 2020 we added two more countries and this year's edition 2022, we added three more for 11 countries. So in the space of five years we've doubled almost the number of countries recovered and to be honest, we probably will be adding one or two more next year. And again, I think that's an indication that a lot of countries are looking at space as a capability and how do they ensure that it's resilient and reliable and predictable. Now do I agree with everything they're doing on that? No. But I think just, you know, I think that's a factor. As well, I will point out that a lot of you know this is being done concurrently with. This very, very wonky thing to say, but infrastructure, organizational infrastructure build up a lot of these countries. The establishment of military space organizations. Russia and China created their kind of version of the space Force in 2015. Of course the United States did space Force in 2019. France and Japan did equivalence of space forces in 2019. And then we had Australia, the United Kingdom and South Korea all created military space organizations just within the past year or so. And as well we're seeing concurrent creation of either a space strategy or a space policy, something like that. So we're seeing. The evolution of military space capabilities and countries are looking at ways in which to ensure the resiliency of their strength. Now my concern of course is that divide developing counter space capabilities in an environment that is unpredictable and they're not full transparency. Countries may inadvertently create an unpredictable, threatening domain, and it actually creates the opposite what they're hoping to do in order to ensure the resiliency of their capabilities of the long term. And so let me answer that. So in terms of my greatest fear for miscalculations, I think you know the concern is that you have an invertent escalation where conflict or misunderstandings of activities in space lead to conflict or war on Earth. And that is a distinct possibility, again with miscalculations, misunderstandings or mistrust. In terms of work being done elsewhere that could possibly shore up the work that's being done here, I think there's two things. One, I know we just there was a discussion yesterday of the commercial sector and the role it can play in space security and stability. I know historically there's been an allergy to bringing in the commercial sector because they're not state actors. But I will point out that the commercial sector, the private sector is becoming the dominant in terms of numbers, the dominant actor in space. And so if you want to have truly all stakeholders involved in the solution, you need to seek out all stakeholders for the conversation. And interestingly, just over the past couple years, we've seen the commercial sector actually step up and put out norms of behavior that they think are important for the secure and stable, predictable use of space. And again, you would for me that was very unusual to see because the commercial sector has really not wanted to have any kind of impediment for its capabilities. But I think there's an understanding that with the investment, with the investment. That the private sector is doing in its space capabilities and wants to make sure that that investment is protected. And so we see these norms being created by, you know, things like the Space Safety Coalition, which is an organization of satellite operators that have basically a live document. They talk about best practices for space for satellite operators. You have the satellite industry association talking about space sustainability guidelines that they'd like to see. You have confers, which Secure World is on the Secretariat for, that's a consortium of commercial actors initially funded by DARPA. But now their DARPA money is not there anymore. And the idea is that the the consortium will come up with guidelines and regulations for on orbit servicing, active removal, close approach, the idea that they want to make sure that there's been done in a predictable manner. So I think there's a lot that can be learned from those efforts that can be applied here as well as specifically in terms of verification. There's two things. One, I know Unidire did an excellent paper a few years ago on using Space dismission awareness for verification for arms control. I'm going to encourage you all to read that, but also thank you for allowing me to do an advertisement. There's a conference coming up in two weeks. It's the Amos conference in Maui. The Amos Policy Forum looks at various aspects of issues affecting space situation awareness. I will be leading a panel on SSA for verification of arms control agreements. And so one can listen in to that conference and I would encourage everyone to. Access that online if you cannot be there in person. And regards to the question I was asked specifically by the US about dual purpose missile defense capabilities. You know how do you determine the difference between a ground based missile defense capability and a ground based anti cellular weapon. I mean a lot of it has to do. We'll look at the one example that we've seen where ground based missile defense or earth based missile defense was being used in anti satellite capacity and that was in 2008 when the United States used the Aegis based SM three against a deorbiting satellite. Now the United States announced ahead of time there was going to be doing it. So it was very transparent. From what I understand, it was a few modifications to the computer software, a little bit to the launch tubes. And so there was a lot of explanation as to what was been happening. So I mean, I think 1 answer is really the technology is very similar. Oftentimes when it comes down to is the targeting, are you targeting a satellite, you targeting bliss and missile. And so I think the United States demonstrated that, OK. The way you can demonstrate, you know what the difference is, is that you have to be able to demonstrate good intent, to demonstrate transparency, you to be sharing information about what your interest is and what your, what your capabilities trying to accomplish at that point. But a lot of it is just conjecture and I will point out we go into some depth of this in our counter space that document about how you know various midcourse missile defense programs have an anti satellite capacity. But again it's unproven a lot of times just based on the technology that we know that this could be done as a capacity, but we're not entirely sure the capability. And again that's where in general transparency, sharing information about policies above budgeting about priorities, about strategies for every country that has these sort of capabilities is very important to make sure there's not misunderstandings or mistrust. In regards to the question about how mega constellations and uses of space can affect space threats, I mean I think there's two different ways in which you can respond to that. I I would say, you know, things like a mega consolation, that's more a disruption which can be very destabilizing. It's not necessarily a threat in that we've heard discussions about a threat is something being done to deliberately harm another country or another actor in space. But I mean when you come down to it, if you have an unstable, unpredictable domain. That can be as threatening and as harmful as a deliberate approach. And so I think it's really important to be looking at, OK, well how do we improve the governance right now the when we're talking about the mega constellations and when I say it's a disruption, it is truly a disruption to how our space regime is functioning right now. I can't keep track. There's probably about 6400 active satellites, over 3000 of which are from 1 actor and that's not a national state, that's a commercial actor. It's SpaceX with their Starlink. SpaceX started launching their Starlink constellation 3 years ago. You can see there's a huge change in how the domain functions, and so when you have the primary actor being a commercial, this changes how You have discussions about space traffic management. I have discussions about spectrum allocation. I have discussions about. Launch and re-entry, how you look at discussions about end of life granted. And since SpaceX is officially AUS company, I think when it comes down to Article 6, the Outer Space Treaty, the United States is in the end responsible for the actions. But still we're talking about stakeholders being involved in conversations. It's important to say, OK, who are the primary actors, What are the standard operating procedures that they're creating and how do we ensure those are being done in a stable, predictable and sustainable manner? And so I think that's really where the disruption, the governance is that can be threatening. And again, that comes down to the idea of any new action in space. The Outer Space Treaty is a solid, solid document. It's got Gray bones, it's got great principles and we're seeing the application of that as in the United States pushes for the arguments accords, which basically pulls in the principles, the Outer Space Treaty and applies it to a new domain. But it still means that the interpretation of how these, how these apply to these new uses of space requires multilateral discussions, recent requires consultations, requires transparency. Requires acting in good faith and due regard of the fellow actors in space, and so I hope that we'll continue to see that as we see these new uses of space happen. And then finally, in terms of attribution for a potential capabilities, I mean we're talking about attribution, SSA capabilities. There's two things. You look at SSA in terms of getting technical readings, understanding what's going on in orbit, but then there's also the idea of this, understanding what that means. The technical information is only as good as you know what to do with it. If you're given information about technical activities and you don't know, hey, is this a typical, is this normal? Is this something I should be worried about? I think it's, you know, it's not very helpful and so we're talking about attribution. I think it's important to have the capacity to not only have the SSA information, but to be able to understand what those patterns and behaviors mean. And then finally, I will point out one of the things I find very encouraging is that SSA used to be solely the Providence of national actors, but there's those really strong commercial SSA sector that is putting out more information that is I think helping improve transparency and providing more points. Of more background information and more ways in which to verify what the national SSA systems are saying. And so I think it's very helpful. I think SSA essentially should be a public good and that there should be a certain level of SSA information shared just as a matter of public safety and that we are seeing being done. But I think the commercial space sector can definitely enhance this sort of capability particularly as new countries come on board and start to do new actions. So I would encourage. Using this new commercial study sector. When possible, but also ensuring that at the national level there's the capacity to understand, to input this information, the technical information and then to be able to do. Internal analysis with the patterns of behavior actually mean. Thank you very much.",0
S2M330,2,3,The Australian Center for Space Governance,"Thank you so much Chair and I appreciate the opportunity to speak as a non delegate. And I really appreciate all of the comments and information that all of the panelists have given. I'd actually like to return to two of the questions that the Russian delegate posed. The first thing, how even if we do have a ban or a norm that says testing of direct descent anti satellite weapons would be prohibited or at least irresponsible, what that might mean in terms of use of those capabilities during wartime? And in fact, I would say there might be an answer in the laws of armed conflict, which I was honored to address the delegations on at the first session of the meeting of this group, That in fact, because of the debris created by those kinetic weapons, there's a number of principles, existing norms, rules and principles in the laws of armed conflict which would apply, one of them being. The principle of proportionality, that if it's impossible to contain or even predict what happens to that debris and the impact of that debris on civilian uses of space, on neutral states, and so on. That that might be one reason why use of those weapons would be unlawful. There's another principle in the laws of armed conflict which says that any impacts on an environment by the by use of a certain means or weapons which would have a long term, severe and widespread impact on that environment would also be unlawful. And so the creation of long lasting and unpredictable debris in the space environment would be unlawful under those principles. So I think as soon as we enter a situation of armed conflict. There are existing laws which would which would prohibit the use of those weapons. If we were able to come to agreement about a prohibition, or at least an agreement that it's irresponsible to test those in peacetime, we would have a very comprehensive set of norms addressing that particular capability. But I also wanted to respond or pose a further question off the back of the Russian delegates question about selective measures. Because I think it's extremely useful that the theme of this week covers the different kinds of threats. Earth to space, space to Earth, space to space. I'm wondering if any of the panelists have a sense of what kind of measures or norms, rules and principles might be able to address all of those threats. Many of you have kept returning to the need for transparency and communication and consultation. Are there do you think, some norms that could be, I guess kind of low hanging fruits that that this working group could come to that would not necessarily be focusing on particular capabilities or particular domains? Thank you.",0
S2M332,2,3,The Secure World Foundation,"Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the Observer for our thoughtful questions. I'm not a lawyer and so, but I will point out that in regards to how the laws of foreign conflict apply in space, particularly in wartime circumstances, there is an effort called the Wilmer Manual which is attempting to put this down in terms of how these apply. It's being done by a group of international legal and space experts and it is supposed to be coming out within I think the next few months or so and I would encourage. The what they their output being used to help guides and the discussions here because I think they've been putting a lot of thought in these considerations for many years. But specifically looking at you know whether there are selective measures and that can apply to all. I mean again I feel like oftentimes we get bogged down and you know well my particular proposal is the best one. I think there are many different approaches that can be used to ensure that space is stable and secure and predictable over long term. Things like an ASAP test, moratorium is but one. But I think just because it doesn't handle every single threat doesn't mean it doesn't have benefit in terms of other more broad discussions. Secure World made the statement back in May when we talked about the initial first meeting, the open-ended working group. But the idea of transparency, you know, Things like following through and signing all the existing legal arms control treaties, you know. Looking at sharing information about not just policies and procedures, but looking at sharing information about potential close approaches, showing information about military space activities, sharing information about how to make contact when there's concerns about potential close approaches, improving the information and verification through SSA. So I think there's a whole host of those type of capabilities I think are low hanging fruit. Again, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel here. There's things have been proposed building off the 2013 Group of Governmental experts on space transparency. Comparison measures that lists a lot of these sort of discussions that a chair was very involved in. I think that we can build some of the things from that and I think it's important to get some. Forward movement and agreement here. So we can build on that and break out of the morass that we've seen for the international discussions and space security for many decades where there's been just kind of a treaty, no treaty, very binary discussion, frankly, it has not been helpful, has not produced anything. And meanwhile the space environment gets more and more complicated and more and more countries have more and more to lose. So I think if there's a benefit to getting some sort of agreement going ahead, I think as well if you read through the reports, the, the inputs. Countries gave to the UN Secretary General under UN General Assembly Resolution 7536. You see kind of a gelling of sorts of concerns that countries have. Generally speaking, it's considered bad form. To create deliberately create long lived debris and it's considered bad form. To non cornic close approaches it's considered bad form not to act with due regard. And to deliberately harm, do harmful interference. And so I think we can start to see the agreement that we're we're coming up in those discussions that can be used as a low hanging fruit to really get the momentum going, see some forward momentum and then be able to really handle the threats of the space environment so that all actors in space and all people on this planet continue to get the benefit and security from space over the long term. Thank you very much.",2
S2M334,2,3,Unidir,"Thank you. And thank you Doctor Steer for that question and for your very interesting. Comments. Looking at measures which might make it possible for states. To guard against. The various threats on the subjects I referred to earlier, I'd stress the fact that national law which states adopt, institute and update. Is essential to guarantee their own security and National Defense. As Victoria Sampson recalled at the moment. Businesses. Commercial Enterprise. Are really present in space and such. Enterprise get licenses or permits from various countries and as that license or permit is awarded, whether it be for launch. All the very activity carried out by any given object or objects. There is a framework governing that, a framework which may also go hand in hand with conditions. And conditions in particular for onboard systems and equipment. Can be adjusted to meet the current threats which we're aware of. Maybe not to future threats, but. It is possible. What you can establish are minimal protective measures, for example in cyber defense. For equipment which you're very well aware might in the future. Come under be the target of interference. For example, radio navigation. As I said, this might be considered as a prime target. So protect protective measures need to be adequate or at least minimal to mitigate threat, which is where states have a role to play in their national legislation. Conditions are very important when granting licenses or permits. If you now look. These norms and standards. I think too often we forget the fact that equipment is more and more connected, interconnected, that within constellations they have technology which will come under threats which we're not aware of at the moment and that the law and the equipment needs to be updated, upgraded as soon as possible as often as possible. Finally, I'm delighted to give you a bit of advertising for Unidere and. To respond to the request from Australia. We are at the moment. And this follows on from the discussions we've had earlier on multilingualism, linguism and the interest in involving as many possible stakeholders as possible. In international discussion, we're developing A lexicon which makes it possible to ensure greater understanding of the various subjects dealt with in discussions on space security. For example, what is this security or what is safety? For example, due regard this concept of due regard. To other people's space activities and that sort of thing. So as I say you ended it is at the moment identifying a number of concepts terms which will then maybe be clarified, certainly with your assistance. And working together to ensure effective international cooperation. Respecting multilingualism, we remain available for any issues you care to raise with us.",2
S2M336,2,3,Chile,"Yes, I have to set off to my place of work. It's almost 7:00 AM here. In conclusion, I want to thank you for the possibility of speaking here, and I want to thank the various delegates, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen here who have been here to discuss such an important issue going forward about space operations but also global security. I want to stress that all these issues that we've been discussing, interesting though they are, have irrelevant characteristic. And that is that they are cross cutting in the room. The delegations have highlighted the importance of technical knowledge, but also the relevance of knowledge, of diplomacy, politics, space law. Because no program doesn't is not stand alone, it is understood within the priorities, objective objectives and strategies. And interests of all. Statistic interests of states. So any space development, technological development, takes place in a specific context. That context, when we speak of states, states, reflects the international system. Nothing occurs in isolation and this includes the risk perception, perception of challenges and threats. The phenomenon of the international cyst. Within the limits of our planet means gives us new dimensions and where states operate. One of these is space and another major sphere is cyberspace. The development of technologies and the nature of conflict now means that we in a multi dominion situation and therefore we need. To coordinate and the disciplinary efforts that can see and respond. To threats wherever they emerge. And this includes the sphere of information as one of the most important generation of knowledge. Has not does not have associated costs as one dear professor of mine that says it doesn't generate. And therefore, in terms of generation of knowledge, that's what all states are called on to apply, particularly the new outer space actors developing states. To assume responsibilities with each of us within our sphere of action. I think we reviewed and discussed at length the need for transparency and confidence, building on the possibility of addressing what already exists. In term, because as we move into this new cycle of innovation in the 1950s, I don't think anyone could imagine where we are that it could be so possible to speak, of offensive capabilities.: But even those capacities can put into danger the life of astronauts. Even though they may only be in space for a couple of hours, even back then we only dream of putting a man into space for a couple of hours. So in conclusion, I want to make a final appeal that I want you to bear in mind of the great need to be able to establish these TCBMS based on knowledge of domestic. Domestic outer space policy than the first regulator of a willing, of a willing of a state is it's it's bound and it first and foremost, foremost by its national laws. Therefore, achieving proper understanding of outer space activities and the specific interests and public policies of states could be shine some light on helping to reduce the potentiality of conflict. In decades to come. Multilateral organs need to create these kinds of fora. They could be a repository of the knowledge sharing when it comes to formulating public policy. These kinds of forums for these kinds of working groups need to continue because it helps. Us to better understand the problems of outer space issues to prevent errors in interpretation that could pose a threat on the one hand and. Whereas they could help offer greater opportunities for our societies. Finally, I want to thank you very much for the possibility of participating here today. For those not from developing countries, you probably might not have the same appreciation of how important is to be able to present in a meeting like this with you. The scarce issues of Outer space issues in a developing country with an emerging space program, it's. Very valuable. And as the Academy of Strategic Studies and the Military Defense of Chile believes that the first step towards a safe, resilient space activities, SSASSA is built based on knowledge. That knowledge is inspired from seeking solutions to public problems. That generated by future outer space programs. Thank you once again, Chairman, through you and through the team that has made it possible for me to participate here. And thank you to all of you present for giving me your time and attention. Thank you.",4
S2M42,2,4,Belgium,"Mr. Chair, pursue every success in your work and thank you for organizing this session. My delegation is looking forward to contribute constructively to the objectives of the OEWG. Mr. Chair, Belgium aligns itself fully to the intervention made by the EU and allow myself to take the floor for some additional points in a national capacity. Belgium stresses the importance of free access to outer space and the unhindered conduct of space activities by governments and society. As societies depend incrementally on space systems and services for growth and development. A crucial part of those space systems are in orbit space assets which are vulnerable to intentional and directed to disruptive interference. Therefore, in addition to the existing regular framework to protect these space systems, norms and standards should be developed to identify and define threatening and irresponsible behaviors that harm the functioning of critical services of space systems to society. Initiatives such as the German and Philippines Working Paper contribute to this debate by listing different threats and risk to space activities and defining irresponsible behavior. Belgium looks forward to a like input by other stakeholders in this debate. These inputs need to materialize the characterization of irresponsible behaviors in outer space, which could constitute A benchmark to work on development of a range of responsible behaviors that are instrumental for safety, security, and sustainability. A new set of norms in responsible behaviors will not only reduce threats and risks in the future, but is also a first step towards a framework to regulate space operations and increasingly congested environments. Mr. Chair, did you use nature of space assets is inherently linked to the implementation of the security agenda of space faring nations. In view of this debate, Belgium calls on all to step away from countermeasures that cause a permanent damage to space systems and outer space activities. Therefore, we support the initiative by the US not to conduct a destructive direct ascent anti satellite missile tests in the future to prevent space debris that disrupts in orbit space activities and services critical for all mankind. In this way, security related CBMS can contribute to the overall comprehension of the context for responsible behaviors in outer space by increasing the predictability and transparency of Security Council countermeasures. I thank you.",0
S2M44,2,4,Mexico,"Thank you very much, Chair, and first of all, allow me to welcome you to Geneva once again. And to say that of course we are entirely ready and willing to fully support you to make sure that the work that we're doing together is successful. My delegation echoes those who've already spoken to express our condolences to the Kingdom and the people of the United Kingdom for the loss of Queen Elizabeth the Second. She was a person of real stature in contemporary history. My delegation also wishes to thank you and Unidire and others for those for the preparation of this session, which my delegation believes is extremely important, we've seen. Special presentations from experts and discussion from States and we believe that all of this will facilitate our introduction and it will help us shape our final. Document Chair Mexico recognizes the importance and the urgency of preventing an arms race in outer space. And this is in line with our commitment to preserving outer space for exclusively peaceful uses and to ensure that we have a comprehensive disarmament under global control. My delegation believes that all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons and all that have in human and discriminate effects, should be prohibited and eliminated regardless. Of where they are. This is why we reject the placing of any kind of weapon in outer space. Given this, my delegation wishes to make some comments on. The agenda that brings us together today, the space threats and. Future possible threats to states we see with concern that current geopolitical tensions are also played out in open space, which could have serious consequences for humanity. In fact, the increasing use and dependency of outer space for national security has LED an increasing number of countries to consider their offensive and offensive capacities in space. In recent years, states have expressed interest in developing or have developed offensive and defensive capacities in order to defend space from possible attacks. They've decided to reorganize their space activities in terms of national security to better tackle the uncertainty in the threats in space. Mexico is concerned. At the possible militarization of outer space, and this is part of the security agenda of some states. This growing dependency on states. Considering. Is particularly important. And people are searching for space supremacy. And all of this means that accidents in space could actually lead to a conflict on Earth. An increasing number of States and the private sector are dedicating themselves to space activities and developing technologies. All of this, of course, has led to benefits on Earth, but it has led to greater competition in space and greater challenges for regulating these activities. Space based systems and support a large range of civil and military activities which can be vital for global economies. All nations are have an interest ensuring that space remains safe and sustainable. Mexico believes that it's important to consider that space security is indivisible, so any activities that is to the detriment of this global stability can prove to be hostile and a threat to global stability. It can be there are many different kinds of potential threats. And so we must recognize that threats don't just occur in space, and that all of this is part of a much broader system. So space must be considered when discussing any security issues. States must continue to work on CBMS and transparency in order to do away with any erroneous. Interpretations or misunderstandings and to better delineate those actions which can be considered threats. Other threats to space systems and potential risks for security could be space debris which can cause collisions, the development of anti satellite. Weapons to destroy in orbit Satellites The use of satellites to strengthen on Earth Weapons. At kinetic weapons or non kinetic attacks, for example lasers. A WITS can prevent a data collection, but not destroy satellites and all of the other issues which we saw in the presentations this morning. In this context, we remember that Article 9 of the 1967 Treaty on Outer Space establishes that States must carry out all of their activities duly bearing in mind the corresponding interests of the other states parties. Mexico reiterates that use and exploration of outer space. Muster be for the benefit and interests of all states based on principles of cooperation and mutual assistance. My country is in favour of preventing an arms race in outer space. We reject militarisation and the placing of any kind of weapons in space. Mexico believes that it's important to define a subjective concepts such as the perception of a threat. We must continue to work on transparency and confidence building measures in order to do away with wrongful interpretations and in order to better be able to characterize those actions which can be considered as threats or irresponsible behaviour. My delegation has reiterated the importance of having a legally binding international agreement which bears with the principles of verification, amongst others. And which will ensure that outer space can be preserved as a common asset, ensuring that it isn't used for war mongering and particularly preventing the placing of any weapons in space. Thank you.",4
S2M46,2,4,Egypt,"Kelly, thank you, Sir. Since this is the first time I've taken the floor, I would, on behalf of my delegation, like to extend every support to you as you conduct our work in the best possible way. We're also ready to take part in. The work of this working group. The aim being to achieve consensus. In keeping with our mandate. That said, our delegation would like to extend its most sincere condolences to the delegation of the United Kingdom on the demise of Her Majesty the Queen. The resource heritage and future to humanity. This implies common action towards developing A comprehensive, holistic approach addressing the best means to ensure proper dealing with threats targeting space systems. It is the belief of Egypt that the second session of the open-ended working group should contribute to our continued effort on all tracks, including in the UNGA First Committee as well as the corpus addressing the need of prevention of Arms race in outer space to ensure space security. Increasing threats of armed race to outer space undermines the endeavors aiming at combating and reducing potential threats to space, therefore practical measures. Should be examined and taken in in search for agreements to prevent an armed race in outer space as a priority. While Egypt stresses the paramount importance of strict compliance with the existing legal regime, providing for the peaceful use of outer space as the legal regime applicable to outer space by itself. It does not guarantee prevention of an arms brace in outer space, and there is a need to consolidate and enforce that cause. I would like to reflect on essential elements that Egypt deems essential to consider through our discussion A Wellen. El Terida while Mahotel Hailey al Mortemele. And We're looking at the risks affecting threatening space objects. Egypt considers that these threats consist in total destruction of space objects, the deliberate destruction of these objects, the use of. Energy to electronically destroy space objects as well. On these. We believe that the militarization of outer space constitutes the most serious threat we face because. We can either have demolition or destruction. Militarization is no longer the monopoly of the most developed countries. These are threats which also. Affect countries which wish to arrive in space or to become space faring nations. Which is why militarization of Outer space. Would be a grounds for Interstate conflict, constituting thus a threat to international peace. Debris also threatened the physical and material security of objects in space because the multiplication of such debris. Could cause extremely serious damage, either destroying or neutralizing. Space objects following. A collision between such objects and debris. Furthermore, navigation in outer space might endanger space objects. They might be pushed, driven 1 into the other, because outer space has no systems which regulate the passage of space objects or their movement. There. System which can show you where one particular object or another is going. So we are going to need some much more accurate systems to determine trajectories. Things which aren't available to non spacefaring countries and that's why the space powers need also to focus on the development of space based activities which are peaceful and which are of service to mankind. Objects in space may also impact with other objects. In space, secondly. Egypt would like to comment on certain activities which might be described as responsible or irresponsible and thus constituting a threat to international stability. When drawing a distinction between responsible and irresponsible behaviour or action, I believe that countries need to take account. Of due regard for international legislation, in particular security and safety in outer space, their activities need to be conducted far from any consideration related to an arms race in outer space. Further, certain acts could be referred to which have occurred in the past and which could be described as irresponsible in outer space when looking at those threats to us following such irresponsible behaviour. Such activities affect the international community in a very negative way because. They could well lead to conflict. Competition attempts to monopolize the use of outer space, and there's also the risk of a threat of A use of force. End of militarization of space, taking us far away from peaceful uses which remain our aim. Furthermore, satellites, for example, could well be endangered, and this runs counter to international law. Without wishing to go into too much detail, I would like to conclude by stating that we support the way in which you are running our work. Our delegation is grateful to Unidire, which has organized this session so nicely, and my delegation is totally prepared to take part in work to identify common denominators. And we are prepared to help us all to make progress to achieve the best possible results. Thank you.",4
S2M48,2,4,Sri Lanka,"Thank you for giving me the flow. Mr. Chair. Sri Lanka appreciates your efforts in continuing the work of the OEWG on space behavior and for the opportunity to share our views on this subject. You have our full support in moving this process forward towards the substantive outcome. We would also like to appreciate. The thought provoking presentations made. By yesterday's panelists. Security of outer space is closely linked with the security and development of modern human civilization. Due to the increased reliance on space technologies in our day-to-day activities. We faced an increased vulnerability, more importantly, a shared vulnerability. That would be hosted by any interruption to space dependent services such as civil navigation systems or mobile communication satellite systems. Therefore, the growing exploration and use of space by both state and commercial entities. Raise increasing concerns regarding possibility of weaponization and arms race in outer space. As noted by a number of states during the first session, disruptions to space systems could be on any one of the three segments that make up a space system, the ground space, or the communication link between the two. Furthermore, effective functioning of a space system could be interrupted by kinetic physical threats, non kinetic physical threats, electronic threats or by cyber threats. Thus, the unique nature of outer space and its uses should be considered in a comprehensive manner. With a we Current and future threats to space systems. The increasing number of players in outer space, including commercial actors, race a legitimate concern regarding threats posed to space systems by private entities and the issue of attribution. As per Article Six of the Outer Space Treaty states via international responsibility for national activities in outer space, whether or not such activities are by governmental agencies or by non governmental entities. It is important that this provision on international responsibility for national activities should be read in conjunction with Article One of the Treaty, which provides that exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries. However, what constitutes national activities, whether activities carried out by nationals? Of a state, activities that fall within the jurisdiction of a state, or whether the activities by the launching state. As part as per Article 7 of the Treaty, are issues that require definitional clarity, particularly given the complexity of diverse number of actors operating in space. The expansion of commercial activities and actors in outer space not only means opportunities for space technology development, but also risk for friction and conflict, particularly when there are no comprehensive binding regulations to manage them. Furthermore, states have also developed national space policies that are largely divergent from one another in connection with commercial security and civil interests. The Global Risk Report 2022, published by the World Economic Forum, identifies that gaps in space governance render arms races even more likely, and therefore the need for specific and functional multilateral agreements in an increasingly crowded and competitive outer space. Mr. Chair. Despite the advancement of space technologies and space related activities. The international legal regime relating to outer space activities remain inadequate and no international treaty on the subject has been adopted since the Moon Agreement of 1979. Military confrontations in space are now within the realm of possibility. It may be worthwhile to recall here operative paragraph two of the Paris resolution adopted in the General Assembly, which reaffirms its recognition that the existing legal regime applicable to outer space by itself does not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space. It is important to comply strictly with existing agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, and there is a need to consolidate and reinforce that regime and enhance its effectiveness. In closing Mr. Chair. While the benefit of non binding norms and transparency measures to mitigate risks in outer space is acknowledged, the importance of collective preventive action in the form of binding regulations cannot be overemphasized. From a developing country perspective, we are concerned that the longer it takes to achieve such a binding instrument on Paris. The more likely that this would eventually leave the developing states carrying the burden of sustaining a non proliferation regime in outer space, as it was in the case of nuclear weapons. This is why we continue to advocate for a preventive regime to ensure outer space is secured free of weaponization. Thank you, Chair.",4
S2M410,2,4,Sweden,"Thank you, Chair. As this is the first time a delegation takes the floor, allow me to congratulate you on the successful chairmanship. Thank all those involved in the preparations and briefly introduce myself. I am Ambassador at Lodge at the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Department for Disarmament, Non Proliferation and Arms Control. I will engage actively in aspects of outer space affairs. Including this process I look forward to work with you all as does the whole Swedish delegation Sweden aligns itself fully with the EU statement in all its aspects. Sweden regards outer space as a global common to be used for the benefit of all. We underline the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, to activities in outer space, as reflected in Article Three of the Outer Space Treaty. When developing, planning and executing space activities, states must do so in accordance with their obligations under international law. Sweden is strongly committed to strengthening International Security and stability and to the prevention of an arms race in outer space which is essential for safeguarding the long term use of the space environment for peaceful, peaceful purposes. We have supported Resolution 7536 establishing these open-ended working group and we continue to support its work and progress. Agreeing on voluntary norms of responsible behavior constitute the best way forward at this moment, without excluding the possibility of future legally binding measures. To find a common understanding against which to measure state activities will contribute to building transparency, confidence and security, and reducing threats and risks of misperceptions, miscalculations and unintended escalations of conflict. As a champion for the full, equal and meaningful participation and representation of women in all aspects of disbarment and arms control, Sweden likewise welcomes such an approach in the discussions on reducing space threats through responsible behaviours. I commend Unity and Australia Perm Rep for organizing a side event earlier today on why space security needs gender equality. Sweden also wishes to underline our welcoming of commitments made by the US and others not to conduct destructive direct descent anti satellite missile testing ASAP as a norm for responsible behaviour in outer space, thereby contributing to safety, security and long term sustainability of space activities. Mr. Chair, ahead of discussions during this session, Sweden would like to make the following initial comments. There is the need to avoid deliberate and unintentional creation of space debris. The growing number of orbital debris presents a challenge to our use of space. The risks of collisions in orbit are ever increasing, and with an increasing number of objects in orbit the margins for error are diminishing. Conflicts in space Deliberate or as a result of misunderstanding or misperception? Risks a swift deterioration of the space environment, potentially both placing vital spacecraft at risk and threaten our long term use of space. We believe that misunderstandings, misperceptions and conflict can and should be avoided, and the present working group is an important step in that direction. It is vital that we succeed if we are to keep space free for use in the long term. New technology is also changing the way we utilize space emerging services such as on orbit servicing and debris removal. Are important developments for a sustainable use of space. However, as they are dual use in the nature, it is important that we develop the right framework that can facilitate its use while still keeping perceived threats and risks risk of conflict at a minimum. Sweden believes that the following security threats and risks to space systems deserve our immediate attention. The use of kinetic force against space objects with the associated creation of space debris. Rendezvous and proximity operations that are conducted in a non transparent manner without proper communication or consent. Non kinetic actions against space systems that may damage vital functions, cause a loss of operations of a satellite, disturb or disrupt space based services or otherwise jeopardise the safety and security of people, goods or infrastructure. Mr. Chair, my delegation with experts stands ready to engage during this session and coming sessions and offer offers our full support to the important work ahead. I thank you.",0
S2M412,2,4,Algeria,"Mercy, Mr. Thank you very much, Chairman, and allow me to make this statement on behalf of the delegation of Algeria. My delegation wishes to thank you for your ongoing efforts to guide the work of the OEWG on the reduction of space threats through. And rest assured that you have our full support. In fact, our substantive work is particularly important if we think about. The implementation of resolution 76231 because it allows us to further consider. Everything. Relating to the current challenges and space security, the first session of our group allowed us to consider regulatory frameworks. And to look at threats arising from behaviors of states in outer space in the United Nations Charter, Charter, and looking at the connection with the United Nations Charter and the Outer Space Treaty. The idea being that we consolidate our common understanding. And draw an appropriate summary as a group. This is one of the possible manifestations of responsible behavior of states in order to preserve space security, that is to say, to fully respect regulatory and legal frameworks which are already in existence. And to ensure that in good faith they are strengthened and maintained. In simple terms, the areas of weakness which are identified in existing regulatory frameworks. Could be strengthened. Pursuant to the principle of. Negotiating legally by new, legally binding rules and adopting new confidence building measures and transparency measures. Of course, these will not replace a leading, legally binding instrument on the prevention of arms race in outer space. This must go hand in hand with all discussions relating to the prevention of an arms race in. Outer space and this is reflected in paragraph 80 of the recent extraordinary session of the General Assembly on disarmament, according to which new measures ought to be taken. Alongside appropriate international negotiations, and this is pursuant to the principle of the Treaty governing Estates conduct. In exploration and use of outer space. Including the Moon and other Celestial bodies, Chairman Algeria shares concerns about the growing threat of an arms race in space and its consequences for peace and security for the whole world and for our daily lives. We have to think about our. Civil and economic life which depends on it. All states must shoulder their responsibilities and must not undertake any activities which. Could hamper us achieving our common goal, which is to preserve space as an area which is free of weapons of mass destruction and of any other kind of weapons, so that everyone can benefit from space. The growing use of space requires growing transparency and more ambitious. Confidence measures. In this way, all states that have significant space capabilities have a particular responsibility to contribute to the peaceful use of space and to. Ensuring. That there is no arms race in space, and to refrain from any activities which are incompatible with this objective, and to behave pursuant to international rules, so that they can foster international cooperation and preserve space, Space and celestial bodies, are a common asset of humanities, and they must be exploited and explored in a spirit of cooperation for the benefit and for the in the in the interests of all of humanity. In all states regardless. Level of economic or scientific development. We must promote full access to technology in outer space through a cooperation, technical assistance and capacity building in developing countries. Algeria restates its commitment to all efforts to strengthen the legal regime of outer space in a common will, to ensure that we have a common future for humanity and ensure that we prevent. Any serious threats to peace and International Security? My country restates that the CD is the only. In negotiating body on disarmament and therefore has a significant role to play, it must, without any further ado, start negotiations on an international instrument relating to all of these issues. And particularly on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, my country is very attached to the principle of preventing such an arms race. And this is well reflected in its position within the CD and it's vote in favor of the different UN General Assembly resolutions aware of the importance and the urgency of preventing an arms race in outer space. My delegation is ready and willing to help carry out this objective and will spare no effort in this area. Thank you.",4
S2M414,2,4,New Zealand,"Mr. Chair, thank you for giving me the floor, the floor on the opportunity to enter into this important discussion today. As is my first time speaking at this meeting, please let me thank you and the Secretariat for the organization. We're very pleased to join our colleagues in the second session of the open-ended working group on Reducing Space Threats through norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible behaviour. New Zealand was pleased with the constructive discussions we had at the first session in May and we look forward to continuing in that vein over the next few days. Mr. Chair, our collective interest in safeguarding the sustainable, peaceful use of outer space has been well covered. I'd like to commend you and your team on the report from the first session which encapsulated the discussion and set these issues out well. Suffice to say, our modern 21st century economies rely on space infrastructure and against the backdrop of growing competition amongst space actors and growing evidence of irresponsible state behaviour, it's incumbent on us to come together to ensure this growing competition does not lead to calamitous consequences. Our job here is to develop common understandings of space threats, to avoid misunderstandings leading to heightened tensions through a perception of threat. Mr. Chair, the nature and uses of the space environment are such that we need to consider space as a system covering not just objects in space, but what the purpose of those objects are, how they provide services and interact with infrastructure on Earth, and of course how we use them. For that reason we commend the Chair for the organization of this weeks agenda, setting out a holistic approach to threats to space systems. Mr. Chair, our discussion today has focused on Earth to space threats. It's important that we consider the nature of space threats. I would like to echo the points made by other colleagues that we should not be focused exclusively on kinetic threats. Non kinetic threats, including cyber attacks on space infrastructure, jamming of signals and directed energy attacks designed to impair sensors on satellites also pose significant threats and as effects may include irreversible loss or damage to assets in space and space infrastructure on Earth. New Zealand has particular concerns around anti satellite capabilities. These capabilities can create instability between adversaries and the potential for conflict to spill over to terrestrial domains. They also threaten sustainability of outer space and the creation of space debris, introducing significant needless risk to other space based infrastructure. This threat is not not hypothetical. Over recent years we have seen a number of destructive direct descent anti satellite missile tests. New Zealand's government has been very clear. These tests represent irresponsible behaviour. For that reason we welcome the United States declaration in April this year that it will not conduct destructive direct descent anti satellite missile tests. In July, New Zealand's Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that New Zealand joined this declaration. We do not have that capability and neither are we looking to develop it. However, we see that we see this as a pragmatic first step that has the potential to reduce threats to space. We call on all countries, both those with the capabilities and those without, to make the same commitment. Mr. Chair, once again we take the opportunity to stress that the inherently dual use nature of space technology presents challenges to the development of rules, norms and standards solely focused on particular technologies or capabilities. The use of such technology for peaceful purposes should not be prohibited. Verification is a complex challenge in the space environment. As a result, focusing on norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior is the pragmatic path forward on addressing space threats, one which does not put up barriers to potentially promising new capabilities of widespread benefit, such as active debris removal or on orbit servicing. Mr. Chair, would you not rule out the negotiation of a legally binding instrument in the future? New Zealand sees this as an iterative process. Our work here on the development of norms, rules and principles will inform any future negotiation of legally binding instruments. Mr. Chair, we look forward to a productive and constructive discussion over the coming days and offer our support to you as Chair. Thank you.",0
S2M416,2,4,Cuba,"Thank you very much, Chair, and a very good afternoon to everyone. First and foremost, given that this is the first time that I'm taking the floor during this group, I wanted to congratulate you for the excellent work that you are doing. We are really very happy with it. And we very much hope that this is the way that we will always work in such an organized fashion and with such great transparency. Relating to item one, my delegation believes that the best way of tackling the issue of responsible behavior is precisely by dividing in illegally binding instruments. That clearly defines what behaviors are admissible and not admissible in international law. In our view, we have a legal framework which is applicable and which must be strengthened, and This is why my delegation supports those proposals. Stating that as soon as possible, we must negotiate a legally binding instrument for the prohibition of arms race in outer space. We understand that there are very many challenges faced by the global community, the increase in space debris saturation of resources for putting satellites in orbit amongst amongst them. We believe that this shouldn't just lead to unilateral. Declarations as part of CBMS and limited to certain practices, we believe that the best manner of CBM that can be. Achieved bearing in mind that we want a legally binding instrument is. All of those stating that the Nobody will be the first to place weapons in outer space. Cuba believes that international court. International cooperation is the best way of ensuring that a space is used for peaceful uses. We understand that there are scientific and technological benefits to these activities and that these must be made available to the whole of humanity and particularly to developing countries. We believe in everyone's right to access such a space. We believe that transfer of technology and assistance are essential pillars to bring this about and we therefore, as a result, reject any unilateral coercive measures which prevent peaceful cooperation in space. We understand that the United Nations play a key role in this area and that is why we are fully committed to the work of this group. At the same time, we understand that this group works. Together with other fora that work in this important area, each has its important mandate and we must contribute constructively to all of them. We reject any use or threat of use of. Weapons in space by any actor and we reject any possible military activity that is being developed or could potentially be developed in space, and we believe space must be for peaceful uses. We therefore believe that there already is an absolute prohibition of the use of space for military uses. We understand, Chair, that any proposal reached by this group will be a consensus proposal and that there will be a due account taken of the opinions of all countries. Just those involved in an arms race, but from all countries that are developing countries and should benefit from the development of space. I would like to thank you for the panels that you've organized and for this interactive dialogue, of course.",4
S2M418,2,4,India,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Let me begin by congratulating you on your chairing the second session of the open-ended working group. My delegation assures you of its fullest cooperation. India's views on this OEOEWG are recorded in the explanation of vote to the relevant UNGA resolutions. India is, however, participating in the proceedings of the Group substantively and constructively. The discussions in the first session of the OEWG were undeniably informative and useful. We look forward to taking part in the deliberations in the second session and assure you of our support and constructive participation. Mr. Chairman, space based capabilities are increasingly essential for the welfare of humankind. It contributes to national socio economic development through a wide area of applications, promote scientific research and technological progress and supports national self-defense endeavours. India's focus is on the use of space for welfare and not for warfare. India as opposed to the weaponization of outer space and has not resorted to any arms race in outer space. Mr. Chair, in the context of the discussions in the first session and the ongoing second session, we would like to offer some observations and thoughts. As a first step, we feel that there is a need to develop a common interpretation of existence of the exist of the existing legal framework on outer space. We feel that it's necessary to elaborate and develop understandings and certain specific provisions and terminologies, such as those contained in the Outer Space Treaty, for clarifying which activities are permitted in outer space and which are not. The discussions yesterday focused on the range of threats and security risks to space systems, including those arising from actions, activities or systems in outer space or on Earth. In this context, we feel that all outer space threats must be assessed comprehensively. Selective focus on some on some threats in comparison to others should be avoided. We feel that discussions on space security and space safety and sustainability should take place in relevant forums such as the CD and the UN. Copious mandates should be respected. Overlap should be avoided. This will avoid duplication of discussions in various fora and the creation of multiple standards on same issues. It is our preference to have a legally binding instrument because it elicits stronger guarantees of compliance and a greater commitment by states to adhere to its obligations. However, we are also open to developing a non developing, non binding outcomes such as common rules and norms, transparency and confidence building measures since they are complementary in nature and can serve as a foundation for binding agreements. We understand that there could be some merit in the pursuit of a behaviour of a behavioral approach to outer space security. Since space objects are inherently dual use in nature and since much depends on how they are used and the intent behind the usage. Subjectivity in the interpretation of space behaviors and perception of threats, how they are understood and the application of such determinations has been a matter of concern for us. It may be the case that certain space behaviors can be misinterpreted as irresponsible. Even if the intent is peaceful in nature and there is no intention to cause damage, could development of a certain space capacity in itself, without any specific activity, be seen as threatening? This is a question we have. There is a need to discuss the matter of objectivity in this and look into whether. An objective methodology based on uniform or quantifiable criteria to avoid ambiguity can be developed. We also have a we also have concerns about who will make assessments about the responsibility, or lack thereof, in respect of space activities or operations. We have concerns about verification of space behaviour using current technology and access to such technology. The means for unbiased assessment of a space behavior that are accepted and understood by all and that are immune to politicization are a related matter of concern. It is also our position that outcomes of any space security related processes, including the OEWG, should not impede the process of scientific and technological development for peaceful and legitimate purposes. In addition, it should not create new obstacles or restrictions for emerging spacefaring nations or developing nations. As well as should not affect existing international cooperating cooperation efforts. Mr. Chair, we believe that outer space should remain as an ever expanding frontier of cooperative endeavour rather than conflict. We will support international instruments aimed at maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes for all, subject to them being non discriminatory in nature, adhering to the principles of equity, being adequately verifiable and provide providing greater certainty and predictability in the outer space environment. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M420,2,4,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, and allow me to take the floor on topic two as I believe we're talking or would you like me to wait? Until later. I prefer, if you agree to to make you wait a little bit because we're we're just wrapping up with topic one. Thank you for your flexibility. And now I have a request from the distinguished representative of Indonesia. I understand it's on topic one. Can you confirm this? Mr. Chair.",2
S2M422,2,4,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor. Since this is the first time my delegation takes the floor, allow me to express our appreciation to your able stewardship in guiding the work of this open-ended working group. I also thank all the panelists for their presentations. Mr. Chair. My delegation follows closely the answering discussion on item one. As well as item 2 this morning, in our few states, adherence and obligation to relevant applicable international law, in particular 1967 autospacity are key to govern conduct of states in their activities in outer space and address the streets. The Auto Space Treaty sets out provision on exclusive and equality among all states. Non placement of weapons of mass destruction, there's possibility and liability and international cooperation, all of which are legal obligation in other in order to reduce space threats. In the scramble, the Treaty also stresses the exploration and use of outer space must be exclusively for peaceful purposes, for the benefit and interest of all countries. The interpretation of term peaceful purposes must encompass the prevention of an armrest in outer space and its weaponization. Any other interpretation would not suffice to prevent nor reduce space threats, and would be contrary to the spirit of the Treaty, Mr. Chair. Some finalists some of the panelists yesterday and this morning made the points on the importance of good faith, transparency and confidence building in guiding the conduct of state in outer space. My location share this view and also believe that there is a need of a robust transparent of outer space launching system to prevent militarization of outer space or relevant threats in space system. Making space as a new battle domain will run counter to our objective in preventing and race in outer space. In that regard, Mr. Chair, my delegation would like to underline the that the elaboration of rules, norms and principle of responsible behavior, as well as transparency and confidential bidding confidence building measures, would only be effective if they also lead or contribute to the formulation of legally banding instrument on Paris. The absence of universal, legally binding instrument of palace opens possibility of the increased risk and threats of urbanization in outer space. We also believe that such instrument will be will consolidate and reinforce the outer space regime in the context of preventing armrest and will serve as an important cornerstone in reducing space trade. In closing, Mr. Chair, we hope that the threats of the space system can be addressed in this continue to be addressed in this working group in a comprehensive manner. Thank you.",4
S2M424,2,4,Ireland,"Chair Ireland aligns with the statement of the European Union and makes the following remarks in a national capacity. My delegation would like to express its appreciation to you, Mr. Chair, for the circulation of your summary on the first meeting of the OEWG, and we look forward to engaging constructively during the course of this week. I would also like to join others in expressing my delegations. Sincere condolences to the United Kingdom on the death of Queen Elizabeth the 2nd. Chair Ireland is strongly committed to the preservation of a safe, secure and sustainable space environment. And the peaceful use of outer space on an equitable basis for all. Space systems, in particular navigation and communications satellites, are essential for the proper functioning of critical civilian infrastructure. As the ICRC has rightly pointed out, threatening or irresponsible behaviour impacting systems that support vital civilian services could cause significant humanitarian impacts as well as negative impacts on the functioning of our societies. And economies. Ireland considers that threats to space security do not only arise in space but include earth based weapons and capabilities as well as threats to ground based infrastructure and data links which societies increasing reliance on space based systems, geopolitical tensions and more precisely Interstate rivalries are playing out there. In addition, non state actors are also capable of. Threatening space based assets and systems. Most notably through cyber attacks, it is clear that space based risks are growing and will continue to grow as orbital congestion worsens. Ireland remains very concerned by the development and proliferation of anti satellite weapons, both deployed from orbit or those launched from Earth. There are particular risks associated with these weapons, including the generation of long lived debris. Apart from the possible direct effects of such ASAP activities. The development and testing of such systems are dangerous and highly destabilizing, and could lead to a deterioration of confidence between space actors. All states should refrain from launching anti satellite weapons. Ireland welcomes the commitment by some States not to conduct destructive. Direct Descent Anti Satellite Missile testing, but hopes that this will be a first step towards a more comprehensive approach within the multilateral system, resulting in legally binding rules on these weapons systems. Chair Ireland is concerned by cyber attacks, jamming and other electromagnetic interferences or Direct Energy weapons that can affect the use of space assets as well as impair services of the targeted satellite for its users and ground stations. Ireland considers such behaviour to be irresponsible as it can jeopardise the security of people and goods, indeed intentional acts of interference with space systems of another state. Or group of states should be considered as irresponsible. It is important to strengthen commitments to avoid potentially harmful interference with the peaceful exploration and use of outer space and for states to cooperate in order to facilitate equitable access to outer space. Ireland considers the destruction of space objects whether deliberate, inadvertent or negligent. As irresponsible behavior, such actions can generate long lived debris leading to damage to the space environment and represent a direct threat to further peaceful pursuits in outer space. Failure by states to limit, to the greatest extent practicable any activities in the conduct of routine space operations that generate long lived space debris is irresponsible. The list the use of any space object to destroy objects on the ground. In the air or in outer space? With consequences on safety, sustainability and security in outer space, as well as international peace, security and stability should also be considered irresponsible. Ireland is supportive of voluntary transparency and confidence building measures in outer space activities. Ireland supports increased cooperation between States regarding their space surveillance and tracking and their Space Situational Awareness service. Furthermore, Ireland regards certain actions or omissions relating to information on operations as irresponsible. Given the dual use nature of space assets. For example, conducting or knowingly supporting rendezvous operations that affect another space, another state space system, without the prior consent of that state constitutes an irresponsible behavior. The omission to inform, notify or communicate about a proximity operation that affects another state's space system is also considered an irresponsible behaviour. In addition, carrying out the uncoordinated release of objects such as subsatellites or the ejection of projectile like fragments without sufficient notice can be extremely disruptive. Chair in Closing Ireland continues to under score the importance of the OE WG conducting its work in an open and inclusive manner that integrates a gender perspective and facilitates the participation of diverse stakeholders including researchers and academics. Society, the ICRC and the commercial sector. Our discussions can benefit from the valuable technical knowledge and experience that these stakeholders bring to the table. We must work. Collectively, to make space more safe, more secure and more sustainable for all. Thank you.",0
S2M426,2,4,Saudi Arabia,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since this is the first time that my delegation speaks, we would like to congratulate you on your assumption of the Your presidency would also thank all the panelists who have taken part in these discussions. Mr. Chairman, we would like to affirm that the use of outer space should be exclusively for peaceful purposes. International conventions, relevant international conventions, prevent the weaponization. Of outer space and as this has had a positive effect on space activities, Outer space is a common heritage of mankind and for future generations, and any measures to weaponize the outer space will only threaten international peace and security. We call upon all states to take composite in building measures and to develop standards for the peaceful purposes of outer space and exploit outer space. In a sustainable manner and to prevent damage to earth stations or jamming or interference or deliberate destruction of space objects, we should also prevent collision and regulate space traffic. Thank you, Sir.",4
S2M428,2,4,ICRC,"Thank Mr. Chair for giving me the floor At the outset. I would like to express my delegation's sincere appreciation to you, Mr. Lagos, for your leadership, diligence and dedication in steering the work of this open-ended working group. I assure you of the ICRC's full support. Our gratitude also goes through the UNODA team for their tireless work in the organization of this meeting. ICICI welcomes the opportunity to participate in the discussion at the second session of the OWG. In our view, this session offers a good opportunity to examine, among others, threats that could undermine the delivery of essential civilian services and humanitarian action. I am sorry, if I may, there is a point of order requested by a Member State.",1
S2M430,2,4,Russia,Thank you very much. We're forced to take the floor in order to ask for clarification from you. Considering the framework you've set out for statements from non governmental organizations. And non state entities within this open-ended working group. Do we correctly understand that? In respect of the statement of the ICRC. We are now moving into an informal regime for our work and that this statement is being made in an informal setting. Thank you. I would recommend.,2
S2M432,2,4,Russia,"Thank you very much, Sir. Well, we again feel we need to take the floor under a point of order in the light of the clarifications you've given. We have a clear understanding in respect of the participation of non governmental Entities in the activities of this group. It clearly stated that all non governmental entities. Take part within the activities of the open-ended working group as observers. Meaning. This observer status meaning that any given non state entity, non governmental entity can be present in plenaries of the group. And submit its position. Either in writing. Or in an informal setting. If time remains for that within the working group. And that's in accordance with the General Assembly resolution. There are just. A few non state entities. In respect of which a particular special rules apply for their participation in sittings of bodies set up by the General Assembly or using the rules of procedure of the General Assembly in particular, we have the European Union I could refer to. But the ICRC? Is not. Does not come under such bodies, such entities. It does not have special status, giving it the right. To speak during plenaries of the General Assembly. Such a status was not agreed upon by us for the ICC within the context of this group. Furthermore, Mr. Chair. Yesterday, you did say. In respect of our methods of work and for the non governmental entities. We all agree with this that non government mental entities would take part in the work of the group. Solely in an informal regime. Only if time remained for that. Following the discussion held by states parties. So so. We would call upon you to abide by that format which we confirmed yesterday and which we had used in the first session and in the organizational session of the group, and we ask that you give the floor to the delegation of the ICRC solely in the non formal setting and only once all. States wishing to speak on topic to have spoken within this plenary. Thank you.",2
S2M434,2,4,Russia,"Possible. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have no objection to a statement being made by the distinguished representative of the ICRC. In an informal setting, however, we would request. That abiding by the format, the scheme, the plans we adopted, that you give the floor to the representative of the ICRC only once all States parties have spoken those who wish to under item 2, thank you.",2
S2M436,2,4,Austria,"I'll leave it to your interpretation if it is a point of order or not, but it relates to the question that was raised by the Russian Federation. To our knowledge, there is UN General Assembly resolution that makes out of the year 19190, which makes very clear the status that ICRC has. In our understanding. We are applying the rules of the General Assembly here, so we cannot really follow the argumentation of the Russian Federation by the ICRC would not benefit from this standing observer status as it has done the last 30 years. So we would request that they could have their statement as any observer. Standing observer, as we have already done so in the case of European Union in the formal setting. Thank you.",2
S2M438,2,4,Cuba,"President Thank you, Chair, for your words, but actually I'm not certain that I have a way out that would please all of us. The comment made by the distinguished relegation of Austria is quite right that the observer status of the General Assembly is different to the special status of the Holy See and the European Union. And that this is different again to the consultative Ecosoft status. These are different categories that are approved by the General Assembly using different procedures. The ICRC status is granted by the 6th Committee of the United Nations, which is the one that grants intergovernmental bodies the status observers at the UN, In practice some organizations that are not purely. Intergovernmental because of their historical. Weight and their importance, for example the International Olympic Committee, have been granted observer status at the General Assembly. Obviously, a whole different set of rules applies is applied by the General Assembly to the NGOs. Now, having clarified this legal point, I entirely agree with you that we are working on the basis of consensus in this group, not because the General Assembly says this, but because the mandate that we used to work says this. So it seems that your decision, already taken is the wisest of all. And if the ICRC whether it's immense wisdom and bent for consensus? For for wisdom, wouldn't have any problem with proceeding in the way that you've outlined. If the list of speakers has already been concluded on an issue, for example item one, then we could move to an informal setting and allow for others to make a statement that could be one way forward. Otherwise, we could also wait for all items to be dealt with and then give the. Floor to speak. But then it may be that we will have to give this organization about an hour to speak because they may wish to refer to all five items on the agenda. So I don't know what other delegations in the room believe, but I believe that once the speakers list for item one has been exhausted, I believe it will take you one second to move to an informal setting and allow one body to make a statement. I I don't believe that we have to go into such a complex issue as all the different statuses granted by the UN bodies at this stage. Thank you.",2
S2M440,2,4,Ireland,"Thank you, Chair, for us in paragraph six of the resolution establishing the open-ended working Group is very clear about this and we share fully Austria's interpretation. I thank the distinguished ambassador of Ireland for his intervention. Are there any other delegations that wish to take the floor right now? Yes, the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. Possible was. Thank you very much. First of all, we would like to confirm that we support the interpretation. Which you give on the applicability of the General Assemblies Rules of Procedure to what we're doing in this group. We need to recall the decision which we adopted that the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly apply in respect of this working group mutant. In the light, that is, of the particular features of the way in which this group operates. Namely, taking account of the applicability of the role of consensus in respect to those decisions to be taken by this group. On the decisions taken at the organizational session of the group held. In respect of the participation of non state entities. It's clearly indicated exactly how this needs to be done. In the light of the observer status, which as we've already said. Provides for the presence at sessions, but doesn't give the opportunity to speak. To take part in debates. To propose amendments or to take part in decision making. So as we see it. The proposal made by delegate of Cuba. That we not waste plenary time. Is the best we think. And is fully in keeping with the format which you set down yesterday and in the first session. Which fully derives from those decisions which we adopted at the organizational meeting. Namely. Non governmental entities. With which do not have special status. Which have observer status. Take part. In the activities of this working group in the form of statements. Solely in an informal format. And only when time remains following statements made by states parties. We are not against. The delegation of the ICRC. Making its statement under item topic one. After the list of speakers on the topic, one of States Parties has been fully run through. No problem with that. But for us it's quite clear that this must only occur in an informal format. Thank you.",2
S2M442,2,4,Austria,"Mr. Chair, I mean, we cannot really accept what you would propose, because it would be wrong in our view, in relation to the Rules of Procedure and the decision of the General Assembly, but we could take note of your decision that you want to conduct the meeting in this way, but the word accept would be highly problematic for us.",2
S2M444,2,4,ICRC,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me back the floor. I would like to reiterate that the ICS enjoys a standing invitation to participate as observer in the work of the General Assembly, and I take good note that this practice will not establish as a precedent. So I will proceed with my statement. Thank you. The ICRC welcomes the opportunity to participate in the discussion at the second session of the OEWG. In our view, this session offers a good opportunity to examine, among others, threats that could undermine the delivery of essential civilian services and humanitarian action that rely on space systems. As stated in the ICSC's working paper Working Paper #4 submitted to the first session of this group, possible threats to space systems include electronic warfare, cyber operations, directed energy attacks, as well as orbital based and ground based kinetic anti satellite weapons. Despite the long term desire and commitment of international community to explore and use space for peaceful purposes, if military operations in or in relation to other space would nevertheless be carried out as part of an armed conflict, that may cause significant harmful effects for civilians on Earth. As many delegations have underscored in their interventions, technology enabled by space systems permits most aspects of civilian life, making the potential consequences of military space operations a matter of humanitarian concern. Space systems, in particular navigation, communications and remote sensing satellites, plays an indispensable role in the functioning of civilian critical infrastructure, in particular the energy and communication sectors. These sectors enable the provision of the essential services on which civilians depend for their survival, such as food supply, water, electricity, sanitation, waste management, telecommunication and healthcare. Space systems also play an essential role in other critical civilian infrastructure, such as civilian transportation systems, banking systems, and financial markets. Degradation of any of these systems would result in significant disruption of significant sources. Mr. Chair, Humanitarian relief and emergency response supports the provision of food, water, sanitation, health care and other sectors that usually form part of critical civil infrastructure space systems, particularly whether communication, navigation and earth observing observation satellites contribute to every phase of humanitarian operation, from needs assessment to emergency relief delivery, from Disaster Risk Reduction to resilience building in protracted conflicts. Taking the ICRC as an example, we depend on space systems to conduct day-to-day humanitarian work. To start with, communication satellites are widely used for both Internet communication and vocal communication. In the ICS field operations, around 10 to 15% of the ICRC field structures and personnel rely solely on satellite communication. In places where satellite communication is the only available means of communication, civilian population affected by armed conflict also benefit from the satellite. Connectivity provided by the ICC to be able to contact their family members and loved ones. Secondly, navigation, centralized support logistics and provide low cost and accurate real time location tracking for personnel and large equipment necessary for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Today. Approximately 2600 ICRC field vehicles have installed satellite tracking equipment. Navigation satellites are also used to help victims of armed conflict to regain livelihood. For example, the ICRC is piloting a project in the Sahel region where satellites will help track livestock that we provide to the affected population so that these animals can be vaccinated. Furthermore, Earth's observation satellites offer unique information and imagery for emergency mapping, risk assessments and planning and implementation of humanitarian operations. Images might also reveal distressed agricultural conditions, impacts on water supplies, or destruction resulting from hostilities that may constitute violations of international humanitarian law. While some of these imagery could come from the air, the ICRC depends primarily on imagery derived from space systems. Mr. Chair, it is clear that the disruption or destruction of space systems serving critical infrastructure that enables the delivery of essential civil services could have wide reaching consequences for the civilian population, including humanitarian organizations. During armed conflicts, military operations, whether kinetic or non kinetic against space systems may be expected to cause direct or reverberating effects on civilians and civilian objects, including death, injury and physical damage. A space system could also be disabled, or in other words, rendered dysfunctional, without being physically damaged, for example by a cyber operation, resulting in significant disruption of civilian services. The large number of dual use systems in outer space further puts the civilian activity serviced by these systems at high risk. Furthermore, physical damage or destruction of an adversary's base objects could generate a large amount of space debris, which could in turn damage or destroy other satellites in orbit that supports safety critical and other civilian activity. Such risks are growing owing to the increased congestion in orbit, partly as a result of the increased launch of new satellites, including commercial satellites, in recent years. In this light, we wish to reiterate that should the state decide to carry out military operations in outer space, such operations would not occur in legal vacuum. They are constrained by international law, including the UN Charter, the Outer Space Treaty, IHL, and the law of neutrality. Affirming that international law, including IHL, constraints military operations in or in relation to other space during armed conflicts neither encourages the weaponization of outer space nor legitimize hostilities in outer space. It is indeed solely a matter of ensuring the protection of citizens on Earth. We urge states to consider the risk of humanitarian consequences when taking any decision with regards to mutual operations in relation to other space at national or multilateral levels. In particular, in light of the risks of significant civilian harm. States may decide to set additional general prohibitions or specific limitations with regard to weapons, hostilities or other military operations in relation to outer space, for a range of reasons. Including humanitarian ones. If new legally binding instruments or other norms, rules and principles are to be developed in this regard, they must be consistent with and should build on and strengthen the existing legal framework, including IHL. Mr. Chair, we look forward to hearing State's views on the risks of insignificant civilian harm of threats to space systems and how to address such risks. We of course, stand ready to contribute our expertise to the work of the OEWG throughout this work. Among others, my colleague Mr. Moral Vignetti will join the panel discussion this Friday to share ICICI's views on how to ensure protection of space systems that constitute critical infrastructure from cyber threats. I thank you.",0
S2M446,2,4,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for your leadership. I'd like to take this opportunity to offer my delegations deep appreciation and support for your judgement and guidance, taking this working group forward for its important mission. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank you for the opportunity to provide remarks on today's topic of Earth to space threats. The United States believes that the destructive testing of Earth to space anti satellite missiles is one of the most pressing threats facing satellites and perhaps more urgently, one of the most pressing threats facing humans in spacecraft in orbit. So we welcome the discussions today. Continue destructive direct descent anti satellite missile tests will have a direct impact on all space activities that are essential for the advancement of humanity and to the prosperity of all states. The use of outer space advances our understanding of the Earth, the universe and humankind. It creates jobs and economic opportunity. It inspires us and drives innovation around the world. Information collected from space capabilities also contributes to international peace and security, including by providing data critical to verifying compliance with arms control treaties and by alerting national leaders about evolving threats, such as the build up of military forces on a country's border. Because of this, access to and use of space is a vital interest of all states. However, the irrefutable fact is that over the last two decades we have seen a number of ground based anti satellite missile tests destroying satellites on orbit. One recent Destructive Direct Descent Anti Satellite missile test created 1785 pieces of debris that were trackable. It is likely that there were many more pieces created in this test that are too small to be tracked but still dangerous to satellites. And although the risk to satellites is important, it pales in comparison to the ramifications that debris collisions have for human Space Flight. The quote Envoys of mankind's residing in low Earth orbit are extremely vulnerable to space debris and must take major precautions to avoid collisions that likely would prove to be fatal. For example, in June 16th, 2022, the International Space Station was forced to conduct an unscheduled maneuver. To avoid a fragment from a satellite that was destroyed by a direct descent anti satellite missile, the head of the Russian space agency called the debris from this anti satellite missile test dangerous when he announced the maneuver had to be conducted. In response to the testing of these anti satellite missiles, US Vice President Kamala Harris in April of this year announced that the United States commits not to conduct destructive anti satellite missile tests. And now just last week on September 9th, she further announced that the United States intends to submit a resolution to the UN First Committee at the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly calling upon all countries to commit not to conduct destructive direct dissent anti satellite missile tests. Such tests increase the risk of miscommunication, misperception and miscalculation that could potentially lead to conflict. They are a threat to the long term sustainability of the outer space environment. And they hinder all countries ability to operate in and benefit from outer space. This resolution is our effort to multilateralize this US commitment and contribute to the work we are doing here in this important group. Paragraph 80 of the resolutions and decisions adopted by the General Assembly during its 10th Special Session devoted to disarmament states that quote, in order to prevent an arms race in outer space, further measures should be taken and appropriate negotiations held in accordance with the spirit of the Outer Space Treaty. In furtherance of that objective, the United States seeks UNGA adoption of a resolution calling upon States to commit not to conduct destructive direct dissent anti satellite missile testing. Destructive testing of these systems is reckless and irresponsible. It jeopardizes the long term sustainability of outer space and imperils the exploration and use of space by all states. The draft resolution calls for states to make voluntary commitments to refrain from conducting such tests. The precise language of the voluntary commitment that operated paragraph one of the draft resolution calls for is intended to meet the following objectives. To meaningfully limit the deliberate creation of new orbital debris beyond what is generated through normal operations, to be easily understandable without extensive new definitions and to address the greatest near term threat to space security. Importantly, the United States believes that the language in the voluntary commitment that this draft resolution calls for meets the criteria for a transparency and confidence building measure as contained in the report of the 2013 Group of Governmental Experts on TCBMS in Outer Space Activities. Those criteria are that a TCBM must, one, be clear, practical, and proven to be able to be effectively confirmed, and three, reduce or even eliminate the causes of mistrust, misunderstanding and miscalculation. The language used in this commitment and its goals are clear and proven limited to destructive tests of direct descent anti satellite missiles, which are the most pressing threat to space security. The text is easily understood and does not require the development of new definitions that have challenged efforts in the past to develop approaches to responding to anti satellite weapons. The language of this resolution. Describes activities that are effectively confirmed. Destructive testing of direct descent anti satellite missiles is likely verifiable by many countries and Commercial Services, not just by the United States. And without the need for intrusive inspections, such destructive testing would also likely be attributable. The resolution also reduces or even eliminates the cause of mistrust, misunderstanding and miscalculation. Ceasing the destructive testing of Direct Descent Anti satellite missiles would reduce tension among countries given the threat that these ASAP system pose, while at the same time reducing the risk to all countries from debris generated by these deliberate tests. We understand that for some countries this resolution may seem too limited. Such countries may worry that the commitment is not contained in a proposed legally binding treaty text. However, we believe this is an important first step we can take right now to rein in the destructive testing of direct descent anti satellite missiles, which have contributed to instability and raise the potential for conflict. We believe that ongoing work collectively in bodies like this one will make progress on developing further solutions to address other challenges resulting from state behavior that threaten the security of space systems. Moreover, history has shown that first establishing a principle as a norm through a non binding commitment can eventually lead to its inclusion and future legally binding agreements. In 1963, the UN General Assembly approved, without a vote, a resolution which solemnly called upon all states to refrain from placing in orbit around Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons. Only four years later, in 1967, similar language was enshrined in the legally binding Outer Space Treaty. The United States has long advocated for a comprehensive approach to address issues that could lead to conflict in outer space, including all issues related to the prevention of arms race in outer space. Oftentimes we hear a challenging argument that if we are working on norms, then we are not working on arms control. This is incorrect. Norms are elements of risk reduction and risk reduction is an element of arms control. the United States also recognizes that many countries do not intend to develop direct descent anti satellite missile capabilities. However, the declaratory value of such a resolution is not dependent on whether a country is developing or has developed such a capability. By making such a commitment and by backing this resolution, supporters contribute their voices to identifying this in the international community as an emerging norm of responsible behavior. Therefore, the United States believes that this draft resolution on destructive direct ascent anti satellite missile tests would enhance international peace and security and is a first step toward preventing conflict from occurring in outer space. We have already heard from a number of countries that wish to join us in making this commitment, and we hope that others will as well. We will hold consultations on this resolution on September 21st here in Geneva and again in New York during first Committee and we look forward to hearing feedback from all of you as we move forward. the United States encourages all nations to recognize that it is no one's interest to continue further destructive direct descent anti satellite missile tests. We invite all UN member States to support this United Nations General Assembly resolution and make the same commitment. Thank you so much for your time.",0
S2M448,2,4,Turkey,"Thank you, Mr. We would like to convey our gratitude to you for your titles, efforts and thank you for the summary of the first session. You can count on our delegation support in your in diverse. We would like to reiterate that Turkey attached utmost importance to protecting the right to unrestricted access to and use of other space for peaceful purposes. And there comes this OWG on releasing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors. All substantive discussions on the prevention of arms race in outer space in subsidy by the tree at the Conference of Disarmament under the Chili's coordination. We're also beneficial in sharing our opinions on reducing space threats, Mr. Chair. The space competition may harm the joint management and cooperation in space activities for peaceful purposes for the common benefit of humanity, and may cause increase international instability. It's essential to abide by the Outer Space Treaty and support international governance in space, rather than solely forcing national interests. To decrease in cooperation and transparency in outer space activities compared to previous years increases the risk of conflict. In this regard, you know later acts and initiatives, especially non transparent metal space projects should be avoided in other space. We encourage all joint efforts in achieving the goal for peaceful use of outer space. 2K remains committed to do its best in that regard, fully in line with the international law regulating outdoor space. Turkish Space Agency's mission, established in order to enhance the institutional framework in 2018, is to be a leading and pioneering institution that carries out activities serving our national interests as well as humanity, in accordance with the requirements of the new Space age. National Space Program was launched in 2021. A Nation Space Program Strategy document for 20/22/2030 was published in May 2022. There are many goals to be set in the field of space that require close international cooperation. Peaceful use of outer space is one of the principles guiding these goals under the nation's space program. Mr. Chair. While acknowledging the Auto Space Treaties importance as the cornerstone of the global governance of outer space, we would like to point out that the state agreement prohibits only placing nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in other space. It doesn't include measures against emerging terrorists such as increasing depressing debris in orbit, cyber attacks, directed energy weapons and satellite weapons. We therefore therefore. Need to work in collaboration and good faith in order to safeguard the peaceful use of space for the next generations while reducing space threats to a minimum level. Mr. Chair, we believe that within this OEWG we should prioritize identifying consensus based norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors to prevent an answerase in outer space. The continued development, testing and proliferation of anti satellite weapons exacerbate risk in outer space destructive anti satellite beside states Createspace debris and threaten peaceful outdoor space activities. We believe that the working paper submitted by Germany and the Philippines could be useful in our endeavors in that aspect. Mr. Chair. We hope that these OEWG will reach a consensus based outcome that could be a positive step for the well-being of future generations and pave the way for eventual negotiations of a legally binding instruments. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M450,2,4,Poland,"Thank you, thank you, Chair. We would like to reiterate our first commitment to the work of this group and congratulate you on the on your excellent work in such challenging environment. Poland fully aligns with the statement presented yesterday by the European Union. On national capacity, let me present my sincere condolences to the United Kingdom and its people. Let me underline some topics that are really close to our heart. First of all, the rapid technological, economic and political development of space reveals new and emerging threats, while they inherent dual use nature of many space objects and system poses challenges when it comes to protecting space assets, identifying threats and interpreting an actor's intentions. Strong formal obligations unfortunately don't do not prevent some countries from disregarding the limits unless their own citizens. We have a clearview on the nature and consequences of irresponsible behaviors. And are empowered to add their voice in shaping their own future. Threats in outer space cannot be identified from space, objects, technologies, or space. Capabilities observed in isolation, but only from a comprehensive analysis and a combination of capabilities and behaviors linked to actions, operations and activities in space, on the ground and in the cyber domain. As stated in the declaration of the High Representative of on behalf of the European Union on malicious cyber activities conducted by hackers and hackers groups in the context of Russian aggressions, again against Ukraine. Russia unprovoked and justified needery aggression, unjustified leader aggressions against Ukraine has been accompanied by the significant increase in malicious cyber activities, including by striking and concerning number of hackers and hacker groups indiscriminately targeting essential entities globally. This increase in malicious cyber activities in the context of the war against Ukraine creates unacceptable risks of spillover effects, misinterpretation and possible escalation. In this regard, we recall the EU and its Member States strong condemnation of the cyber attacks against Ukraine on 14th January 22 and the attribution on May 1022 of the Malaysian cyber activities that getting the satellite KA sat network to the Russian Federation as such malicious actions may affect.",0
S2M452,2,4,Russia,"I. Thank you, Chair. I'm forced to take the floor on a point of order within. Under Rule 71. Since. The delegate of Poland. Seems to have somewhat forgotten. Himself and thought that we weren't not in the open-ended working group discussing specific issues related to threats. And challenges. In respect of space objects and systems. But seems to believe that he's at the podium of the General Assembly. And he decided to tell us about his country's view of the special military operation in Ukraine. As we said yesterday, frequently. This subject is not under discussion in this group. It comes. It's outside our mandate. And therefore is not in keeping with Rule 68 clearly stating that. Statements should be under the agenda. And those issues which are up for discussion. So, Mr. Chair. We would request that you require the Polish delegate to keep order. And that he strictly abide by and stick to the agenda matter item which we are now discussing. And that is. 6B relating to. Current and future. Threats to space systems as well as activities. And emissions, which could be considered irresponsible. And this has nothing whatsoever to do with the special military operation conducted by the Russian Federation in Ukraine. As we said yesterday, so if such provocation continues on the part of various delegations in the room, the Russian Federation will be forced to take the floor not within the context of a right of reply. But. Within a plenary setting and to make a fully a thorough statement on the question of the special military operation. Where we will be ready to respond to the wishes of other delegations to discuss this matter. By the way we see it, this is not in the interests of this working group. So, so we request that you call for order in this room. Calling upon the Delegation of Poland to stick to business and to require that. Fully abide by item 6B in accordance with Rule 68 of the Rules Procedure of the General Assembly. Thank you.",2
S2M454,2,4,Poland,"Thank you again. I would like to finish my sentence as such malicious actions, cyber actions may affect precious assets on the orbit. We strongly condemn this unacceptable behavior and express solidarity with all countries that have been have fallen victim. We remain concerned remain concerned about the continued proliferation and testing of anti satellite weapons. In longer perspective such activity as kinetic directors sent anti satellite weapon tests seem to be particularly dangerous and highly destabilizing as potentially linked to deteriorating and the confidence between space actors increasing the perception of threats. Poland continues to urge all sides to refrain from the irresponsible behavior of distracting space objects that generate space debris in order to preserve the safe, secure and sustainable. Use of outer space for present and future generations. We appreciate the United States commitment to refrain from Director Center SAT tests and reducing the emission of uncontrolled space debris. Thank you very much, Chair.",0
S2M456,2,4,Germany,"Mr. Sheer, thank you for giving me the floor today. First of all, Germany fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union yesterday on topic one. On topic two of today's session, Current and Future Earth to Space Threats by States to Space systems, Germany would like to make the following statement in its national capacity. Mr. Chair, Germany is strongly committed to the peaceful use of outer space. Outer space must remain a safe, stable, secure and sustainable environment for the benefit of all humankind. The free and unfettered use of outer space underpins our ways of life and is essential for International Security and stability. Yet the secure use of space is under threat. We observe with great concern the development and testing of counter space capabilities, leading to increasing risks of misperception and miscalculation. One of the most pressing threats to security and sustainability of outer space. It's the testing of direct ancient anti satellite missiles by destroying own satellites in orbit. Destructive direct ancient anti satellite missile testing poses a threat to all space systems and the resulting debris, exposing astronauts and satellites of all nations to an unacceptable and avoidable risks for the year to come. This was demonstrated by Russia's test in November 2021, creating more than 1500 pieces of trackable debris. Which continue to put at risk Not only are the States satellites, but also human support, the International Space Station, for example. Germany comments of the United States of America for their commitment not to conduct such tests. And all nations who are joining this commitment in this regard. It also welcomes today's statements. Of the United States made on topic 2. Ladies and gentlemen, today I am pleased to announce that Germany commits not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti satellite missile testing. Germany invites all states to follow suit and advocates for the creation of an universal norm banning such testing. Germany fully supports and continue to support efforts within the United Nations. With the aim of reducing threats and risk affecting space systems. Conflict and confrontation in space are not inevitable. Mr. Chair, there's an urgent need to develop and to implement norms, rules and principles for responsible space behaviors to prevent misunderstanding and the risk of escalation. Germany calls on all states to conduct space activities in a peaceful. Responsible and sustainable manner and to uphold and strengthen a rule based international order for outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M458,2,4,United Kingdom,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Our delegation listened with interest this morning to the presentations on current and future Earth to space threats by States to space systems. As the excellent panelists made clear, there is a range of capabilities that currently exist to target space objects from Earth. These include direct descent, anti satellite missiles, directed energy weapons. For example, lasers. Electronic warfare, for example, jamming and spoofing. These capabilities can be used in ways that have widespread and often unpredictable effects and present risks, as we have heard, for International Security and strategic stability. Therefore, in considering how to prevent an arms race in outer space, it is vital to examine the Earth to space dimension of the problem. Let me make a Mr. Chair, let me make a few points about direct send anti satellite missiles. As pointed out by Victoria Sampson of the Secure World Foundation this morning, this capability has existed for several decades and has been tested destructively and non destructively many times by several countries. A concerning feature of this capability is that the perception of threat emerges not only from the potential use of such weapons, but also the testing of them. Given our increasing security and socioeconomic reliance on space, we believe that destructive testing of direct descent anti satellite missiles can be conclusively regarded as irresponsible. Not only is destructive testing of such missiles damaging to the space environment and therefore detrimental to the interests of all states, it could also lead to misperception and miscalculation. An affected state may not be able to distinguish between a shoot to miss test, a destructive test, or an indication the state testing the missile wished to start a conflict. We therefore, as we said yesterday, welcome the commitment made by the US and other and others to not destructively test direct ascent anti satellite missiles. This is a good example of a responsible space behavior. It addresses a real and pressing problem. It is implementable because because it is verifiable and would reduce mistrust and miscalculation. It is therefore clearly a priority area for international agreement. Mr. Chair, let me turn to directed energy weapons. These purposely focus energies such as laser particle or microwave beams to interfere with space systems. In theory, such a capability can be used at a range of power levels to deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy space objects. However, it is also worth noting that lasers have peaceful uses in tracking satellites and in communications. At the present level of technological development, the most likely use of directed energy weapons against space objects would be to temporarily dazzle or permanently blind intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites in order to conceal activities on Earth. There are several risks associated with such activity. Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites are essential for strategic stability. They are, for example, important for detecting ballistic missile launches or understanding whether preparations for such launches are being made. Dazzling or blinding a country's Intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance satellite. May cause that country to wonder whether a launch is imminent. And to prepare response options irrespective of whether a launch is planned. There is therefore a risk of miscalculation and escalation. The stakes are even higher if the missiles in question contain nuclear warheads. Space systems play a key role in ballistic missile early warning systems and can play an important role in nuclear command and control, which means space security and responsible behaviors in space have a direct role in reducing the risk of escalation. After consideration, another consideration with respect to directed energy weapons is that a country may permanently blind rather than temporarily dazzle, the sensor of an intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance satellite. The country which operates the target satellite has no way of knowing the intent of the country that is using the laser. Again, there are risks of miscalculation. Mr. Chair, let me also say a few words about the future of directed energy weapons, as the mandate of this group is to discuss both current and future threats. In future, laser is powerful enough to destroy targets at a distance may be developed. Such lasers would likely have a variety of defense uses, including to attack satellites and for ballistic missile defense and other uses. As the technology advances and the power and impact of such systems increases. There will be a need for states to talk about their usage and testing for military purposes in order to foster transparency, predictability and avoid miscalculation and uncontrolled escalation. Finally, let me make a brief point about electronic warfare, which concerns the interference with signals that flow between equipment on the ground and satellites. Electronic warfare capabilities are used for military operations. There are examples in which the use of such capabilities has affected civilian operations. As we have said, there are risks of miscalculation and escalation that can arise, and it may not always be easy to predict the extent and impact of such collateral impacts. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M460,2,4,Russia,"Thank you. Thank you very much. We would like to make a statement on this topic. Of space threats and risks. As I said yesterday. We believe that the separating out of threats and hazards in under the classification we have Earth, space, Space, Space, Space, Earth, Earth, Earth. We feel it somewhat artificial. And rather pure, purely theoretical in nature. First of all, we need to tackle the idea of what we're actually discussing. What specific space threats come under the activities of this group and require constant attention from us? As a principal space, threaten hazards may be divided up into two categories. The first is that arising during the peaceful exploration of space, for example. With this huge growth in the number of small satellites and constellations in low Earth orbit. In connection with the issue, the whole issue of space debris. Dangerous rapprochement. And other issues which we've addressed frequently both yesterday and today. The second categ. Is the space threats and hazards? Which are purely the consequence of the militarization of outer space. And here, first and foremost, we need a classification of the sources of the threat. Depending on the specifics, the nature and origin. It's our belief that the threats and risks. Dangers. Deriving from activities to explore outer space and to use it for peaceful purposes. And the related related to it need to be considered first and foremost within the United Nations Committee on Arab Space. Which does have the appropriate mandate and its universal forum for the discussion of the whole range of issues under this subject. The work. Done on these issues. Within Copperas in Vienna. Has been going on for some time. And attempts to discuss corpus issues within this group. Would only lead to duplication of the activities done in Vienna. And possible. Substituting for it. Distorting it, undermining it. Which I don't think is in our interest. Now looking at current and future threats to space systems on the part of States and also the activities act and emissions, which may be considered as irresponsible. Within this working group. Set up under the General Assembly resolutions at 7/16/31 on the subject under the first committee in the General Assembly. We're convinced that this needs to be done strictly in accordance with the decisions, the task of preventing an arms race in aerospace. Otherwise, discussion in the group might just turn aside from efforts to ensure the achievement of this key aim facing the international community by the decision of the first UN Special Session on disarmament in 78. Furthermore, this approach would be fraught with the legitimization of affirmations, to the effect that outer space is already an arena for opposition and confrontation among states. And thus. Justifying the conclusion of the possibility of deploying military systems in space. And the use of force against space based objects or using them for such force. Russia is firmly against any such direction in this open-ended working group. Agreed understandings on the threat of space activities. At the international level. As yet, has yet to be developed. Which doesn't mean that the concept hasn't been determined at the national level. That's the military doctrine of the Russian Federation. As the main external military risk or danger. Is seen as the intention to deploy weapons in outer space. As a military. In violation the functioning of the system of controlling outer space. And military risk military danger is understood a situation between Interstate or inter Interstate relations. With a whole set of factors around it. Which, under certain conditions, might lead to the outbreak or the presence of a military threat. This concept of a military threat. Is determined as inter or intrastate relations of such a nature. With the real possibility of the outbreak of a military conflict. Between opponents, opposing sides. High level of readiness for only part of any such state or group of states. Separatist or terrorist organizations? Their readiness to use military force and armed force in armed conflict. This concept requires enshrining within our group. With this, assessment of the threat and risks is applicable to outer space. The armed forces of the Random and Russian Federation in respect of outer space have been set the task in the interests of defence and security and safety of our state. Namely, to timely prevent. An air based or space based attack. To ensure readiness to repel strikes. By means from airborne or spaceborn means the deployment and maintenance in strategic space areas of orbital space equipment, ensuring the activities and operations of Russian armed forces and also the development of space based defence mechanisms. I would like to stress the activities of the Russian Federation in outer space. Do not have any confrontational intent and they are carried out in strict compliance with international law, including the Basic agreement of 1967 on space activities. This relates to all of these space activities, the Russian Federation. Including those activities in respect of which. There has been an attempt to make condemnations and assessments and to portray this unfounded analysis on the part of certain delegations. At the same time. A particular attention and reaction from the international community in the United Nations is needed for the. Various various states intentions to deploy weapons in outer space and also to boost the capacity for. Force on the part of both kinetic and non kinetic. Attacks on space objects and the use of outer space for military action. There are large scale actions to develop weapon systems intended for the use of force, or to threaten the use of force in outer space and from outer space or against space. And this back. Drop the With an idea. To make the group more effective, we need to focus its efforts on the maintenance of space for peaceful purposes and on the problem of preventing an arms race in outer space. We'd also like to look at the second part of this item on the agenda. 6B Which we're discussing. Namely. What may be considered as irresponsible behaviour in outer space, This requires some serious consideration. Many delegations have tried, to certain extent and to, with varying levels of success, success to give replies to this, but we already have that response in the 67 agreement. And it's the fundamental provision in that agreement providing for the possibility of carrying out activity in space, of activities with a purely peaceful nature. That's the criterion. Which we are seeking for in determining so-called irresponsible or responsible activities. We're looking at any action. Irresponsible action would be any action with which does not have a peaceful intent. And such actions need to be considered as irresponsible. And nothing else. Attempts on the part of some delegations to set this behavioral concept. And to come up with a multilateral, legally binding instrument with guarantees against the deployment in outer space weapons, or the use of threat or the use of force, or the threat of use of force against space based objects or with their assistance, isn't inconsistent. It doesn't hold water. And this was confirmed in the latest statement made by the Delegation of the United Kingdom. Where the distinguished British colleague. Made reference to no sort of actions whatsoever, but referred to specific types of systems and means. Namely. Anti satellite weapons. Strikes with striking capacity mean directed energy means radio, electronic equipment or jamming. And thus there's no contradiction between the behavioral approach. And there's some delegations are trying to bring up this classical. Control, arms Control, approach. We're talking about the self. Same thing. Because the very idea of a legally binding instrument to prevent an arms race in outer space. Provides. Ban not on any specific systems or means. But on specific types of activity. If you like certain types specific types of behavior. Which need to be prohibited. How we do that Well. Irrespons. We're talking about the following obligations. Namely, not to deploy in outer space, including in low Earth orbit or in heavenly bodies. Any weapons of any type. That's a ban on specific type of activity. Other forms of Irresponsible activity which require a legally binding prohibition. Include the use of force or the threat to use force. Against space objects or with their use. That too is a specific type of activity. Providing for various subtypes of other activities. Specifically, concretely, such an approach also provides for the adoption of other, more focused, detailed obligations in respect of specific types of behaviour. Namely. Not to use a space object as a means of impacting any Earth based target. Or in airspace or outer space. That too is a specific type of activity which needs a ban. Other types of activity requiring prohibition, which could be seen as. What we're calling irresponsible behaviour. As we're having a ban on the creation. Testing deployment. Of weapons in space. To carry out any. Task. Including for anti missile defense. Anti satellite system or means for the use against land based targets. Or in airspace or in the air. Or also to call for the elimination on the part of within states of such systems. That too is a call for the prevention of irresponsible behaviour. Namely, the use of already existing means. Apart from that, we also need a ban on. Such so-called irresponsible behavior. As the creation, testing, deployment. Use of space weapon. For anti missile defense. As an anti satellite means. For the use against targets on land or in the air. As. There's a whole set of prohibitions for such irresponsible activity. It's not a selective approach. Which is something which many delegations have been referring to, trying to single out just one minor aspect. And. Replace the comprehensive approach to prohibit any irresponsible activity. I'll come onto this in more detail somewhat later. Other irresponsible forms of activity which would require a ban. Where the destruction? Harming. Violation of the normal operations. Changes in trajectory. Of space objects belonging to other states. And. Finally, at least in order but not insignificance, so-called irresponsible type of activity. Going along this theoretical classification of threats and challenges, which we are now trying to discuss. I'm thinking of activities such as assisting. Or inciting other states. Or groups of states? International or Intergovernmental groups or any or any other any non governmental organizations including. Non governmental legal entities. Set up, registered, or located in the territory under the jurisdiction or control of states. So such incitement, incitement of all these entities I refer to. To take part in the activities referred to above. These so-called irresponsible activities. And it's this sort of obligation, this sort of prohibition. And not carrying out, I'm not carrying out this sort of activity which needs to be considered as a so-called responsible behaviour. In keeping with the provisions of the 67 Agreement on Outer space. The fundamental provision of that agreement to the effect that any outer space activity must be carried out purely for peaceful purposes. And therefore, we yet again call upon states. To confirm current international legal standards and principles which govern activities in outer space. And here we would draw attention to what was said by the delegation of Germany calling. For. Various issues which are not based on. Rules. We would like to warn delegations against making such statements. Distinguished delegations. We're not discussing a few. Rules taken out of international law. We want to work on the basis that we are here discussing standards, norms, principles of international law. In relation to the international legal set of legal principles on outer space in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Therefore, first and foremost, we need to talk about. Sticking to the decisions of the 1st Special Session 1978. Considering the conduct of research, exploration and use of peace of outer space for peaceful purposes. Preventing an arms race in outer space. And the launching of negotiations within the context of the 67 agreement. Unreliable guarantees for keeping space from out as keeping out of space from weapons are contained in International League documents. Resolving of issues related to the peaceful use of outer space. And ensuring safety in space activities. Have no future ahead of them. The Russian Federation. Called upon. At both national international level, to undertake obligations to fully keep space out of the arms race and to keep it for peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind. We call for the urgent beginning of the development of an international, legally binding instrument. To prevent an arms race in outer space. And to keep it for peaceful purposes. Which would prohibit. All those types of so-called irresponsible behavior. Which we've referred to just now. Now in brief. We could say that would prohibit the deployment in space of any type of weapon. And also the use of force or the threat of the use of force in space, from space or in respect of space. And that covers all of these irresponsible forms of behavior on the basis of criteria contained in the 67 agreement. And it's that which would help to eliminate the gaps and loopholes in international law. Which still exist today and which many delegations have made reference to. The basis for such a document could well be the Russia China draft agreement on the prevention of deployment of Weapons in Outer space, the use of force, or the Threat of Use of Force against Space objects. The Russian Federation wishes to achieve here in this working group. An outcome which would help To achieve the aim of preventing arms race in outer space. And the development of a multilateral, legally binding instrument. To prevent such an arms race in outer space. Containing guarantees for the prevention of the deployment of weapons in space, prevention of the use of force, or the threat of use of force against space objects or with their help. Thank you.",4
S2M462,2,4,Russia,"By Sibon. Thank you, Sir. We would like to react. To a number of statements made by delegations today. In particular the statement by the delegate of Poland. And by the delegation of Germany. We wish first of all to reject the unfounded, provocative and politicized accusations leveled at level at the Russian Federation in relation to our countries special military operation in the Ukraine. The aim of this operation? As delegations are well aware. Or IS delegations are well aware of this aim and have nothing to do with the politicized assessment? All the politicized ideas which were put before delegations, first of all by first and foremost by the delegation of Poland. As for any speculation. On the part of the delegations of both Poland and Germany in respect of the activities of the Russian Federation in outer space. Including. The testing which the Russian Federation conducts with the use of outer space or in space. Again, we must say that these statements. Are detached from reality. All of the activity of the Russian Federation in space. And any measures which the Russian Federation takes in space? Are carried out in strict accordance with international law, including the Space Treaty in 1967. And and not directed against anybody. They are purely for defensive purposes. And. We reject such speculation. Which only has one purpose behind it. To discredit the legitimate space activity conducted by the Russian Federation in accordance with the space agreement. Thank you.",2
S2M52,2,5,The Observer Research Foundation,"Thank you. Hi, good morning, Chair, members of the open-ended working group, Civil Society participants and the Secretariat. Thank you for the invitation to be part of these deliberations and the opportunity to share my thoughts on the subject of space security. Competition in space is not new. It has been on since the world's first artificial satellite was launched in 1957. But this competition has changed and intensified over the decades. Militarization of space is something we spoke about in the previous decades. It is true most militaries around the world use space for what they call passive military operations, such as the ISR, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. But today that is not the real worry. Many state parties are truly weaponized in outer space, making space extremely fragile. Integration of space into military operations has serious consequences. This is a dangerous path to pursue. Because if one state decides to pursue such a weaponization path in order to secure itself, it is going to be it is going to push others to do as well. The net result is negative for everyone for several reasons. One space is finite in nature. In a sense, the usable orbits are limited in nature. If a large number of states decide to go down this path, one is polluting space beyond the scope of usability. An already crowded and congested space is going to get even more crowded with both space objects and space debris. Which have seen an exponential increase in the past decade. As the recent US DIA report stated, the possibilities of coalitions in space has increased substantially. The report says that the possibility probability of collisions of massive derelict objects in Low Earth orbit is growing and almost certainly will continue through at least 20-30 because of rising numbers of space launches, especially those with multiple payloads, and continuing fragmentation from collisions, battery explosions and further ASAP testing events. A second point is that these actions will negatively affect the long term sustainability of space, making space inaccessible, possibly even in the medium term. With such actions, safe, secure and continued access to space is not given. Even as many satellite disruptions can occur due to the crowded nature of space, the growing geopolitical rivalry, especially in the Indo Pacific and of course beyond, has increased the likelihood of international intentional attacks carried out by states as a way of denying advantages accrued through space use. In especially during conflicts. These could manifest in a number of attacks using counter space capabilities such as cyber and electronic warfare, but in future. Use of ASAP or Co orbital systems appear to be a growing possibility, all of which makes safe, secure, and uninterrupted access to space a lot more problematic. Let me come to the my presentation now and I'll stick to the questions provided by the Secretariat and I was asked to look at the overall trends in the development, testing and development deployment of dedicated cooperative counter space systems and how they function, how they impact upon the space environment for everyone. Coorbital weapons are weapons that are placed into orbit and later maneuver to approach and attack a target satellite through different means, including in destructive and non destructive ways. Coorbital ASAT weapons are placed into the orbit. It's a stark different from the ASAP test and later manure to get into close proximity to the target satellite. These manures are also commonly known as the rendezvous proximity operations. The debris generated through these actions can remain in orbit for several decades depending on the altitude in which the ASAP weapons are used. And ASAP test in 2007 at an altitude of 800 kilometers above the Earth, created a huge debris cloud which continues to threaten satellites in nearby orbit. Still date, but we are not merely talking about things that happened 15 years ago, but there have been ASAP missile firing as late as now, but 2021 when one state targeted one of its own defense satellites. Co orbital counter space capabilities are being developed by states today because they want to deny their adversaries any advantage that may come from the use of space in military affairs. For example, if country A has made significant investments in space and is heavily reliant on space for military functions with the ability to produce outcomes in its favour, Country B or country C could see this reliance by country A as a weak spot as a vulnerability that can be exploited. In order to deny country A the benefits it may get from the use of space. This is the competitive dynamics and rivalry that is driving the development of these counter space systems. There are more than 80 active space players today, but thankfully we have only a handful of countries that have developed Co orbital systems. Countries that have made significant investment in this regard include the United States, Russia, and China. Let me talk briefly about each of these. Going by a number of authoritative reports, the United States has undertaken multiple tests of technologies for close approach, rendezvous and proximity operations. Rpos in both. And geostationary Earth orbit Geo along with tracking, targeting and intercept technologies which could be evolved into a Co orbital ASAP capability. These tests and demonstrations were carried out for non offensive functions including missile defense on orbit inspections and satellite servicing. the US does not have an acknowledged program for Co orbital ASAP capabilities but it does the process the technological wherewithal to develop Co orbitally ASAP capability in a relatively short time frame if there is a decision to develop them. The US has conducted a number of tests that caused concern. In a January 2003, the US Air Force launched for instance, the XS 10 as a secondary payload on D2 rocket. Once released, the excess IS 10 conducted a pre planned series of RPO manures near the Delta upper stage, eventually coming close to within 50 meters. In another test in April 2005, there was a subsequent year 1 Excesses 11 which was developed with the goal of exploring a range of future military applications including space servicing. Maintenance, space support and efficient space operations. According to the US Air Force, microsatellites like the XSS 11 offer reasonable platforms to test and validate key capabilities such as rendezvous, proximity operation and autonomous mission planning. Subsequently, in March 2007, US Darpa's Orbital Express mission was launched to demonstrate clause approach and rendezvous technology for satellite servicing functions with the Astro Servicing Vehicle and the Next Sat Client vehicle. This demonstrated the ability to autonomously transfer fluid to Nexat and use a robotic arm to swap out components. The two spacecraft then separated, spent and spent the next few months demonstrating multiple rendezvous and capture scenarios, including the first ever use of a robotic arm to autonomously capture another space object. This program was deactivated in 2007. Coming to the Geo, it has the US has been doing stuff since 19901990. A satellite named Prowler was secretly launched from a space shuttle mission. Based on media reports, a satellite had man were close to multiple Russian geosynchronous satellites to collect intelligence on their characteristics and capabilities and use stealth technologies in order to stay hidden from the Russian surveillance systems. The Prowler is believed to have been decommissioned in 1998. In 2006, the US launched 2 satellites into GSO under the Microsatellites Technology experiment METEX to identify, integrate, test and evaluate small satellite technologies to support. And enhance future space missions. Experts have committed that these satellites would be conducting Rpos in GSO in 2014 and 2016 as part of the Geosynchronous Space Situation Awareness Program, GSAP. the US Air Force has launched 2 pairs of small satellites in near Geo orbits, and as far as their technology is concerned, they're positioning at the altitude slightly above and below the GSO belt has enabled them to do close inspections of objects in the Geo region. Data from the Isan Space Surveillance Network, managed by the Russian Academy of Sciences, suggest that the GSAP satellites have undertaken hundreds of maneuvers since 2014, including close approaches or proximity operations on more than dozen operational satellites in Jio. Reportedly, these satellites have undertaken close approaches of several U.S. military satellites, as well as several Russian and Chinese military satellites, and even commercial satellites developed by China and operated by other countries. In April 2018, the US also launched multiple small satellites in Jio under the Eagle agreement. Experiment. Sorry. At least one of these satellites Mycroft are reported to have undertaken rendezvous proximity operations. Looking at the sort of an overall assessment of the US program, the capability demonstration undertaken by the XSS 10 excesses 11 Orbital Express, MUTEX, Prowler, GSAP and others. Clearly says that it's for on orbit satellite servicing functions and close up inspections. But clearly these could be quickly modified to into a Co orbital capability. Similarly, now moving on to the next country, China has developed similar capabilities in the past decade and 1/2 which I'm going to be discussing next. China has undertaken multiple tests of technologies for round of approximately operations in both the Leo and Geo, which like the US could lead to a core orbital capability. So far, China has not conducted an actual destructive intercept of a satellite using the RPO options. And there is no evidence to suggest that China has developed these technologies with a counter space utility as a goal. It is reported mostly that these are being developed for intelligence gathering purposes. Like the US, China has conducted a number of tests. The first of the tests was done in Leo in 2010. In June, June August 2010, China's SJ 12 satellite initiated a series of deliberate changes in its arbitrary orbital trajectory to approach and run away with the SJ06F satellite. The purpose was supposedly to measure space environment and context space experiments, but experts have commented that the mission was an Electronic Intelligence Elite collection, or signals and intelligence effort for the Chinese military. In July 2013, China placed three satellites in similar orbits, and the stated purpose was the scientific experiments on space maintenance technology. The satellites were nevertheless found to be engaged in capture and surveillance activities. The satellites used were SY, 7SJ15, and CX3, all of which were found in various kinds of RPO operations. In June 2016, Along one was launched by China causing concerns about an on on orbit grappling. As far as the technology is concerned, the satellite demonstrated a capability of using a robot arm to capture a small piece of space debris for removal from orbit and possibly also refueling experiments. A Chinese researcher from Beijing commented that this has the potential for to be used as a space weapon. November 2016 China lofted the SJ 17 satellite to Jio on made the launch of its new Long March 5 new Long Five sorry new slot space launch rate, the Long March 5 reportedly to test higher performance solar cells, new structural components, and so on and so forth. But the satellite is again reported to have undertaken approaching an apparently dead Chinese communication satellite parked in the graveyard orbit with a couple of other hundred other meters couple a couple of 100 meters. Which is, in a sense incredibly close by space standards and reportedly also undertook proximity operations with at least other four of the Chinese satellites. December 2018 TJS 3 satellite was launched into an elliptical geosynchronous trans aerobic GTO. According to Chinese media, it was a Communication Technologies test satellite, but experts have suggested that this is possibly testing missile warning sensors, deployable antennas or other technology. But. There has been very little open information to go by. In October 2021, China launched the Xi Jinping 21 Estate 21 satellite to Jio and RPO missions to validate technologies that will remove space debris. A few months later, HJ 21 reportedly performed many advanced tests and manures, including the release of a sub satellite or Apogee Kick Motor AKM with close approach with other satellites in Jio, RPO's with SJ21 AKM and other satellites including their Compass G2 satellite, part of the Chinese BEDO navigation. Constellation. In terms of the assessment, overall assessment on the Chinese program, there is a broad agreement that China's satellites SJ12SJ15, SJ 17, TJS AIR 3, AKM are in technological terms consistent with RPO demonstration capabilities for the purpose of on orbit satellite servicing, space situational awareness and inspection. Coming to Russia, it has hit an ignored counter space capabilities for a couple of decades, but it's lately seen to be revamping some of its Cold War era counter space technologies. Since 2010, Russia has begun testing many of the technologies required for RPO missions in Leo and Geo that could evolve or into or support a Co orbital is that capability. It is also reported that Russia is possibly working on a new car which is a program. Budapest, Nick. Possibly supported by a surveillance and tracking program called Nebula. These technologies could prove useful prove to be useful in non aggressive functions such as surveilling or inspecting foreign satellites. But the Russia released 2 sub satellites at high speed indicate that some of the Leo RPO activities could be of a weapons nature. During the Cold War, Russia had conducted multiple tests starting from the late 1950s. For over 3 decades, Russia's highest system involved, for instance, a large vehicle based on the R36 missile launched from dedicated launch pads in Kazakhstan. Technologically this way hit to kill cohorbital Aesats. Once launched into orbit, the interceptor and the booster got separated. The interceptor made several changes to its orbit in order to gain close proximity to the target and then explode, releasing A shrapnel within a range of 50 kilometres. Further, in 1990 to 94, Russia is thought to have tested the Nadiad 5 advanced orbital system. But from 2013 onwards China has sort of. Russia has been much more serious about this, developing a series of satellites including COSMOS 249124992504 and 2521 to test salt that maneuvering capabilities through a project conceived in 2011, also for SSA capabilities and providing a support role for other counter space system. Beginning in 2011, Russia also tested active Co orbital ASA program. Code name Borovus, Nick or Petrol for RPO missions Also in 2011, like I said, the Nebula program had started and Russia is reported to have launched 2 satellites Cosmos 2519 and 2491. These were inspection satellites but one that could undertake supportive role for Borivas Nick by validating the RPO technology or servicing with tracking and targeting support. Further, in July 2019 Russia launched 4 military satellites Cosmos 232535. 25362537 and 2538. Which all engaged in a series of RPO experiments. Another military satellite to COSMOS 2542 was launched to conduct space surveillance as well as Earth remote sensing in December 2019. COSMOS 2542 released a small sub satellite designated by the US as COSMOS 2543, which went on to conduct a series of maneuvers that would please COSMOS 2543 in an orbit closer to the US intelligence satellite. Classified U.S. intelligence satellites USA 245 part of the latest generation of Electro optical imagery satellite. These satellites were in close proximity of 20 kilometres several times in January 2020. Russia has also conducted a series of RPO experiments in Geo. So while everyone understands the important consequences of these actions, there are these systems are still being pursued by some states with the goal of presumably maintaining an edge. And because they don't want to be left behind in one of the critical national security technologies. It is very likely that the rapidly altering geopolitics and the changing balance of power dynamics will continue to determine the trajectory in outer space affairs, while outer space had managed to stay free of the terrestrial politics for a while. Major power rivalry has intensified to an extent where the geopolitics on Earth is extended to outer space as well. Also, the early trends towards shifting from space militarization to space weaponization is, like I said in the beginning, is dangerous because that is a slippery slope that can provide an imperative for a large number of players to weaponize outer space without considering in entirety the implications of their own actions. While the competition is already on among the two top few players, including China, Russia, and the US, it's a matter of time before this goes from a peaceful space to militarized space. Domain of active warfare, but the implications are not going to be limited to the security sector. The effects are going to be felt across many domains including the civilian activities as well. Given the growing relevance of space for important functions in the social and economic domains including health, disaster response, weather forecasting, directional data, financial transaction, any loss or degradation of space assets would have multi domain effects. Also the globalization of space would mean that. The impact is not going to be limited to a specific country, but it's going to have wider ramifications across geography, geographies. Any destruction or destruction cost to satellite functioning will also have a critical military functions including the ability to gather ISR data, PNT data, situational awareness capabilities and of course communication. In addition, there's also affect the pure civilian and scientific missions which will have a larger impact on science and technology. And innovation, let me stop here and I'll be happy to hear your thoughts and questions. Thank you.",0
S2M54,2,5,The Hillasa Center Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Science,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Dear delegates, dear members of the open-ended Working Group. My name is Peter Bohaccik. I'm a researcher at the Highlights Laser Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences as well as the Association of International Affairs. I'm honored to be here on the panel to discuss the current and future space to space threats by states to space systems. I was asked to address the following questions. What are the trends in the development and deployment of lasers in outer space? What are their capabilities and uses? Can space based lasers designed for non hostile means such as communications be used to intentionally interfere with, disrupt, damage or destroy satellites? There are significant risks of unintended acts of interference imitating from non hostile users of space based laser. And if so, how can such acts be distinguished from intentional acts? Laser technology offers numerous potential benefits in space in areas from space traffic management to communications to space resource utilization, planetary defense, and interstellar travel. These benefits are matched by the number of safety and security risks. Arising from the absence of norms and rules of responsible use of lasers in space, this can include intentional and unintentional misuses of otherwise benign technology. Firstly, satellite laser engine provides precise and up to age data addressing the otherwise lack of accurate data on orbital objects. That represents an important limitation to global space traffic management capabilities, despite Earth's orbits being spacious for. Well over 100,000 of satellites. What limits the use of earths orbits is not necessarily the spatial dimension of the domain, but our capacities to ensure the safety, reliability and long term sustainability of space traffic management. The existing space traffic management capacities however are already stretched and their capability to deal with exponential growth of objects is uncertain. Additionally the rise of mega constellations and new methods of low propulsion maneuvering of satellites. Also makes some techniques of the modeling of the space environment less accurate, increasing the need for more up-to-date data on objects trajectories. The limits of space traffic management capabilities are partially defined by the number of collision warnings that satellite operators must check and act on, with the majority of them being false due to imprecise data on the 10s of thousands of operational and non operational objects. With estimates that by the year 2029 there might be up to 2.5 million collision warnings. Year. With an average of 40 orbital collisions a year, more sensors and more precise data will be critical to lowering the number of false collision warnings. Laser technology represents an effective solution for monitoring these objects precisely and with precise data. Moreover, they can serve for active removal of small debris which is otherwise challenging to achieve. Concepts for the application of ground based laser technology are investigated and developed for maneuvering orbital debris using full time pressure as well as removing debris with laser ablation, while space based laser instruments for objects ablation are being developed for private and public institutions. Laser skin provide valuable solutions in the area of space resource utilization. The utilization of various chemical elements and mineral resources available in space, especially on the Moon and Near Earth asteroids is a critical step for sustainable human expansion space. They can also be used for planetary defense, advanced propulsion system or interstellar travel. Most attention in recent years has been given to laser communication that enables significantly larger data transfers, long distance communication, but as well as new methods for secure communication through quantum key distribution. China, Russia and the United States. Can be considered the main actors in the areas of testing and development of anti satellite laser systems. U.S. officials in the past have claimed that China has tested a ground based laser to blind AUS satellite, which could also be interpreted not necessarily as a testing of a weapon, but of a satellite tracking system. US Defense Intelligence Agency has repeatedly described China's Satellite Laser Ranging stations as a threat to US satellites. Mobile satellite laser engine units. Offer another type of a dual threat capability which strips satellites of many ways to protect themselves against laser dazzling, blinding or damage while they pass over known permanent satellite laser ranging base, With France and Germany having developed or are currently developing mobile satellite laser ranging units, both France and Germany have these units and in 2020 Russia has made public detailed information about a new Russian mobile. Satellite dazzling laser system per seven. Which is believed to be deployable on ground vehicles as well as an aircraft. Additionally, new analysis has revealed a significant amount of information about a construction of a Russian ground based laser ranging station, Kalina, intended to not only track but also target and blind satellites in orbit. Further, Francis unveiled plans to construct a laser armed satellite constellation to destroy satellites posing threats. To French space assets in act of self-defense. South Korea has announced plans to develop anti satellite laser systems and space based lasers for surveillance and tracking capabilities. Furthermore, another 20 to 30 states including countries like Libya or Iran have reported or been considered as possessing anti satellite laser capabilities to interfere with satellites. The direct threat of satellite blinding by a low power ground lasers. Roast the prominence after testing of the US two of the United States two MW advanced chemical laser in 1997 on a defunct US Air Force satellites. During the testing the main laser failed, but another small only 30 Watt laser surprisingly demonstrated capabilities to temporarily blind Electro optical satellites. Even low power lasers have the capability to temporarily blind, jam, and interfere with Electro optical satellites. Low power lasers ranging from as little as 10 watts. Are capable of dazzling and temporarily blinding a satellite imagining sensor, while even a 40 Watt laser star guide system can easily permanently damage silicon photo sensor ray or silicon diodes on Electro optical satellites. Note that the ladder power level is appropriate for a laser ranging of space debris as well. Therefore, it is difficult to draw a line between what laser scan cost temporarily by dazzling. And what laser scan leads to permanent damage? What when used for space debris maneuvering by photon pressure or ablation, lasers can be used for hardly attributable actions. Maneuvering of space debris can accommodate malicious intent if the debris is redirected as a kinetic weapon into another satellite or another piece of debris, making the maneuver appear as an error while rather aiming for debris fragments than for the integral space debris. Moving Space Breeze by the ablation method can easily damage other satellites. Methods of space based laser ablation are being developed as well to function on the typical materials satellites are made of aluminum, composite materials, titanium alloy, hardened steel and so on. Since it is the most of the pieces of satellites that make up the debris, the threshold of laser Fluence for ablation of such materials is estimated somewhere between 5:00 to 7:00 joules per centimeter square at pose length in the nano 2nd wrench, which is typically proposed for ground based laser ablative debris removal. Considering that a fraction of 10 to 60% of disfluence might enter the irradiated object in form of residual heat such surface surface energy. Would be fatal to a satellite if it was directed at a payloads or the satellite bus. Especially in the case of highly repetitive irradiation, for example on tanks with fuel or batteries. Similar thermal risk depending on debris absorbability applies for debris nudging by photon pressure. That demands several tenths of kilowatts on the spot of a few square centimeters, however, without the additional risk that arises from laser induced shockwaves in the case of laser ablation. Also, if any benevolent actor wishes to act on their maneuvering, they become liable for any incidents resulting from the final trajectory. Such existing legal framework can complicate the use of laser debris removing, giving its high necessity of reliable prediction of laser imparted momentum. That however depends on the variety of parameters like beam pointing, offset, jitter, tracking uncertainty, target orientation. As far as albedo in case of the photon pressure. As the origins of millions of small debris cannot be easily determined, this leaves the culprits unaccountable for their mission, the laser operators, even if their ultimate goal is to move the debris. They would become accountable for those pieces if they caused an unexpected collision. In case of high power realized array, the fractions of a powerful laser beam from an intentionally irradiated object could unintentionally blind sensors from other satellites. In more advanced concept for the use of laser technology for planetary defense, the capability to change the trajectory of a near Earth object, even a small one, could be misused to direct it towards another actor's space assets for the low power lasers for communications. The targeted irradiance. As low as 25 microwatts per square meter cannot be considered as a sufficient energy for blinding a camera. Yet with the high precision that is required for this technology and the beam control, such system can be used for disrupting other laser systems by generating noise signals in highly sensitive photo photon detectors. The absence of norms for laser use in space does not only increase the likelihood of their intentional misuse due to the absence of clear rules, but most importantly it increases a chance of unintentional incidents. Intentional use can be motivated by self-defense, for example if a ground based lasers are used to blind optical payloads of reconnaissance satellites as they pass above sensitive infrastructure critical to national security or if space based lasers are used as a protection against the non cooperative satellites conducting a close proximity operation. Similarly, the intent can be clearly offensive if lasers are used to blind space based sensors of an anti ballistic missile system or damage payloads of satellites. To summarize, 3 characteristics of laser using space play an important role in the discussions about their responsible using space. First, laser systems can be used for both malicious and peaceful purposes by their original design, increasing the risk of disguising the original intent of use. If a debris maneuvering laser is used to maneuver a dangerous piece of debris onto the path of another satellite, it could be hard to distinguish whether this was an accident or a malicious intent. Secondly, the use of lasers in many cases can be very hard to detect and thus verifiable. Unless an imagining payload of a reconnaissance satellite malfunctions over an area which is known to have ground based laser or during a close proximity maneuvering by non cooperative laser arm satellite, it would be hard to attribute damage to lasers. Thirdly, while lasers can have only a temporary or permanent effect on a satellite function. The threshold between what can cause temporary and permanent damage is technically hard to establish. What the intentions to temporarily laser blind a satellite sensor in self-defense be considered the same as a permanent laser damage to a satellite with the same intent. This absence of norms in the area increases risk of unintentional escalation as the original intent, whether it is to temporarily or permanently by the sensor for defensive or offensive reasons. Many of these issues fall in the within the absence of general enormous outer space. What constitutes a right to self-defense by spacecraft on an orbit? What is the minimum distance for conducting non cooperative rendezvous and proxy operations or close proximity operations before it is considered a threat? And what mechanisms can lead to international community to lower such risks? Verification, transparency and confidence building measures are considered the main tools for arms control. Among the best practices belong notifications, registrations. And disclosure consultations and maintenance of direct lines of communications and information sharing on capabilities. Yet these measures can differ for each technical area. Most importantly, they require a prior agreement agreement on what information needs to be shared on what type of behavior to ensure equal distribution of compliance, benefits and costs. There are two institutions that serve as a good starting point in terms of information sharing about the laser use in space and measures to prevent intentional or unintentional misuses. It is the Laser Clearing House established by the United States Department of Defense. Secondly, it is the International Laser Ranging Service. Both the Laser Clearing House and the International Laser Ranging Service provide ideas and platforms for steps ahead in international coordination of laser use in space. Firstly, the laser cleaning house can be an example of a national authorization process to ensure safe laser use in space. For other laser operating nations, direct lines of communications between national laser clearing houses or laser use contact points could provide an important the conflicting tool. Secondly, the International Laser Ranging Service provides a platform for building trust and transparency by sharing information about capabilities plans. And intentions. For laser use in space in the case of the International Laser Raging Service, not all ground lasers ranging stations are part of the network or share their details. Other activities such as laser space debris maneuvering or use of space borne lasers are not covered by the service. Sharing information about tracking missions and program outside of those carried out under the International Laser Ranging Service would be available confidence building measures. With this remarks, I thank you, the Chair for the floor and distinguished delegates. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to my fellow panelists remarks and any questions that might arise. Thank you.",0
S2M56,2,5,Unidir,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates. Firstly, I would like to thank the Chair and the Secretariat of this open-ended working group for organizing this panel and for inviting unity to be a part of this important discussion. My name is Almudena Cara de Ortega and I lead research on space security issues at Unity. It is an honour to be part of this distinguished group of panelists as well as be part of the group of experts that have been speaking during this second session of the OEWG in the days prior. As we continue to discuss. Space to space Throughout today, the topic that I will be speaking about is something that has actually been frequently raised by states as an issue of concern and as highlighted in the working paper, that unit is admitted for this session. The issue in question is the dual nature of many space systems, which states often refer to as dual use, but which, as I will explain throughout the course of this presentation, are actually 2 distinct categories of objects. Dual use on the one hand, and dual purpose space systems on the other hand. So what exactly are these dual use and dual Parker space systems? Who operates them? Under what circumstances can they be targeted under international law and what would the consequences of a disruption, damage and destruction be? These are the questions that I've been asked to answer. So if we could go to the next slide please. That is how I plan to structure my presentation for today. Firstly, I will provide a breakdown of what exactly it is that states are concerned about followed by. A detailed definition of what these dual use and these dual purpose objects are, and then I will wrap up to explain whether these can be targeted or not, and what the consequences of such targeting would be. So as it has already been mentioned this week, space systems are complex and they are made out of different segments, not all of which are located in space. However, for the purposes of this presentation today and since today's topic three is spaces space threats, I will be focusing only on the space segment. If we could go to the next slide, please. So what is it exactly that states are concerned about? It is often said that space technology is increasingly essential to humankind, providing multitude of services that are considered indispensable for the continued health, wealth and welfare of billions of people on Earth. Service oriented infrastructure such as global navigation satellite systems or earth observation satellites and communication satellites are capable of carrying out vast array of tasks that make many of the services we rely on everyday accessible to us. For example, these satellites make safe navigation possible in the air, on land and at sea. Satellite services also allow humankind to have access to high speed Internet, carry out electronic financial transactions. As well as control and manage cells and critical infrastructures and services such as energy grids, water and transportation. These same satellites are also used in the context of defence and security, that is to say, they carry out military functions. It is important to recall that under outer space law, outer space shall be used only for peaceful purposes and this has generally been interpreted and understood to mean non aggressive or non hostile rather than non military, and therefore there are actually many satellites that carry out to military functions. Many of them carry these military functions at the same time as they do civil or commercial functions. Earth observation and remote sensing satellites, for example, provide militaries with intelligence, surveillance, and records, and data that enables militaries to identify adversary capabilities, track troop movements, and locate potential targets. They also provide information to facilitate disaster relief and humanitarian assistance operations. Communications satellites can provide encrypted communications and improve situational awareness, which allows military forces greater mobility. And positioning, navigation and timing satellites. And their data allows for more precise and discriminative targeting for munition as well As for navigation. On the on land, at sea, and on the air. Such space systems that are used to carry both these military and civilian functions have been generally termed as dual use. And this duality is a characteristic shared by many space systems and has been highlighted by many states as an issue of concern capable of threatening space security due to the role that these can play in fostering mistrust among space actors. States worry that the operational ambiguity of these objects could contribute to raising tensions among states. And more specifically, what states worry about is that the military services provided by these dual use assets could make them targetable by anniversary, even when they also provide civilian or Commercial Services. Separate from this concern, states have also expressed worries about technologies that are developed for commercial or civilian objectives of an entirely benign nature, such as, for example. Orbits, servicing and refueling or active debris removal. But that dated their characteristics and due to their capabilities for example we've been talking about this I I think it was Raji that mentioned it having a robotic arm to repair satellites or having a harpoon or a laser as the as the previous panelists mentioned. To also remove space debris from orbit. Those characteristics could be repurposed to harm space objects. These objects are developed to serve a solely non military and non aggressive purpose. But the potential that they have to be repurposed and to act as counter space technology has caused many to include these objects under the dual use umbrella. But a more accurate term that is increasingly being used by some to refer to this second category is dual purpose. So we could go to the next slide. I'm gonna focus a bit more on these two definitions and and how they are distinct. Um, so yes, there are two distinct categories of space objects that states have expressed concerns about. Dual use on the one hand and dual purpose on the other hand. The distinction is important as the concerns stemming from the use of these objects are also different. They are perceived as two different threats with which therefore require different approaches. The times dual use and dual purpose. Before we get into what is what exactly, I like to point out that these terms are actually derived from existing law. They are derived from the the distinction established between use and purpose in the laws of targeting. Under targeting regulations, only military objectives can be targeted, and I've pointed out the relevant articles in the slide. Military objectives can be identified by their nature, location, purpose or use. Purpose and use obviously are the ones relevant for the discussions, for the discussion that we're having here for my presentation. Use is concerned with the present function of an object, while purpose is concerned with its intended feature. Use. And I'd like you to to remember this for for now when I'm gonna. Sort of breakdown the definitions of of each of these objects. If we could go to the next slide please. First, on dual use face objects. These can have a military and security function as I was saying, but they can also have a civilian or commercial one, and these functions can be simultaneous or alternating and alternate use is sometimes known as dual capable, although this term is not really commonly used. They can be operated by the military, even to provide services to civilians, so certain GNSS services are an example of this, and they can also be operated by civilian or commercial actors. Even to carry out to military functions this militaries can sometimes outsource certain services, particularly for a satellite communications or remote sensing. These objectives are known as dual use precisely because they are intended. To serve civilian and military users. That is the reason why they were created. If we could go to the next slide. In this light, we can see how one function can serve these two different uses. If we could go to the next slide. Now for dual purpose objects, what are these? These objects are designed to fulfill a benign objective, as I was saying before, such as debris removal or on orbit servicing, but they could potentially be repurposed to harm another space object. They are generally operated by civilian entities as well as commercial actors. And they are generally developed with no military objective in mind and are not intended to serve any aggressive function. However, it is due to their characteristics or their capabilities, such as, as I was saying, the possession of a robotic arm for example. That they have raised concern amongst stents, and the concern is that these objects could be repurposed to serve sorry to harm another satellite. And it should be noted, and we've been talking about this at these past few days, that the capabilities in and of themselves are not what make these objects a threat. In the sense I think several delegations use the term capability neutral and I think this accurately reflects that the capabilities of dual pubs objects alone do not pose a danger to space actors. It is the challenge of discerning and operators intent when utilizing these assets. What has led many to perceive these assets are themselves as a threat even when they are used in a relatively transparent manner. If we could go to the next slide, please. So here I tried to sort of highlight that even though dual use and dual purpose objects are different, they can sometimes share characteristics that could in theory cause them to qualify as both dual use and purpose at the same time, which I apologise, makes things a little bit more confusing. For example a dual use satellite with manoeuvring capabilities. Could be repurposed to act as a counter space weapon. By causing it to maneuver so that it collides with another satellite. I do have to point out though that in practice. Such situations would be relatively unlikely as they would be impractical and they would also be very costly. If we could go to the next slide, please. So now to focus on the third part of my presentation and on whether these dual use and dual purpose objects are targetable. Before analysing the issue of targetability, I think it's important to recall that under the Charter of the United Nations, the use of force is prohibited and that is enshrined in Article 2, four of the UN Charter. The only exception to this rule is of course enshrined in our School 51 of the UN Charter by which a state may exercise the right of individual or collective self defence. In the case of an armed attack. I will focus here on dual purpose objects as these are the ones that present concern for state in terms of the possibility that they could be used to harm another satellites. So if the threshold of an armed attack indicated in our School 51 of the UN Charter was reached, or could potentially be reached for the purposes of anticipatory self defence, it would theoretically be possible to target a door, sorry, a dual purpose object. Provided that such action complied with key principles of the laws of targeting and the use of force. Firstly, for the purposes of targeting, it's important to highlight that an object doesn't really have a dual nature. It is either targetable or a targetable military objective, or it is not. And so a dual purpose object that was repurposed to attack a satellite, for example, could be considered targetable. In the cases of anticipatory self-defense, I do have to point out that it has to be taken into account that if intelligence is incomplete as to the repurposing of the object, and thus as to the status as a targetable military objective, a mere hypothetical repurposing would not turn the object into a targetable military objective. Instead, there must be certain reasonable probability that the object may be repurposed. Because the main objective possibility of it is insufficient, and this goes back to the the idea of capability neutral. Just because an object has certain capabilities or characteristics like a robotic arm, it does not automatically make it a threat. If we could go to the next slide, please. Secondly. The self defensive action that targeted a dual purpose object would have to comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality, also known as proportional response and timeliness, that apply in the laws of the use of force. Firstly, in accordance to the principle of necessity, the use of force is always a last resort, so the targeted state must ensure that there is no measure, short of the use of military force, that will effectively prevent a future attack or the imminent attack. Secondly, the principle of timeliness or imminence establishes that the active self-defense must happen with a reasonable proximity in time to the hostile act. It should not be an act of retaliation or provocation against the other, but rather it should be an act of protection or defense if one's security. That's why it's called self-defense. In the case of anticipatory self-defense, the action cannot be due to a mere hypothetical possibility of attack. And certainly the principle of proportionality or proportional response requires that the force used in self-defense be limited in scope, intensity and duration. To that which is reasonably necessary to counter the sorry to counter the attack or neutralize the threat. So the harm that would be caused by the use of force in self-defense cannot be appreciatively greater than the harm that would occur if the threat were not intercepted. Also, it should be taken into account that the reasonable the reasonably foreseeable reverberating effects of the attack must be taken into consideration as part of this proportionality analysis. So the consequences of targeting a dual purpose asset include the disruption, either temporary or permanent of the service they provide. It could prevent the repair or the refueling of a satellite in the case of an on orbit servicing assets for example. Depending on the method used to target the asset there could also be additional consequences, for example the creation of the of debris if kinetic force were used. The consequences would be greater, and here I'm going to shift to dual use. So the consequences would be greater and felt more deeply by people on Earth if the targeted satellite was a dual use item, as they provide many services of critical importance for life and Earth. I enumerated some examples at the beginning of my presentation. Access to high speed Internet or the possibility of carrying out electronic financial transactions etc etc. It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which a dual use space ACID would be used to harm another satellite, since as I described before, they don't really have aggressive capabilities. The military functions mostly serve to assist military activities on Earth. However, the targeting of these satellites is much more plausible in the context of an armed conflict on Earth if dual use space objects provide an effective contribution to military actions in the context of such conflict and that effective contribution is exceeds the relevance of the services provided to civilians. They could be targetable. This, which is known as the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law, would have to be considered in conjunction with other principles of RHL, such as military necessity, proportionality, and precautions. However, it should be noted that while most states agree that I tell applies to outer space, not everyone does. I will therefore not delve into the details of these principles at this time. But I would nevertheless like to under score that these principles can serve to lend clarity to the targetability issue of space assets in the context of unarmed conflict on Earth. To conclude, I like to say that a proper understanding of dual use and dual purpose objects and their differences, coupled with increased transparency regarding their capabilities, but also regarding the way in which these capabilities are used, is necessary to ascertain the threat that they can pose. Only three such understanding can we actually work and succeed to mitigate the threat that they might pose. At Uniden, we are committed to providing any assistance needed to reach common understanding on these issues and as always, we stand ready to support the work of this OEWG and we'll be happy to answer any questions that its members may have. Thank you very much for your attention.",0
S2M58,2,5,The Japan Space Policy at Astro Scale,"Thank you, Chair. Mr. Tear, Excellency, distinguished Delegates, Firstly, I would like to thank the Chair and Secretariat of OEWG for organizing this panel discussion for inviting Astro Scale. My name is Aya Yamato from Master Scale Japan. It is an honor for me to be part of this important discussion with distinguished panelists. Next slide, please. Our daily lives depend on predictable, stable and safe space environment. That's our vision at Astro Scale. And sustainable development of space for the benefit of future generation. Astro Scale is a global company headquarters in Japan. Next slide please. We are solely dedicated to on Orbit services across all of it and we are committed to safety in space and sustainable operations. Next slide please. We emphasize the development of technology, business cases and smart policy for. Sustainability. Together with the focus on collaboration across the state space community, our approach means Astro Scale holistically solves problems. We don't just sell technology. Next slide please. So due to the recent exponential increase of space, object outer space is becoming increasingly congested. We must both prevent and cure. Next slide please. What I mean by this is that remediation of the space environment, removal of defunct objects, is essential for space sustainability. In addition to existing mitigation efforts, commercial companies have proposed new and innovative servicing concepts, technology and capabilities for onorbit servicing. These proposed services include active debris removal on orbit, life extension, repair, refueling. Manufacturing, assembly and end of life disposal of satellite as well as the commercial on orbit space situational awareness capabilities. These innovative services are indispensable to make sure. The future access to space for all states, not only for space varying nations, but for all states so that we can all benefit from the use of Earth object. Next slide please. Technology used for on orbit servicing including active debris removal, ADR, dual use, nature, much like most space capabilities. After hearing Alumni's presentation. Maybe I should call it your purpose, but anyway it is imperative for us to increase transparency and to build trust for commercial ADR and honorable servicing missions. What makes activities harmful is not decided by technology itself, but how it is used. And intention behind its use. How to distinguish between benign and harmful Intention is key, which is often difficult to judge without adequate information. Thus knowing and describing what is good behavior and all it can lead to our path towards understanding of commercial space activities. So I was provided this question by Secretary What steps are commercial actors taking to promote responsible behavior in connection with our PO rendezvous and proximity operation? And before answering to the question, I would like to highlight the two aspects that help establish good behavior of commercial operators. First, it is the commercial sector's best interest to keep outer space predictable, safe, secure and sustainable for our business. Very strong incentives exist to operate responsibly in space among commercial space actors. To do otherwise would put at risk the money the industry has invested in building and launching spacecraft to serve customers. Second, commercial sectors need to get licensed by applicable law and regulation that requires safety of the mission operation as required by Outer Space Treaty Article 6 to have authorization and continuing supervision. Our operations are bound by respective domestic laws and regulation and some states are reviewing or updating their domestic regulation to ensure commercial actors do not create and due risk in orbit. So moving on to the slide, sorry, maybe, maybe. Yeah. So now moving on to the question, what states are steps commercial actors taking to promote responsible behavior in connection with RPO? As I is mentioned, it is important to distinguish and define what is responsible RPO and what is not. Commercial space actors need to be transparent about their activities and show their commitment for space sustainability through voluntary best practices and going above the regulatory minimums when it is, when it is possible. Developing industry best practices standards, our own norms is important in this regard. So the comfort confers. Sorry, the pronunciation is a little bit tricky. CONFERS, the Consortium for Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operation is a good example for this. It is an independent self-sustaining industry forum with more than 50 companies across the globe. Its activities are to research, develop and publish voluntary consensus, technical and safety standards for onorbit servicing. In fact, a new ISO standard has been published based on the work of CONFERS, known as ISO 24330. The commercial office community is resolved to be contributing to a safe and sustainable operation in space. Some of the key elements for transparency of commercial RPO identify by confers that delegates could take into consider for this discussion include ensuring performance of servicing operation as conducted on a consensual client, working with proper state authority to provide notification on ongoing RPO operations, avoid physical contract contact with other space objects, minimize close approaches to other space objects. Notify affected 30 third parties in advance of any close approaches and exchange information necessary to support safety of a Space Flight. For example, point of contacts or ephemeris, while respecting intellectual property and propriety or sensitive information sharing information on the on the resolution of spacecraft anomalies, failures that related to root cause analysis. Next slide please. Yes, so Astroscale, we are active member of Confers, but we also take our own measures or initiatives to make sure the transparency of safety of our mission. The picture shows this is our satellite code LCD End of Life Services by Astro Scale Demonstration learned March 2021 to demonstrate the core technology necessary for debris stocking and removal using magnetic docking plate. So for this LC. We obtained a mission license from UK government and the satellite is registered by Japan, so we abide by the respective regulations. And for information sharing, we share our mission plan, goal and activities through our website or media or by attending conferences and workshop. We have also issued several press release to update the mission operation including anomaly condition, mission success, completion of RPO. Next slide please. So this is another mission or next mission called address J. This is the unknown as commercial. Debris Removal Demonstration CRD 2 Phase One project by JAXA Japan Space Agency. This satellite is expected to be launched in 2023 and we are currently discussing a government of Japan for mission licensing as well as the New Zealand government. For payload license because it is going to be launched from the New Zealand. So these are our efforts to make sure transparency next slide please. So moving on to the next question, what action should states take to ensure such activities are not regarded as threats. So states can take measures to make sure transparency of commercial RPO through their licensing and regulation as a part of the their delegation. Sorry obligation of Article 6 of OST. New and innovative commercial technologies, capabilities and services often do not fall into the existing license framework. Relevant states have so far licensed mission demonstration of on our servicing capabilities on ad hoc basis through their licensing framework. It is desirable for the commercial sector to have predictable, clear yet flexible licensing framework that promotes innovation, innovative commercial activities. Next slide please. One example of such state effort is Japan's On Orbit Servicing Guidelines for Licensing on Orbit Servicing Mission, which was released last November. In addition to regular mission license requirement, this guideline requests an operator who conducts or as mission from three aspect legality, safety and transparency. As for transparency, it sets operators responsibilities such as sharing, mission outline, publicly notification and reporting of operation, including a case of emergency as anomaly and accidents with government and other operators. And also use the SSA services. It also sets government of Japan's responsibility as a state as sharing mission outline and report operation and sharing information with other states. It is also the guideline is also intended that it contributes transparency of commercial on our servicing mission by developing the clear guideline for safety and sharing the result of mission to the extent possible. So our next mission address Jay, it is not only about technology demonstration but also demonstrate how. Licensing on our servicing works. Transparency. I think, I'm sure, yeah. Transparency and encouraging certain regulatory pathway that provides effective oversight and continuous supervision is very important. Through that process safe and responsible commercial on orbit servicing norms will be formed and shared globally, globally shared norms of behavior for safe and responsible commercial. And orbit servicing forms a basis of trust and transparency. It is also important to note that states here industries views and voice and discuss with other states when developing regulation so that the regulation can respect proprietary issues or without being too prescriptive. Government Japan has invited industry industry commercial company including Astro Scalement developing guidelines. It is also in the state's interest to develop domestic space industry as well as maintain space sustainability for all. It is also important to be full thinking, so I've been talking about domestic aspects so far. But it is also important to be forward thinking and not just domestic oversight of on over servicing activities, but states come together for global understanding of responsible commercial on orbit servicing operation and best practices. After all, servicing spacecraft and commercial scale will involve multiple government stakeholders. As I explained, our satellite involves several governments. So maybe this is where appropriate forum maybe like you and Corpus proceeding could possibly support safety and transparency for commercial on over servicing mission. Lastly, I appreciate the chair for creating opportunity for commercial companies to be included in the discussion. The commercial sector also has a stake and responsibility to keep space environment safe and sustainable. We believe that there is a value in bringing commercial players to the discussion of space governance. Thank you very much.",0
S2M510,2,5,United States,"Thank you and thank you to the panelists for these excellent presentations and very detailed presentations today. On these range of topics, considering you know each individual panelists, we wondered if you could reflect on the verification issues. Inherent in each of your your subject areas, you know we heard about lasers and there were many different powers of lasers that could do things like range but also damage and then the on orbit servicing, you know how to tell when when a capability might be as nefariously or not. So I was wondering wondering if each panelist could reflect on that. Thank you.",2
S2M512,2,5,Cuba,"Good morning. Thank you very much to all the speaker for these excellent presentations. Thank you very much to you, chair, for having organised this panel. I would just like to thank Miss Ortega for her excellent presentation. It was a presentation which has spoken about a number of. Issues which I think we all have to bear in mind. In Partic. The use of force under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, and in that regard I agree with you with regard to the fact that. When it comes to the use of space for military purposes, what is the most likely in terms of a conflict in space is that this happened after following on from a conflict on Earth. When spacecraft are used and contribute to a conflict on Earth. So I have a question to pose in this regard. In your opinion. If there is a response coming from Earth during a conflict, a conflict which involves the use of objects in orbit, do you think? That that response would be a violation. Of the peaceful use of space. In the light of Article 51 of the UN Charter. So if we're in a situation where there's a conflict on Earth and if. Uses a satellite for military purposes and if another state, the state which is under conflict, if that state responds and attacks that satellite, that object in space. In that situation, what would be the basis under Article 51 for that it speaks? About legitimacy of war, it doesn't say that it has to be limited to Earth. Of course we need to take into account. Proportionality, the immediacy of the response, but with regard to this Article 51. In in accordance with international law. It's never been stated. I believe that there is a geographical limit to the exercise, the exercise of the right to defence. In general, if you take the example of a state that detects another state, the attack state may decide to begin military operations. On the territory of the state attacking them. This also happens at the sea, for example. During a conflict. An attacked state can decide to respond with a military action. On the high seas, which is beyond their National Maritime territory, they can decide to do that. For example, if there's a warship. Which is moving towards the theater of operations. That ship can be sunk, so I don't think that there is a limit to the exercise of that right, a geographical limit to the exercise of that right. So I would just like to know what you think of those reflections. Of course this is a polemical question, but what do you think about it if a state was to exercise that right to self-defense in extra? In outer space. Using a spacecraft when a spacecraft is used for military purposes in the when there is a conflict on Earth.",2
S2M514,2,5,Unidir,"Thank you Chair. I'm going to start with the question posed by the delegate to the United States on verification issues and how that would affect or would help mitigate the threats that dual use and dual purpose object compose. Especially I I imagine your interest here would be on regarding dual purpose objects. Well, I think verification is always a tricky issue in space when it comes into contact with the issue of intent. And dual pubs object always deal with the issue of intent. So I believe it was Victoria Sampson who yesterday said that SSA data can well, SSA can provide a loss of data, but at the end of the day we have to be able to interpret that data correctly in order for it to be useful. And so here we we can perhaps get data on where a specific satellite is. Is it maneuvering, is it. If it has maneuvered, has it done so in a way that was predictable or not. So these are things that through verification mechanisms like SSA we can assert and but to that we do have to add extra information in order for for those verification. So for that verification data to be useful, and I think here is where the issue of transparency and increased confidence among different actors becomes really important. And I think it's been mentioned by previous panellists during the past couple of days that if there is communication for example regarding the issue of close approaches, then the states involved in those operations are less likely to be suspicious that that close approach could entail the repurposing of of of a dual purpose object for aggressive purposes. So, so that would be that would be my take on on that issue. If I may answer the second question, OK. But, but I just want to reply to the delegation of Cuba. Thank you very much. It's a very interesting question. I think it's rather complex. I'll try to split it up into. Different elements. In if you have a conflict on Earth. Then we're looking at a situation of use in Bello. What applies, therefore, is the law of war or international humanitarian law. The issue of legitimate defence or violations of Article 2, four of the Charter, that's more a question of the past, because now we're in a situation of conflict. So. I will answer your question with another question which maybe isn't the best, but so that you understand. I think the best question is if there's a violation if there's an attack on a satellite that's providing services to a armed conflict on Earth. And that violence, Article 51 we have to ask then if IHL would apply in outer space. If it does, then IHL gives us a series of tools allowing us to establish whether that attack. Against a satellite, those providing services to a armed conflict is permitted or not, and those tools would be the principle of proportionality, necessity, necessity. Diction etc. So I think that would be a first step. So I think it's a question that states haven't yet fully reached a consensus on. The majority of states say that IHL does apply in space. The SP would have those tools in that case, but that's not the case with all states. And that generates certain uncertainty because depending on the state, depending on the legal vision of that state, its reaction will be different. In my opinion is that if we're in a situation where the conflict has already started on Earth. What applies on Earth at least, is IHL, with which the question of. If there would be a violation of Article 51 would be something. In the past, so to say, except in the case of the satellite that's been attacked is not a satellite under the control or just jurisdiction of any of the belligerent states. In that event then we could open up the question of. Use of force that legitimizes. The activation of Article 51 and of exercising the use of legitimate self-defense. I hope that answers your question. Thank you.",2
S2M516,2,5,The Observer Research Foundation,"Thank you, Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I think, yeah, two questions are both a very interesting set of questions. Let me just take the US colleagues. Question on how we look at the whole issue of verification. I think verification in outer space is extremely challenging, a task actually, even as many states have argued for verifiable instruments when it comes to global governance. Realistically speaking, it is extremely difficult. It is in a sense naive to assume that if anyone says that, they can't actually verify every activity in outer space. This also ties me to a sort of a related issue in a sense, technology versus behavior for instance, it's generally a good approach that we are moving away from a sort of a focus on technology because especially given the Duluth nature. Talked about of these space technologies, there is going to be a problem, sort of a defining technology as a parameter to go about when it comes to global governance. But behaviour also creates a bit of a problem. There's a problem because capabilities usually take a very long time to develop, but behaviour can change overnight. In a sense, the agent, as Aludina said can change very rapidly and states are likely to feel a sense of vulnerability if they do not have the technology for instance to defend themselves. So I think it's a verification is extremely difficult, but at the same time it's also kind of a very challenging in terms of how are you going to verify technology, how are you going to verify behaviour and all of these things or the intent behind states developing certain technologies and everything, these are challenging task in a sense. So the ideal ways to go about dealing with this is to some of the important steps maybe to kind of improve confidence in each other and and that will gradually instill trust that can over a period of time remove the need for developing these capabilities or at least use them, use these technologies in a various fashion. I don't think you can kind of completely give up on these technologies because and you don't do not have an effective way of kind of seeing how these technologies are going to be used. In the past, technology export control, global technology control regimes have been used. But again, given the dual use nature of space, even Corbett capabilities where we talked about RPO and kind of technology services that we are talking about, they do have enormous utility in terms of satellite servicing. Satellite maintenance and all of that. So looking at restraining or restricting those aspects because of the fear of possible use of these technologies in a nefarious fashion, it may not be a very useful way, but again, I think I will go back to some of my. Favorite talking points in a sense, because I think we what we need to do is. Take steps to create better confidence in each other, improving confidence, trust in each other so that we do not come to a scenario where we need to use this technology in a nefarious fashion that is going to be harmful for everybody. Space is truly a global common, so every state, every action is going to create sort of a ripple effect on everybody else in a sense. Second question of the from the delegation of Cuba, right to self-defense in space and how that's I think Almudena has responded to that pretty well. But I think if you look at the whole question, the right to self-defense on Article 51 of the UN Charter, these have been part of many discussions on global governance. It is hard to imagine that states will actually attempt to exercise their right to self-defense because it is going to be, it is going to be literally change sort of converting space into an active domain of warfare. And I think but the concerns about for a number of developing countries in a sense have been about how many of the advanced space players are using the. Right to self-defense argument as a justification to develop more advanced capabilities weaponizing space, I think those have been especially from a lot of developing countries perspective, I think these have been the problem and how they have generally perceived the right to self-defense. But I think exercising that right is going to be again a challenging aspect because you're going to kind of make make out of space an active domain of warfare which is not in anyone its interest. Thank you.",2
S2M518,2,5,The Japan Space Policy at Astro Scale,"I will pick up the question on verification focusing on commercial PO. As everyone said, verification is tricky in outer space activities, but we think knowing and describing what is good behavior in orbit can lead us to pathway forward in this regard. As I mentioned in my presentation, industries best practices on licensing framework helps in terms of setting up norms of behavior. That is the first thing and as well as encouraging information sharing, so like for example when we. Our planned mission, we know what is the client is and we share the information particular client, so sorry and also the use of SSA. So we share information in advance, notify in advance so that the rest of the community can actually check. At least what we are doing is suppose we our satellites approaching to different object other than our declared client, people would know that. Something wrong with it and then information sharing in case of an anomaly people will know that there is something wrong with our servicing satellite. So as again that industry best practices as well as the licensing framework. Information sharing, including SSA is key. And in this regard, I know, I remember that National Security Council in the United States announced last Friday, I think to develop, I think a new framework for innovative. Space activities including servicing. So in this regard, these states initiatives are welcome and it helps verification. Thank you. I thank Missy Wamoto and now we move over back to Miss Mr. Peter. Check you off the floor. So thank you for the question. I will address the question on from the United States on the terms of verification of lasers. Obviously lasers are very hard to verify which you know the beam and the light comes from and obviously in this regard it follows other space technology. But what is maybe even more hard to do is understand more about the laser infrastructure because I'm for verification, just some basic information about. What type of laser infrastructure is being placed on space or or on ground? Would be useful because that would create enough of you know information environment in which you can be sure that what is happening and what could be potentially lasers used for for the use of lasers to maneuver debris. That is obviously an issue linked to the overall SSA domain and space situation awareness there. We know that not everyone has the same data and the same SSA models that. See the objects at the same areas. So that is obviously a gap that could be misused with two different entities claiming that an objects that is to be moved would or would not be or pose a risk to another satellite, and that obviously is a gap that would need to be addressed by again providing information and. Providing that we sort of have the same language when we talk about the things and last I'll come to I guess the most important step that we can take in terms of verification, but overall confidence building and and discussing norms for responsible behavior and that is information sharing. Information sharing in terms of ground based satellite laser ranging platforms and bases has been existing. There are very important data to understand what where an unintentional, you know, peaceful use of lasers can be expected and where a danger for misuse could be expected as well. However, these information sharing mechanisms and platforms do not include space based lasers. So as we move forward with the development of laser technology, I think it will be important to sort of set standards by the industry or governments in terms of technology standards and designs of these systems. This is being done for example in laser communications where thanks to information sharing about the specific designs of such technology, we know what dangers that that technology can pose, but we also know what dangers it cannot pose. Conflict potential risks that could be generated by not understanding the technology well enough and then obviously information sharing about the use of lasers for specific applications, whether if it's the orbit or maneuver specific piece of debris or whether it is to communicate between 2 optical, you know, communication platforms. Sharing such information about operations like this would be critical to sort of deconflict. A potential misuse? In terms of intended use, intended misuse, obviously that's that's a bit of a different scenario, may be much more linked to war scenario and it's really hard to obviously discuss things there. But on the unintentional use, I think information sharing obviously is the key step to do. Thank you.",2
S2M520,2,5,France,"Thank you. Wish everyone a good morning colleagues. Thank you to the panelists for their presentations. 2 quick questions that may be linked. First of all, chiefly towards Madam Raja Gopalan. You showed that there were similarities between certain outer space activities Co orbital activities of certain states. More specifically, have you noted in your research? Any difference in conduct or practices with respect to those activities? Which according from what I understood from your statement that are comparable. My second question goes more to Madam Yamamoto in the guidelines that industry has managed to draft and approve and that you presented. I'd like to get your take. Tell us about the process of developing those guidelines, of those best practices that you've set up. For example, during the drafting of the guidelines, was there any tension? Tension between commercial activities. Who were at the origin of some of those guidelines? How did you overcome that tension, those differences? So I'd like to know about the process really of drawing up those best practices, which is interesting for us today. Thank you.",2
S2M522,2,5,China,"Thank you, Sir. I'd like to thank the panelists for their presentations today. I have two questions here. Concerning the question of a commercial operators. What we are discussing here is the threats, space to space, threats by states, to space systems. But commercial operators are also deeply involved in all those activities. The most representative is that of the SpaceX. That company has started. A star link system. Under that plan, they're going to launch 40,000 satellites. Those satellites will take up a lot of resources in terms of frequency and orbits. In addition, there's commercial satellites. May also take part in armed conflicts. Therefore, I'd like to ask the panelists. How do you look at those commercial operators and their satellites which may pose some threats? The jurisdiction country of those commercial operators, What kind of responsibilities should they shoulder? My second question. Concerning the speeches of the 2nd and the 3rd panelists. The second panelist mentioned the question of laser dazzling. As a matter of fact. Laser technology is also a dual use technology. It can be used for military purposes to reduce debris. What I want to ask is. As far as the laws of a laser is concerned. For instance, we can imagine a simple scenario. Under which the satellite of state? Approximates or gets near with the malicious intentions the satellites of state B. And that country feels threatened and then goes to carry out laser dazzling to the satellite of the state aim. In such a scenario, we're going to come up with a lot of difficult legal issues. For instance. The right to self-defense? Does it apply to space? That kind of scenario occurs in real practice. The country be, Is it? Does it have the obligation to carry out previous consultations with state? And is the state A obliged to carry out consultations with state B as well? It will go further along that line. If the malicious approximation. Comes from a satellite where we don't know which country belongs to. That is to say that satellite is not registered in our system. What will be the differences in terms of legal consequences in such a situation? Moreover, during our first part of our meeting, we discussed the obligation of due regard. What kind of duty guard obligation would be imposed on state A and state B in this case? Those were some of the legal questions I'd like to ask the panelists. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.",2
S2M524,2,5,Germany,I'd like to thank all the panelists for their very insightful remarks and ask one question to Miss Ivamoto 1 theme that came up in our previous discussions in these work in this working group was the idea to derive threats from deviations of usual patterns of behaviors or norms such as rules of the road for space if something exists. So our question is based on what you described on the efforts and confers and other fora in a way to come up with. What standards for rendezvous and proximity operations? Is industry already at a point where they could in a way describe in 3-4 sentences? Characteristics of napio which which are so deviating from from a norm that it can be considered as threatening or responsible to operators of a satellite. Thank you.,2
S2M526,2,5,Russia,"Thank you, Chairman. First of all, let me thank the panelists for their presentations. And just ask literally 2 questions. First question is for Madam Rajagopalan. No, we heard rather detailed information, including on the space activities carried out by the Russian Federation. To be honest, we listened, studied, we listened with interest to that information. And we think Madam Rajagopalan seems to know more than the Russian delegation. On the outer space activities of our country. Therefore, it's very interesting for us to know what sources Raja Gopalan used. When? Writing her report. Also how? How was the the credibility of those sources assessed? Second question goes to all the panelists. Chiefly to In fact, there was an emphasis placed in the reports on. Specific systems. But a number of systems that we think. Pose risks and threats in the context of outer space activities were ignored. Therefore, we would like to ask all the panelists. Regarding their opinion of. Risks and threats posed by Anti missile? Anti missile anti Ballistic. Missile systems located in outer space. What's your evaluation of the risks posed by such systems? We'd also like to get your assessment of the risk and threats posed by. Systems. Of. Particle beam weaponry.",2
S2M528,2,5,The Islamic Republic of Iran,"Mr. Chair, thank you for the floor and also thank you to the distinguished panelists regarding the fact that detection, tracking and tracing space to space threats demands online monitoring of space as well as space situational awareness or SSA, and regarding the fact that the capability and technology of space online monitoring. Is available in a limited number of countries. What mechanism do you propose for online sharing of information to be indiscriminately, indiscriminately made accessible to all developing countries and to the benefits of all people, irrespective of the vickrey of their economic or scientific development? Thank you.",2
S2M530,2,5,Switzerland,"Thank you. Thank you to the whole team for organizing this very interesting round table. Thank you to all. The panelists. Our question concerns rendezvous and orbit close approach operations, which we think it's crucial to take all steps possible in terms of transparency and. And safety. My question refers to. I've got two questions. One is on identification of the object that's being approached. The capacity for SSA are significant in such cases and not all countries have those capacities. For that reason international cooperation. Plays a very important role when it comes to SSA's, and I'd like to ask the panelists their opinion on how to bolster that cooperation. And a collaborative SSA system. Could such a collaborative system be established? My second question. Second question. With respect to transparency efforts and in particular prior notification of give of RPO maneuvers here, what do you recommend in terms of? Channels of communication. To be used, is it better to use traditional bilateral channels or could something else be set up? Under the auspices of the UN, for example, what are your recommendations on that regard? Thank you.",2
S2M532,2,5,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. We thank the panelists for their very rich discussion this morning. Our question is for Miss Ortega of Unidere. In our joint, In the joint Philippine Germany paper, we mentioned that security threats are understood to be acute harmful effects of deliberate actions. In this sense, deliberate action is regardless of any intention. And in your presentation you discuss dual use of objects, future use and current function. Would you say that on both times there can be a deliberate action? That will be considered as a security threat. Thank you.",2
S2M534,2,5,The Observer Research Foundation,"OK. Thank you. Yeah, thank you and great questions from the delegates. So the first question on the from our French delegate on the similarities between the kind of activities that we have seen so far. I would say that the currently the RPO close maneuver activities that have been undertaken demonstrated by the three countries I talked about in my presentation are consistent with non offensive utilities which are primarily essentially for on orbit satellite servicing, close inspection circling. But each of these countries do have the capability to. Effectively develop these capabilities into an effective Co orbital ASAP capability should they have a decision. So these states may not have a declared cooperative ASAP program at this stage, but the RPO capability, RPO experiments that they have been doing for now for a while now for more than a decade, these can be upgraded or evolved into a Co orbital SAT program. But in terms of maybe the US has the most sophisticated system, but I think Russia is not far behind when it comes to the sophistication of some of these capabilities. China is rapidly. Ramping up their as well. So in terms of the capabilities I think they are fairly solid in terms of their ability to convert them into a corporate Co orbital ASAP program. Question from Chinese, Chinese delegate on the. Yeah, very quickly I want to respond, I think it's mostly to Aya, but I think threats from commercial actors, I mean that's something that has been particularly concerning to a lot of the non Western countries because commercial actors participating in the space business has been predominantly a Western phenomena in essence, mostly this has been happening in the Western countries context whether it is in the US. Or European context. Asia or other parts of the world have not had too many of the commercial actors taking up playing a big role in commercial space activity in the space programs of various countries. These programs have been by and large done run by state agencies and therefore there has been certain amount of hesitation to let the commercial actors take a big role in in determining the rules of the road and so on and so forth. But I think this is also changing quite rapidly. China itself, for instance, has a sizeable number of commercial actors from startups to medium sized enterprise, small and medium sized enterprises, as well as big players engaged in commercial activities countries and other countries in Asia, whether it is Japan, India and Singapore and a lot of other countries. This is a phenomenon that is changing. So I think this is going to become a reality. And commercial players also are important in the context of setting this to setting the rules of the road, setting standards and so on and so forth. So they inevitably will have. A bigger role in in developing global governance mechanisms. Thank you for a question from our Russian delegate. Thank you. I was just trying to put together a lot of information that is available in open source. My information is purely from open source open sources. I did not have any sort of classified sources of information that I have used in this. In my presentation, these have been mostly taken from. I think there are a few agencies that have been putting out together putting out counter space threats globally. The Secular World Foundation, you have the CSI Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. Both of these think tanks in Washington DC have been putting together information, collating information on all the counter space capabilities that have been developed over the over the decades. In a sense those are very those are proven to be very valuable piece of information. But I also used other credible academic as well as official reports from. From open sources, so. There is nothing that that have been used. There's no classified information that I've used to suggest that I may have had more information from our own Russian delegation. A couple of very quick points on the SSA. Iran had raised at Western, but I think Switzerland, our delegates question also collaborative. SSA can be established. Yes, SSA at this point of time is available only with a small number of countries. the United States has the largest SSA coverage in terms of their radars and other networks. But I think Russia comes fairly close with a particularly good coverage of the Southern hemisphere. Other countries that are developing effective capabilities include China, India, Japan and so on and so Australia. So there are I think the possibility or the requirement for a collaborative SSC cannot be emphasized enough. And the SSA is a relatively non controversial area in some sense when you look at it because at the end of the day having information on the space environment that you operate. And he's going to be beneficial to you as well as to all the other players in space. So can this be done? But it's it stands out as an area that should be sort of up for grabs by every country. But I think we still have had some political issues because of it. We haven't made much progress even among like-minded partners at this point of time. Dealing with the Rpos channels of communication, what should we do with bilateral route or something else? I think this is something that can states on certain standards. For instance, what is to say? I think this is Peter was talking about it earlier. Also what's a safe distance to undertake RPO for instance and close manuals? Whether it is among the friendly nations or even among non friendly. Assets and so on and so forth. And especially if it is an accidental case or an unintentional activity, but you have bumped into a certain certain. Satellite or very close proximity with another satellite, can we at least come up to institute certain measures or standard operating procedures, Sops in terms of conveying the information to the other party that this is what has happened. This is not an intentional act, but I think those challenges of communications have become extremely important. So identifying the POC, the point of contact Other countries, it's only the state space agencies or are they going to be other? Departments that might be more relevant in taking up these kind of issues. I think these are the fact that we haven't had much conversation among state parties with the recent CD in Geneva or other platforms on how we regulate Rpos and kind of those kind of activities on our big satellite and service activities. That's a huge lacquin a that's something that needs to be addressed at the earliest. Let me stop here and thank you everyone.",2
S2M536,2,5,Unidir,"Thank you, Chair and thank you to all the delegates for the questions. I will focus on three. Firstly, the question posed by the delegate of China. On the interrelation between commercial actors and states, what responsibilities should states shoulder? I would like to remind the delegates that under the Outer Space Treaty, specifically Article 6, states are responsible for the activities of their nationals, which includes non governmental entities such as commercial operators. So that is why the role of states in space is so important and to prevent problems rising up from the increased. Activity of commercial operators. It's very important for states to have very robust domestic regulations to regulate commercial space activities. On the issue of laser dazzling, I agree it is a dual use, but it can also be a dual purpose type of technology. The Chinese delegate also asked whether the right of self-defense would apply to space. My opinion is that yes, absolutely, as under Article Three of the Outer Space Treaty, international law, including the the UN Charter, applies to space and the right of cell defence is enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. The obligation to carry out consultations, Unfortunately, it's not really an obligation, it's not mandatory for states to carry out consultations. Have the option under Article 9 to do so. If they believe that the activity of a specific state is going to cause some sort of harmful interference, they can either propose that consultation speed carried out if their activity could be the source of that harmful interference, or on the other hand, if they believe that somebody else's activities could be harmful, cause harmful interference. They can ask for the consultations, but these are not mandatory and the results of the consultations also do not force states to act one way or the other. So that's important to bear in mind. Then I will move on to the question posed by the delegate of the Philippines on whether the deliberate action that could where there is a deliberate action. In the case of dual use of dual purpose objects, that could be considered a security threat. I think in the case of dual purpose objects, perhaps it's more obvious that yes indeed there could be certain deliberate actions such as that repurposing that I was speaking about repurposing the capabilities to harm another object. I think that could be a very clear example. Of something that is a security threat and it's, you know, it's it is a deliberate action. I think when it comes to dual use it's it's a bit trickier. Perhaps in the context of unarmed conflict on Earth? Certain actions by dual use objects in in supporting one side or the other of a conflict could. Mean that there is some sort of breach of neutrality, for example of the laws of neutrality and that could constitute. A security threat for one of the belligerent involved in the conflict. But again, I think it's it's trickier to identify in the case of dual dual use. Then my last remark will be to answer the question by the delegate of Switzerland. Switzerland bench and ask about. Transparency and notification of certain space activities, such as movement of satellites. And if we would recommend opening. Bilateral or multilateral channels, I think the two possibilities are both good. We. There's a treaty to register satellites. Placed in outer space. And we need to make sure that information becomes public. That's very important and that's a multilateral mechanism. But also bilateral communication also can be very important. When we speak of a specific activity that will affect. One specific country.",0
S2M538,2,5,The Czech Academy of Science,"Thank you, Chair. I will try to be very brief. I wanted just to mention that the scenario mentioned by the Chinese delegation on a rendezvous situation very well highlights the need to have a rendezvous operation rules for engagement, for exchange of information because from a perspective of a of a space situation awareness or space traffic management around the operation can be very much. Viewed as a collision risk, as a safety risk and cause a de orbiting of of the initial satellite because we do not have the precise data. So I I believe that this is a very crucial thing to get a better understanding of what are the rules of rendezvous operations and what are the rules of engagement to ensure that these activities are perceived. Within their original intent and they do not create any, you know, self-defense maneuvers and self-defense moves. But thank you very much for the time. Thank you.",2
S2M62,2,6,France,"Thank you, Chair. Good afternoon everyone once again. Thank you very much for the exchanges we had yesterday morning. Which were really excellent and which once again. Show if it was necessary to do so. The full importance of our group. We wish to point out two major areas for Food for thought. The priorities for this week and within this group are to look at possible responses to the most urgent threats. These are threats which, firstly, might have serious impacts on people's welfare. And that might cause damage to the space environment And which third lean? Might. Lead to misunderstandings or risks of uncontrolled escalation. In particular, I'd like to focus on this point. Those risks concern all societies and all states. All nations, whether they're space faring or not. The second area of our reflection is that there is a perception, a false perception that some irresponsible practices. Might provide more advantages than disadvantages. I think that we have to deconstruct that perception. Through transparency, through cooperation and through commitments such as that with regard. To direct descent anti satellite tests, which I'm going to be speaking about in more detail. France believes that these tests of direct descent destructive anti satellite tests to be one of the most urgent threats. This is a destabilising act which is irresponsible and which may provoke. Very long term effects on the space environment as well as uncontrolled risks for all space operators. These acts and tests create deliberately debris and this represents a risk to security and safety of space operations as well as hindering free access of space for all. We commend once again the American commitment and that of the States which have joined with them. We wish to make progress towards universalising. And draft resolution, the draft resolution that we will be discussing at the UN General Assembly will be a welcome first step in that regard. This subject shows the pertinence of our group, which can reach pragmatic and concrete results that are implementable. In a short time frame in order to ensure security, safety and stability for our space operations. As a whole. This is a well identified and urgent risks. And we think that from this unilateral step, we can move towards universalization and perhaps a legally binding instrument, which is part of the mandate of this group. I will be speaking a second time on subject #3 under the rules that you've outlined. Chair. Thank you.",0
S2M64,2,6,Brazil,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, the Delegation of Brazil wishes to thank you for convening yesterday yesterday's panel which, besides addressing current and future threats by States to space systems, managed to shed some light into the perspective of Latin American and the Caribbean region in the current debate. To add to this afternoon's exchange of ideas, I am glad to refer to Brazil's national contribution to do UNSG Report Document A/76/77, which touched on existing and potential threats to space systems, as well as on responsible, irresponsible and threatening behaviors in outer space. As far as existing and potential threats to space systems are concerned, I will list a few in a non exhaustive fashion. The development and proliferation of new anti satellite weapon systems, either terrestrial or Co orbital. Conducting maneuvers are proximity operations without previous warning. Rendezvous activities among satellites in space, raising suspicions about the existence of espionage or data collection missions, creating an environment of MISTRESSED, and the possible adoption of response measures by states that claim to have had their satellites observed without prior notification. Failure to register satellites and the absence of information and the use of spatial objects with low visibility characteristics or with steel technology. Taking control of space objects into accepting information or taking measures that put other satellites at risk. Cyber operations against space capabilities in orbit are on land that pose a threat to critical infrastructures, both for military and civilian purposes. When it comes to responsible, irresponsible and threatening behavior in outer space, Brazil is fully committed to the confidence building and transparency measures TCBMS established by the 2013 DGE report. Brazil also favors the discussion on the subject in such a way as to make space activities both in orbit and on Earth more transparent, and to improve communications between technicians, operation operators and authorities concerned. Mr. Chairman. Pre launch notifications, registrations of space objects, exchange of information about the intentions of a particular operation, as well as the improvement of SSAS are measures constantly recognized as responsible. In line with the report of the 2013 GGE endorsed by the UNGA by consensus through resolution A slash res Res Slash 68/50. In this sense, Brazil considers the following behaviors as responsible. Registering satellite objects as recommended by the registration convention. Prior or timely communication communicating maneuvers with space objects aimed at avoiding damage or interference to space device in other states. Maximizing the use of the orbiting devices and satellites or the removal of parts or components of space vehicles. At the end of the life site lifecycle of each space element reducing the amount of space debris. Sharing information on the monitoring of objects in space in order to feed international databases. And to enable broad spatial situation awareness. Submitting international notifications on the possibility of collisions involving uncontrolled space objects or the orbit withdrawals. Establishing an international commitment aimed at banning tests with Anti Satellite Weapons ACT weapons. Observing the principles and precepts of the Outer Space Treaty. The Astronaut agreement, the Liability Convention and the Registration Convention. Observing the 21 guidelines on the Long term sustainability of outer space activities. Established by copious and adopted by consensus by the UN, Georgia. This list above is of a non exhaustive nature. Mr. Chair. Conducting tests of satellite destruction capabilities. Use of anti satellite weapons. Performing electronic attacks, jamming and spoofing or cyber attacks on space systems. Refraining from carrying out anti collision maneuvers between satellites are not communicating to other states about potential collisions involving satellites, mainly under the international their international registration. Not the orbiting space systems at the end of their life cycle or employing nuclear reactors in Earth's orbit in disagreement with the guidelines and principles recommended by the Technical and Scientific Subcommittee of copies are considered irresponsible behaviors. In addition to them, there are a number of behaviors that can be characterized as threatening, such as those mentioned in the following non exhaustive list. Developing direct assent or Co orbital and the satellite weapons. Executing proximity maneuvers between satellites without prior communication and understanding between the states of registration of space objects. Developing satellites equipped with armaments, sensors for electronic or cyber attacks. And using anti satellite capabilities to carry out any destruction of satellites in orbit, resulting in intentional creation of space de bees. Thank you Mr. Chair.",0
S2M66,2,6,Australia,"Thank you very much, Chair. Internationally agreed norms of responsible behaviours are essential in ensuring the continued sustainability of the space domain for the peaceful use of all nations. This is important for our quality of life on earth and for enhancing economic opportunities for all nations. Australia is concerned about Earth to space behaviors that jeopardize freedom of access to space, endanger the piloted or unpiloted space systems of other nations, or put the peaceful and free use of space at risk. Australia was pleased to provide a submission to the Secretary General's report on states views on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors. We offered initial thoughts on 10 potential principles for reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors, including risk reduction, transparency and confidence building measures. One of these potential principles related to the commitment not to undertake activities that deliberately or foreseeably created long lived debris fields. As the panelists noted in yesterday's session, Orbital Debris puts all states freedom of access to space at risk. Particularly those with nascent space enterprises. Australia views the intentional, reckless or negligent generation of long lived debris fields as a significant threat to the space domain. Some of Earth to space behaviours such as destructive direct descent anti satellite missile testing can be viewed by other states as a threatening act in addition to their potential to produce large amounts of debris. In this regard, the US commitment not to conduct such tests is important and we hope to have more to say on this in the coming weeks and months. The Australian Government is committed to supporting the international community in addressing the problem of space debris generated from all vectors, including Earth to space activities. We call on all states to consider transparency and confidence building measures relating to the generation of orbital debris. We note the panelists yesterday emphasised domestic regulation as being important part of Australia's civil space legislation. The Space Launches and Returns Act of 2018 introduced A requirement that approval of certain launch activities, namely Australian launch permits and overseas payload permits, include a debris mitigation strategy. As the global economy and society becomes more dependent on space systems, it is incumbent upon all nations to act responsibly and transparently in space and consider the risk to space assets of other nations when undertaking activities in outer space. We look forward to working with the international community to further enhance our collective space situational awareness capabilities to ensure the ongoing viability of the space domain. Thank you, Chair.",0
S2M68,2,6,Philippines,"You're the first, Sir, Mr. Chair. Thank you again for your invaluable efforts to put a structure to our discussions. In our earlier intervention, we characterized current conditions that, to our view, constitute security risks in the context of outer space. These include insufficient understanding of mutual threat perceptions. States assess the degree of their dependence on species stems, for instance, in terms of national security or economic relevance. Differently, such differences lead to divergent threat perceptions. A lack of understanding of the kind of behaviors that another state deems threatening or escalatory could lead to an increased risk of escalation. In this context, we welcome this opportunity to present our views on how we perceive current and future Earthy space threats by states to space systems. Our contribution to this conversation is not meant to be prescriptive. Our goal is to help enrich discussions, particularly on understanding of threat perceptions. The Philippines Space Act, the national legislation that provides the overarching mandate for our space program identifies 6 key development areas or Kdas, that underpin our space program and underline the importance of our space based assets. These Kdas are mostly framed in the context of our sustainable development plans. Which is an important consideration in defining our national security objectives for the Philippines. Therefore, any deliberate action that led to the harmful effects and the safe operations of our modest space based assets, the long term sustainability of outer space. The provision is K space based services to the public and the use of relevant national security and space based services constitute threats. This is true whether the harmful effects of such deliberate actions are intentional. Or unintentional. Actual or potential? Given our limited space awareness capabilities and upstream space assets, the vulnerability of national spacefaring states like the Philippines are particularly acute. Among the relevant threats to our modest space assets is the presence of space debris. In its jointly statement delivered on the first day of the second session of this, OEWGA, Sayan called for action to mitigate the effects of space debris. The Philippines fully support or fully aligns with the science call. In this context, the Philippines believe that any deliberate or intentional debris creating action could constitute a security threat. It is in this context that we are concerned about the testing of the requisite anti satellite missiles. We note the expressions of commitment of several states not to conduct such testing as a welcome demonstration of responsible behavior. Further, the destruction of or irreversible damage of satellites result in disruption of crucial services that could have destabilizing social and economic impact. Thereby constituting an acute national security concern. This includes damage or destruction caused by interferences, including by cyber or electromagnetic means. These interferences limit the capability of space assets to provide critical services, including in the context of Disaster Risk Reduction and response, which are crucial to climate vulnerable countries like the Philippines. In our working Paper #17, the Philippines and Germany identified irresponsible and threatening behavior in outer space. The Philippines hopes to start the conversation around these behaviors with the view to developing common understandings that would inform our work to develop norms that support a predictable and rules based governance regime covering outer space. We wish to under score that these threats do not necessarily arise from capabilities which are themselves value neutral. For the Philippines, the most important factor is behavior. It is in this context that we continuously call on all states uphold the legal obligation of jury guard. Under Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty. We consider the duty of Jury guard as a foundational principle of responsible behavior in outer space, and we encourage this group to continue its conversation To further unpack this principle, We have provided our views on this in our working People #12 Upholding the duty of Jury Guard entails the responsible behavior that takes into account the interests of other States and the international community as a whole. These include but not, but is not limited to, ensuring transparency and exploring means to operationalize the optional provisions. Of consultations under the Outer Space Treaty. The Philippines will continue to be engaged actively in our collective work in this regard. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M610,2,6,Switzerland,"Mussular President Chair. Thank you for giving me the floor. We would like to thank you for having put this topic of threats to space systems coming from the Earth on our agenda. And we would like to also thank the panelists who took part. In the panel yesterday morning. We would also like to thank you, Nadir and the permanent mission of Australia for having organized yesterday at the beginning of the afternoon, a round table on diversity. We support inclusivity in work aiming to promote space security. Chair. The routes to space systems coming from the Earth are linked to deliberate actions. Which can have different forms of impact. Potentially they can disrupt access to essential services provided by space Services. They can also undermine the long term sustainability of space activities, in particular through creating debris. Finally, they can also pose a threat to global security if there are attacks made against military satellites. For all, for example, early warning missile systems. The most immediate concern related to threats to. Space systems coming from the Earth. Is. And director sent ASAP. This concern is linked to the fact that several states have are developing and have already tested such weapons. Our concern is also linked. To the fact that these weapons would generate debris. The consequences of these tests will have an impact on the long term sustainability of space activities and in this context we would like to make the following points. We commend these statements made with regard to renouncing any asset tests where these weapons have destructive effects. We call on all states, in particular countries who have tested ASAT or who have the capacity. Capacities of this nature to join in with this moratorium. This has been highlighted. It is not just about curbing any test of this nature, but also. To. And in fact, fully prohibit them in this context, as we've already stressed yesterday. We should closely look at the. That have imposed on the use of force in space by international public law and international humanitarian law, in particular when it comes to the principles of proportionality and distinction. Given the dual nature of many space systems and the difficulty of limiting the effects of certain types of attacks in space. Most military attacks in space would probably be already prohibited under IHL. As the panelists highlighted yesterday morning. Direct descent. Weapons are not the only threat coming from the Earth posed to space systems. There are other. Potential forms of interference. Against those system when we speak about electronic and cybernetic capabilities. Which are all so important to consider. If these capabilities do not necessarily cause permanent physical damage, they might temporarily cease services, essential services, or affect their reliability. Damage them or make them fully inoperable. This would have consequences in particular for the least developed countries. As the panelist Victoria, stated yesterday. Using such capabilities might have severe consequences. A state who sees its systems targeted by such capabilities might be led to respond. To counter such an attack. And this could potentially occur in space. Satellite which is rendered inoperable through the use of such capabilities non destructive capabilities. Would become uncontrollable. It would represent a threat to space security. It could in itself create much debris. Observation military satellites or early warning satellites which are targeted by laser on the Earth might be rendered inoperable and it might raise questions. There will be significant challenges to global security that would result from that in particular. When we speak about those satellites related to nuclear purposes. The possible recourse to such capabilities. Should retain our full attention because these capabilities are becoming. More and more accessible, financially and technologically, they might rapidly proliferate. Finally, the. Of some of them are more difficult to detect and to attribute. Switzerland shares the opinion that was stated yesterday that it's important to strengthen the application of transparency. And confidence building measures and to develop notification systems and to increase. Space awareness. It seems to us to be crucial that we boost international cooperation in these areas. Chair, thank you very much.",0
S2M612,2,6,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. China believes that the Earth to space threats constitute only one aspect of the various threats to the outer space environment and outer space systems and should not be viewed in isolation. These threats have their root causes in the decisions and actions taken by 1 country on the earth and on the ground, and they are manifested in the following specific ways. The 1st is its adoption on the ground of an irresponsible and offensive space policy. As China said in a statement yesterday or the day before yesterday, the OEWG cannot turn a blind eye to or remain idle to the policy threats arising from the policies, doctrines and strategies pursued by a certain space varying power and superpower aimed at achieving space dominance and space hegemony. If a country defines outer space as a war fighting domain and a priority domain of national military power, if it continues to improve its space force structure, conducts military exercises, and advocate confrontation in outer space, the risk that this country may deploy weapons in outer space, or may use or threaten to use force against outer space objects would certainly increase, endangering the world and causing the strong concern of the international community. The second is the direct threat to the security and safety of space objects through activities on the ground. For example, conducting asset tests from land, sea and air based platforms using electromagnetic interference and cyber attacks from earth to interfere with other countries launch activities. And disrupted normal trajectory of space objects. The third is the development of anti satellite capabilities under the banner of missile defense. On Monday, the scholar from Japan mentioned that missile defense systems could be used for direct asset asset. This is a important point. Anti satellite and anti missile technologies are interrelated. While anti missile weapons may appear to be for offensive for defensive purposes, they can also be offensive means posing a serious threat to space objects and creating long term debris in outer space. During the interactive segment yesterday morning, some experts made special reference to the SM3 missile launched in 2008. Which destroy a satellite and create large amounts of debris. The country concerned also jointly develops with its allies anti missile weapons which are transferred to a European and Asian Pacific regions, thus deliberately creating proliferation of the asset capabilities. When we discuss Earth to space threats, we should not overlook or exclude the missile defense capability which can be used for asset purpose, Mr. Chairman. In our statement on Monday, we stated our overall and general views on US commitment about not to conduct destructive direct assent anti satellite missile testing. China also noted that U.S. officials have indicated that they would submit a trial resolution to the GA on this issue calling on other countries to make similar commitments. I'd like to reiterate that China welcomes all arms control initiative that are genuinely conducive to the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. But is firmly against any practice of trying to expand one's own military superiority in the name of arms control. Historically, the United States is the country that has conducted the earliest, the most numerous and most comprehensive anti satellite testing. As early as 1959, only two years after the launch of the first artificial satellite, the US had already embarked on its Direct Ascent Anti satellite missile testing. The tests conducted by the US have not only resulted in serious damage to the outer space environment and outer space systems, but have also directly intensified confrontation and arms race between major powers. After more than half a century's development, the US now possesses full-fledged asset measures and is capable to build its operational asset capability through its missile defense systems. That is, without the need for destructive direct ascent anti satellite missile testing. It is rather ironic for the United States, a country which is most enthusiastic in developing offensive and defensive space capabilities, to put forward a job resolution on this issue. If the United States is genuinely committed to security and safety of after space, it should have submitted such a resolution 60 years ago. As far as the commitment made by the US is concerned. The commitment does not involve the development, production, deployment of assets. Nor does it impose restrictions or constraints on the US space force build up. To put it in a nutshell, it has no added value to promoting international arms control endeavor on outer space. Yesterday, a high-ranking officer of the US Space Force when testifying in the Senate Armed Services Committee said this. I quote we don't give up too much because we have other ways to test our capabilities. End of quote. In view of the the following, we have to point out that the US initiative is 1 sided as it contains no restriction on the self and from an arms control point of view the initiative has very little if any practical value. Mr. Chairman, the fundamental way to address the earth to space threats is to discard the offensive space policy. The most powerful space fair in country has the primary responsibility towards negotiating a legal instrument on arms control in outer space and should play an active and leading role in this regard. Since China and Russia submitted the draft PPWT to the CD, some countries have repeatedly attacked the draft, yet they have never submitted any treaty draft on arms control in outer space or any other such substantial proposals to the CD. Some argued that the PPWT puts control on weapons and does not regulate the behavior of states. This is a deliberate misinterpretation of the PPWT. In fact, the PPWT's prohibition of deployment of weapons in outer space and commitment on not to use or threaten to use force against space objects are all about behaviors. It is capable of covering all the issues discussed by this OEWG, including, of course, an effective solution to the asset question. We call on the countries concerned to join the negotiation process with a responsible attitude and as soon as possible, so that all kinds of threats, including Earth to space threats, can be addressed in a legally binding way and the peace and tranquility in outer space can be preserved. Mr. Chairman, in order to find and once and for all solution to the Earth to space threats, China would like to suggest that the OEWG should include the following three points in the subsequent discussions of rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior. The first point all countries should confirm that war in outer space could never be won and must never be fought. No country should seek hegemony in outer space or adopt A strategy and policy with the aim to dominate outer space. No country should consider outer space as a war fighting domain. Second, all countries should make a commitment in a legally binding manner on not to use or threaten to use force against outer space objects. 3rd All countries should commit themselves to negotiating at an early date and international and legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in and weaponization of outer space. Mr. Chairman. Yesterday, we listened carefully to the statements made by Sri Lanka, Cuba, India and Indonesia, all of which stressed the importance of international law and considered that. And consider that the discussion in the OEWG should be based on clear legal concepts and definitions. Rather, they have stated the importance of of achieving arms control through international law. That's just the importance of achieving arms control in space through international law. They all considered that the discussions in the OEWG should be based on clear legal concepts and meaning. China shares this view. During the first session, delegations did not reach agreement on legal issues and there was not sufficient discussions on the aspect of international law. If the OEWG were to start discussing a code contact at this time. And this way of working would itself be irresponsible. We need to seriously consider this possibility. And there will be a eventuality that an arbitrary interpretation of international law will occur. Especially the existing international law. Therefore, we believe it is important for the OEWG to continue to look into the relevant legal issues. To identify the existing gaps in the current international legal system. And as well as consider the applicability of various legal concepts, including the concept of due regard in various scenarios. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",4
S2M614,2,6,Netherlands,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for allowing me to come back on topic 2. A sotated floor For the first time, I would like to commend you and your team for your diligent work done in the scope of the OWG and by providing us with such an insightful and substantive program for the OWG Sessions. You can count on the full support of our delegation to make this open-ended working Group A success. Our designation also extends our heartfelt condolences to the distinguished delegation of the United Kingdom because of the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the 2nd. Mr. Chair, this morning and the days before, we have heard a number of threats from Earth to space that have a multitude of origins. These threats cannot only impact spacefaring nations across the globe. But an even larger number of users of space services as well. This may endanger numerous, very often critical economic, social, scientific and security related applications. We can therefore not limit ourselves to identify and address a single root cause of these threats. Nor work on A1 size fits all solution. Instead, contributions from various stakeholders in this process, which we have heard so far, show us that the step by step approach is possible. That addresses the different threads in directed ways. Mr. Threats from the ground, from the ground to space, such as direct Ascend anti satellite systems, continue to be a matter of great concern to the Netherlands. Current proposals for legally binding measures do not sufficiently address these threats. This is among the underlying reason that the Netherlands cannot support these initiatives at this moment. It is a positive development that ground based threats have been included in the United Nations General Assembly resolution of further practical measures for the prevention of an arms race in outer space. In this regard, the Netherlands welcomed the commitment announced by the United States not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti satellite missile tests. And welcome similar commitments made by other UN Member states that have been expressed thereafter. To us, this initiative is an example of a practical measure to prevent an arms race in outer space. And an act of responsible behavior in space. This unilateral commitments and the potential for multilateralization via the draft resolution on direct ascent and etcetera, tests that the delegation of the United States announced yesterday. For my timely and constructive further step to reduce this threat of force against outer space objects. Add further discussions to enshrine these in eventually legally binding instruments. Especially in light of real life developments such as the deliberate and unnecessary creation of space debris through the destruction of cosmos Fourteen O 8 by a direct descent and the satellite missile. And the subsequent and ongoing consequences of this irresponsible act to outer space users. Thank you.",0
S2M616,2,6,Israel,"Presidente, Thank you very much, Chair. First and foremost, because this is the first time that my delegation is taking the floor, I would like to thank you heartily for the very effective way in which you've been guiding our discussion. And the way you've been guiding the work of this group in recent days, like to join others in conveying Israel's condolences to the people of the UK on the death of the of Queen Elizabeth the Second, who has left behind an unparalleled legacy of leadership and service. In addition, we would like to convey through you our gratitude to all the panelists who participated in our discussions this week. Going back to the past weeks fruitful discussions, it is obvious that space has become a very dominant and essential domain in daily life of humanity. Economics, trade, telecommunications, transportation and even agriculture and medical research are all part of this. We share the view that space is crucial for the benefits and interest of all humanity. Therefore, we see value in the informative and professional presentations during the last few days regarding the risks, hazards and threats on the space domain. The time of which might affect critical systems on Earth and might cause harm to people, property, and inhibit safety on Earth. As presented earlier this week, we as well support further discussions regarding developing space. Domain awareness is a practical and valuable action that can assure improving safety and security in space. Finally, we hope that this week's discourse will focus on the complex concepts, attend and promote a common understanding of this important issue, Much of glaciers and your president. Thanks again, Chair.",1
S2M618,2,6,The Republic of Korea,"Thank you, Chair. On topic two, I would like to once again reiterate my delegations view that destructive direct ascent and desatellite missile testing is one of the most significant threats for much space as it creates long lived space debris and can endanger satellites or human lives in space. In this regard, the ROK expresses its great concern against the destructive anti satellite missile test carried out last November. This test created a near immediate debris field of over 1500 objects according to US Space Command, and likely hundreds of thousands of smaller pieces of debris that are unable to be constantly tracked. The debris field is so serious that astronauts on the International Space Station had to shelter in place. Immediately after the test with this assessment, we welcome once again the US commitment not to conduct these tests and welcome the relay of such commitments in the international community, including by Japan and Germany. This week we also thank the US delegation for suggesting a draft resolution on the very subject to be discussed at the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The ROK believes that it is important to understand the threats associated with acid missile testing and This is why we supported the development of an infographic on anti satellite weapons and space sustainability. Published in June, which is available through the Secure World Foundation website. We also have some copies of that infographic at the back of the room for those who wish to take a look. We hope that this infographic would help raise awareness of the relevant actors. On another note, non kinetic physical attacks and electronic attacks to space systems is are another are other areas that we believe weren't further attention of the international community. Lasers and uplink jammers in particular can directly or indirectly result in damages in space systems and the RK government believes that this would negatively affect the security of space systems. Such application, as we see, should fall under the category of irresponsible behavior. Thank you, Chair.",0
S2M620,2,6,The Islamic Republic of Iran:18,"Mr. Chairman, well, actually our statement is not exactly inconsistent with the topic that you are going to discuss. We generally discuss the issues of threat to space. Of course, we refer to the topics that you have. Structured for discussion mostly for the panel discussion, Mr. Chairman. At the outset, I would like to welcome you back to the chair of the second meeting of the EWG. To facilitate comprehensive exchange of views on norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior and develop convergence on the basis of consensual collective wisdom so as to contribute to achieving the goal of prevention of an armed race in outer space. We also thank the Secretariat for preparing this second meeting. We likewise thank different panelists for their insightful discussions. Mr. Chair, we have carefully studied your summary of the discussion of the first meeting under your own responsibility. We, along some other delegations, have noticed that the Chair summary have not reflected the views and positions of. Our group, as properly as it should we, we are group of countries that have substantively difficulty with the so-called concept of responsible behavior. As a standard norm to substitute or delay the negotiation of a legal binding instrument for Paris, which is long-awaited mandate of the Conference on Disarmament. We note that all states participating in this first session have been engaged in serious and substantive discussions. In the spirit of all to be considered, Mr. Chair has already respected the views of those against the norm, sitting as responsible or responsible, irresponsible instead of legal norms, and indicated that he would consider their views. That is why this group of countries sponsored a statement mentioned. Chair Somebody should have been considering their views accordingly. Mr. Chair, the growing development of technologies, the incremental rising of conflicts in outer space and the activities of some governments to dominate and seek superiority in a space has has revealed the inadequacy of existing international legal instrument in the face of new challenges to maintain the security of outer space. And promote its peaceful use and exploration. More states are widely and deeply involved in space activities, and some private actors also involved are also involved in a space launch activities and space applications and have been merged with combating a space system due to the increasing number of stakeholders in the use of outer space and the growing dependence on human life on the benefit of the outer space applications Maintaining stable outer space. It's peaceful and secure, becomes more vital than ever before. It remains as elusive as before. That international community is still faces security challenges and threats arising from the ever increasing weaponization and militarization of outer space. The Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its well known position that the outer space is the common province of all humankind and the exploration and use of which must be for the benefit of all nations and should remain the domain of peaceful activities and international cooperation. It is now more compelling than before that the prevention of an armed race in outer space known as porous remains as high priority security agenda for the international community at large to negotiate illegal binding instrument in the conference on this armament. These long-awaited mandate of the city should not be converted to a fundamentally oversimplified political agenda and subject current risky and dangerous military activities and weaponizations of outer space. To a dichotomy of distinction between responsible and irresponsible behaviors in outer space. As my delegation said in the first meeting, this would down grading the noble agenda of the city on Paris to negotiate a legal binding instrument. Well as the international disarmament agenda, the deviation from the long lasting mandate of the city and Paris to negotiate a legal, binding instrument for the full, effective and non discriminatory prevention of arm race in outer space is no more pressing and urgent than ever before. The legally binding instrument based on sovereign equality of all states as fundamental principle of international law can complement the space law and fill the legal gaps and continue and contribute to reducing the risk and threats of an armed race in space. We have given our opinion of why why the discussion of responsible behavior is intrinsically political agenda which eventually is divisive. And ultimately in the absence of legal binding instrument for Paris will end up with the situation where some group of states. Would postulate themselves in an arbitrary manner to judge about others behaviors. In our working paper as our contribution to this second session in this working paper, we have explained that the so-called concept of irresponsible behavior might be an attractive, just political gesture, but it is subjective, oversimplified, vague and unclear phrase to define norm setting as a standard for. Appropriate behavior. For political act that complying with it is driven by political expectations. Because norms are usually being set instead of law based on expectations, They are easier to adapt to a political situation or situations of a particular state or states who are against the pursuit of legal legal agreement to keep the flexibility, for example in case of outer space to follow freely their national superiority and hegemony in outer space. This is new gesture to bypassing the CD Paris mandate. This is why we are not convinced that behavioural approach. Is the right way forward to pave the way for negotiating a legal binding instrument, as it's claimed by some of our interlocutors in this OWG characterization of behaviors through norms instead of legal agreements, as past experience has shown, would become a tool for some countries to evade their responsibility and put the blame on others. It creates idle ideological bias, double standard. Political division, technical barriers and abusive. Unilateral restriction as pretext to hamper the peaceful use of outer space only within the legal treaty. Ideological. Bias, double standards and unilateral sanctions, political divides and technical barriers could be abandoned and abuse of such a such pretext as security threats to hamper the peaceful use of outer space could be Hanford. It is dubious that reducing threats through by behavioural approach could be in reality more effective. And efficient, efficient response to the current space on race. The current militarization of space as severe as behavioral approach cannot overcome the challenges of space security to create common understanding among the members of international community political norms. In general, comparing to legal approaches create a lot of limitations and loopholes to effectively implemented. Such approaches are more prone to discrimination. They are subject to differing political interpretations of responsibilities. They are not viable. Way toward maintaining space security, in particular because of competitions and adversarial nature of the currents are raised in space. It would be logically dealing with the consequence instead of causes, since this session is mostly devoted to to discuss of different kinds of risk and threat to space. It should be emphasized that the risk of space to space, space to Earth as well as earth to space conflicts are high. It should be noted that space security is now more prone to tensions and preventing an arm race in outer space is the crucial precondition for peaceful safety and sustainable use of outer space. The root cause of such an arm race is that powerful state attempts to dominate outer space. The Cold War mentality and unilateral strategic advantages is yet prevailing that it authorizes space operations to dominate outer space. It pursues a strategy of space dominance and declares outer space as a war fighting domain is establishes a space force and space command and merge commercial space enterprises into their space combat systems. Moreover, space weapon tests and military exercises are frequently conducted. Military alliance were established to enhance combat readiness in a space. In addition, some other space powers established dedicated. Space to keep the military bodies to increase the capacity of space forces. Certain military political block even defined outer space as an operation domain where collective defence provisions are applicable. Such actions evidently demonstrate that the rising of risk of weaponizations of arm race in a space. These activities have exacerbated the security dilemma for other countries, in particular those that are not attached their securities to certain blocks. This is very negative trend that has impacted the global strategic stability and long term impairment of the space peace and security. In recent years a certain state as being the first country to test anti satellite weapons and creating more space debris than any other countries has increased its plan and actions to achieve military and strategic superiority to gain control of space in a space. In a hypocritical and misleading move it takes, it talks about banning the test of anti satellite missiles which is accompanied by the support of allies. Furthermore, with the integration of commercial activities to military operations, security legal challenges are expanding and as a result, hostile action against other countries are growing. In this situation, other countries even inevitably will have to take countermeasures to defend themselves and then the conflict will increase exponentially exponentially. To redress the situation, concrete steps should be taken. To preserve outer space as a realm of peace and free from hostility. This is clearly. An indicator of the fact that such tensions and hostilities cannot be reduced by norms of so-called responsible behaviour. The most urgent agenda of the international community should be to preserve space security to through reducing outer space threats and risk of military confrontation, by negotiating a legal standard legal treaty in which the rights and obligations of the state parties would be defined and preserved, thus reducing. Space to Earth and space to space threats through the development of any weapons. Military facilities and preventing the spread of space to Earth and space to space threats. Because other traits such as earth to space and Earth to Earth, will eventually occur. As if a country to be threatened from space and in response to such threats it has to defend itself to protecting its security, territorial integrity and sovereignty. This is a security dilemma no for all. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that. Crafting a legal framework for regulating obligations and right of states in outer space is now an urgent task in view of the current threats and risk to an arm race in outer space. This in this regard it is necessary to define legal responsibility of states in equal manner, so as some are not more equal than others. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.",4
S2M622,2,6,Russia,"Thank you, Chair. At the outset, we would like to apologize for the fact that we're taking the floor for a second time on Topic 2. But we would just like to provide a number of clarifications with regard to this topic and in as a whole on threats and dangers with regard to space activities. First and foremost. We would like to provide some clarification on our understanding. Of what responsible behaviour is? And what irresponsible behaviour is? I would say. Also, what is absolutely irresponsible behaviour? That behaviour will lead to irreversible consequences in the context of international. Law. As well as peaceful space activities. Yesterday we spoke about criteria, criteria for the responsible conduct of states in line with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. And if you look at the slide. You can see that we've got a green and yellow line. And this is the position of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. With regard to the fact that. Space activities must be purely peaceful in nature. Therefore. The main dividing line. Between responsible and irresponsible behavior. Is in fact. A certain factor. Of whether the action is peaceful in nature. Or whether whether the actions are carried out for peaceful purposes. And then we move towards the green smiley if that is the case. And we are on the lighter side of the force. And we maintain outer space for peaceful use for present and future generations. But on the other hand. If we conduct activities. Which are not in peaceful purposes if they are for hostile action purposes. Then here in fact we are on the right hand side of the scale and we're moving towards the. The red :). And our acts are irresponsible in nature, they are hostile in nature, and they run counter to the current norms of space law. Now with regard to the red line. And the line in the sand. With regard to what is definitely irresponsible behaviour. With regard to actions which are hostile in nature and which are not in line with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. And this line in the sand. Is placing a weapon first in space? And this dividing line. Is the so-called point of no return. With regard to responsible behaviour. In fact, this point of no return once it's crossed. Means that returning to a peaceful use of outer space. Will already be impossible. This is because. As soon as weapons are placed in space. We can forget about a peaceful use of outer space. In fact, we will be in a completely new reality. We will be in the reality of an arms race in space. We will be in the reality of armed conflicts in space. In a reality in which states? Will attempt to acquire dominance in space. Or try to compensate for the military advantages that possess or which will acquire another state may acquire, and so therefore. There will be an inevitable spiral of an arms race. A spiral of acquiring so-called strategic advantage. With regard to space activities. And this will have nothing to do. With current International Space law. And also it will have nothing to do. With any peaceful activities. For the prosperity of the whole of humanity. Next slide please. Now with regard to irresponsible behaviour. Once again, if you. Here only peaceful uses about space which is in the center of the diagram on this slide. Only that can be responsible behaviour in our view. Now when it comes to the different spirals going out from the centre in this diagram, all of these are forms of irresponsible behaviour. And they lead to difficulties in between states. They lead to tensions between them. And then you get to conflicts and an arms race. So once again, the point of no return. Is in fact somewhere between the tensions and conflicts. On the screen, and it leads, as a consequence, to an inevitable arms race in space. So therefore, all of these aspects, which are key to the maintenance of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes, are related to a socioeconomic use of space. Technical, military and political aspects. Uses of space. Socio, economic, technical, political, military aspect, uses of space, as I said. Therefore, once again, we'd like to repeat that. That. When we're considering the concept of responsible behavior that a number of states have put forward at this forum. We have to be very cautious. First and foremost, we have to be very cautious. Over the current norms of international law and we have to base ourselves completely on them and. See irresponsible behaviour as being any behavior which is not in line with the current norms of space law. And not call for those norms to be revised or to be re looked at, or for them to be substituted by any other norms. Quite the opposite. We have to look at providing additional norms of international law. Which on the one hand. Will allow us. To prevent irresponsible behavior. Related to Peaceful uses of space. And. I think that we have to turn to the Coppos platform in Vienna. With regard to. Norms aimed at preventing an arms race in space. Or any possibility of an armed conflict in space? In that case. I think we have to look at the norms which the Russian Federation has been putting forward for quite some time, as well as a number of other states who hold the same views as us. These are to do with a prohibition on the placement of weapons in space, as well as a prohibition on the use of force or the threat of force. With regard to space objects or using space objects. With regard to specific aspects related to the threat of Earth to space, Earth to space threats. As part of a list of irresponsible behaviour which we believe should be prohibited, we would highlight the following forms of behaviour which, in our view, are irresponsible. This includes creating testing. Deploying and using. Space weapons for missile defense? Or as anti satellite weapons. Also for their use against uses in the on the land or in the air. Moreover, we also. That irresponsible behaviour with regard to Earth, to space. Includes destruction. Damage. Or disrupting the normal functioning. Or changing the trajectory of flight. Or space objects of other states. As well as. Also with regard to space threats, we believe that showing assistance or encouraging other States or groups of States. Or international intergovernmental organisations or any other non governmental organisations. Including non governmental legal entities which have been established or registered or which are located in a territory which is under their jurisdiction. Or under their control. To take part in all of these activities to also be irresponsible behavior. Now with regard to the American initiative with regard to a moratorium against anti satellite missile tests. A lot has been spoken about this at the sessions of this group. A lot were spoken about this yesterday and today. A number of delegations have expressed their support for this initiative, and another group of states on the other hand. Is expressing very serious doubts over the effectiveness and the justification for such an initiative with with regard to this situation. The Russian Federation is probably part of the second group of states. We see the decision of the United States of America to conduct such a moratorium, as well as the decision of other states to join in that moratorium. To be a step in the right direction. However, it's absolutely not a completely sufficient step. In order to resolve the aim of preventing an arms race in outer space. It is a step that's very discriminatory in nature. If it's not bolstered by other measures which are universal in nature, which are aimed at resolving this issue of preventing an arms race in space. Then we think in fact it may have a negative impact with regard to strategic stability and International Security. More of a negative impact than a +1. This is because this step. Would create. Certain advantages. For a certain group of countries. They have already tested this type of weapons and. They possess quite a broad potential. Moreover. For this certain group of states. Which possesses technologies and means. To conduct the necessary tests. Thank you. They have the means to do that without carrying out such natural tests. They can use modeling systems or other technologies to do so. Therefore, we believe that we need to. Not just in Word, but indeed show an aspiration to achieve this goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. And we think the best affirmation of this would be. That a certain group of states who advocate for this moratorium. To participate in negotiations on a legally binding instrument with a guarantee that weapons not be placed in space. Or that there be a use of force, or a threat of A use of force against space objects or using space objects. We need to take upon ourselves obligations, not just not to carry out such anti satellite missile tests. But as we have been urging for quite some time. The United States of America and their allies should also take on some obligations which we have already spoken of. That they don't use space objects as a way to damage or strike any object on the ground or on the earth or in the air. That they should not create. Test and not deploy weapons in space. In order to complete any task including for anti missile defence. All fat anti satellite purposes or to be used against targets that are on the ground or in the air. Or to destroy? Systems that states already possess. This is so that we don't create the conditions in which a group of privileged states who have this type of weapon. Exists, and then there's another group of countries who don't have these means. And who aren't able to develop or test such systems are in fact in a situation in which they are at a loss. They are at a loss with regard to this privileged group of countries. Moreover. They need to take on obligations not to create, to test, to deploy and not to use space weapons. For anti missile defense. Or for anti satellite purposes. Awful use against targets on the earth or in the air. Not to destroy, not to damage, or not to disrupt the normal functioning. Or change the traitory of flight of the space objects of other states. Not to assist. Or not encourage other states or groups of states. Or international or intergovernmental organizations or any non governmental organizations including non governmental legal entities which have been created, registered or are located in a territory which is under their jurisdiction. Or control. To take part in such activities. It is only such comprehensive measures that can prevent what I've already spoken of, namely preventing the world from moving into a new reality of an arms race. Or new conflicts because otherwise. If discriminatory measures are adopted, then those measures will in fact only be provide colossal damage to International Security and stability. Such a discriminatory step which has been proposed by the USA and which has also been supported by a number of other states. Is in fact aimed at distracting the international community's attention. From the real aspirations and real aims of such a step. Which? Is what quite clearly stated in the USA is space doctrine. Namely, A renewed space strategy. And a doctrine document of the USA. As well as the recent. Directive of the USS Military with regard to space policy. Which is report #3. 310-0100. .10 apologies. And these documents that I just stated show that there is aspiration towards military dominance and superiority. And space is seen as a domain for. As a battleground, a place where? Defensive, offensive or preventive measures may be taken. Moreover. By engaging in such APR campaign. That state. Has not in fact provided a definition of anti satellite missiles. They haven't promoted to a definition of what these tests are, these anti satellite missile tests. And therefore it's not clear. Whether what's being referred to is anti missile defense, anti missile systems. Which part of this these anti satellite systems or not? We can't understand. Whether they're speaking about natural or virtual tests. Moreover, this initiative as far as we understand. Doesn't stipulate. Either a verification mechanism. Or any obligations on the further development of such systems? Or their existing anti satellite potential. Which the USA and its allies already has. As I already stated. Given all these circumstances, this measure. Will hardly be effective in the context of International Security strategic stability. And in fact. We in fact believe it's just a declarative measure which doesn't have any real practical significance. Therefore, at this current stage, we believe. That the major first task is to swiftly launch negotiations on a legally binding instrument in order to prevent an arms race in space. And we call on the USA to join in with this work. Moreover we. That true confidence building measures and true signals to the whole of the international community are important. Which? Sincere, sincere wishes of the USA and its allies with regard to preventing arms race in space. And we think that thereby Washington and its allies. Could join in with the international initiative. On non placement of weapons first in space. With regard to the draft resolution of the UN's General Assembly with regard to the US as initiative. Which much has been spoken about today. We don't know about a specific text of that resolution. So far we haven't received it. Unlike as far as we understand other states have, we would just like to say that this selective approach. In the work of the delegation of the USA. Towards Member States of the United Nations is counterproductive and it will hardly enable the achievement of a consensus based approval of that draft resolution at the first committee. The Russian Federation, at the very least, does not take such an approach. We work with all states, all member States. In order to. Reach a consensus based adoption of any initiative of the Russian Federation at the UN General Assembly. Thank you very much.",4
S2M624,2,6,Portugal,"Mr. Chair and the signals representatives. Mr. Chairman, this is the first time that the Portuguese delegation takes the floor in this session. I would like to congratulate you and your team in the way that you are conducting this session. Also, allow me to extend our condolences to the delegation of the United Kingdom on the passing away of their Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second. Mr. Chairman. Be assured that you can count on Portugal's full cooperation on these open-ended working group on reducing space rights. Further to the statement delivered earlier by the distinguished representative of the European Union on the topic one, we full support would like to convert some national points. Since the beginning of the space activity 65 years ago, the technological developments have been immense in different domains that nowadays support our way of life on the planet. On planet Earth, our fellow citizens use information provided by space data, which for them is ubiquitous and just exists for them. This this was achieved through the hard work of brilliant minds around the world, through international corporations, international treaties established having in mind the Pacific use of outer space. It is irresponsible to perform anti satellite tests that affect the space ecosystem created for the benefit of people in a way that would destroy the new, this new way of living in our own planet and destroy the future of the next generations. Portugal welcomes all the initiatives from Member States to not perform such tests. During the next decade we will see massive transformation in the space sector with new public and private actors, new international collaborations and new ways of facing space exploration. On a different note, Portugal strongly supports our common agenda proposed by the UN Secretary General and the stronger, more networked and inclusive multilateral systems anchored within the United Nations. That also encompasses the multi Stakeholder Dialogue on Outer Space for a peaceful, secure and sustainable use of Outer Space. Portugal will actively contribute to the Outer Space Dialogue and promote an international conference on the Road to the Summit of the Future, also addressing the Space traffic Management and space governance to be hosted in Portugal 2023. Portugal continues to actively promote the preservation of a safe and secure space environment and remains strongly committed to the sales safeguard of the long term use of outer space. Thank you very much.",4
S2M626,2,6,Japan,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Japan welcomes the commitment made by other states on direct ascent, such as direct ascent and missile testing during this OWG. In light of this, allow me to cry for Japan's commitment. Japan's missile difference system is different from undisputed missile. Japanese Missile different system is a purely defensive system to defend lives and properties of Japanese seasoning. It doesn't pose any threats to other states, and Japan has repeatedly been explaining this to the International committee. Thank you.",2
S2M628,2,6,United States,"Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to provide remarks today regarding today's panel discussion on current and future space to space threats by states to space systems. For this part of the agenda we are discussing space based capabilities which may be used against other objects in orbit. As we heard from our panelists, there are a wide variety of concepts for space based capabilities, many which can be considered dual use or dual purpose. And some which include the ability to deliver a spectrum. Of reversible and non reversible effects on other satellites. These concepts span from basic projectiles to complex space systems and can include kinetic kill vehicles, radio frequency jammers, lasers, high power microwaves and robotic mechanisms. This is an important category to discuss at this open-ended working group as we think about norms of responsible behaviors and issues related to the prevention of an arms race in outer space. However, as our panelists noted, there are serious challenges to a discussion of regulating behaviors related to space to space counter space capabilities which can be broadly broken down into three categories, technical challenges, definitional challenges and verification challenges. With regard to technical challenges, as Assistant Secretary Stewart discussed yesterday, the United States believes that the most pressing anti satellite threat arises from ground to space weapons, as demonstrated by a number of destructive direct descent anti satellite missile tests. Instead of building a fragile and expensive satellite, many of these ground based systems are generally easier to develop, test and maintain and thus can be significantly cheaper to acquire. To date, four countries have undertaken the deliberate behavior of conducting destructive direct descent anti satellite missile tests. Some of these tests created thousands of pieces of debris that threaten all countries satellites and increase the potential for misunderstanding and mistrust. As Miss Victoria Sampson of the Secure World Foundation noted yesterday, as these tests continue, states may begin to normalize the destructive testing of direct ascent anti satellite missiles. This normalization would be concerning and inconsistent with the long term sustainability of outer space. Unlike ground based systems, space to space technologies have a number of significant technical challenges. The operational space environment itself is highly hazardous, bombarding spacecraft with invisible radiation, requiring spacecraft to avoid dangerous and sometimes untracked debris in each orbit, and necessitating operators to maintain a delicate balance between the wide spectrum of temperatures created from being directly heated by the Sun. Versus freezing in the coldness of space. Size, cost and weight are factors that must be taken into account in order to launch a satellite into orbit. Once launched, there is no easy access to a space based capability, whether to access its functioning, fix any issues that occur after launch, or physically review its capabilities. Moreover, most space based capabilities must be able to maneuver relatively close to their target to conduct their mission, whether that would be on orbit servicing or potential weapons deployment. Maintaining tracking consistent control and operating with precision is delicate and difficult, compounded by a finite amount of fuel and operating lifetime while in orbit. Secondly, as we have discussed extensively here, there is the need to be careful in our deliberations not to develop definitions of space based weapons that could constrain new novel or valuable capabilities merely because these capabilities have an inherent ability to be misused because of their dual purpose nature. As we heard this morning, novel capabilities have the potential to provide and enable space based services such as. Communications for underserved communities. The presentation by Miss Iowa Imato is an excellent example of the challenges we face with those dual purpose systems on orbit. Servicing satellites will allow for the extension of life of satellites and in the future may be able to repair and build satellites in orbit. Active debris removal systems will have the ability to maneuver or deorbit non operational satellites, rocket bodies and other debris. Thereby helping preserve the long term sustainability of the outer space environment. Some on orbit demonstrations have included the use of a net, a harpoon or magnet to accomplish this task. Just as we talked about the robotic arms as a possible counter space weapons, robotic arms could also be used for this type of on orbit surfacing capability, the capability to excuse me. We have lost, we've lost a bit here. The capability to grapple another satellite is inherently dual use. Such a capability could be used to repair, service, or dispose of a satellite, or alternatively, to degrade or destroy another satellite. If we create broad definitions of weapons that include the ability to, say, quote, destroy, damage, or disrupt the normal functioning End Quote of a satellite, we may end up constraining the development of these promising systems. Alternately, we could be creating a situation where misunderstandings or misrepresentations about these systems. Could lead to miscalculations or an increase in tensions. Finally, beyond definitions, there are still questions about how you would verify that a system was a weapon, partially because of the definitional questions and the dual purpose nature of such systems. Even where we to be able to craft effective definitions, there are no proposals for how to do verifications of weapons in outer space. Verification, as we all know, is a painstaking, resource intensive, difficult and essential part of arms control agreements. But how can we verify whether a satellite in orbit has, for example, a missile on it? How do we understand the intent of a country with regards to its on orbit servicing capability? Let's discuss another example. NASA has been working for over a decade on planetary defense, that is, how to save the Earth from asteroid impacts. So later this month, NASA will smash their quote double asteroid Redirection test. Satellite also called dart into the Didymus moonlight in order to deflect it. In essence, this will be a satellite initiating an autonomous collision with a space object. But the behavior is benign and beneficial. So how do we avoid hindering its peaceful use? And while we continue to address Earth to Space Anti System satellites as a priority, it is right for us to consider how to identify and develop norms about how the satellites operate in space. Yes, their behavior. We will reserve our ideas for specific norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior until the next scheduled session of the OEWG, but in the interim, we urge states to carefully consider how to articulate. The specific threats and the potential harms arising from space to space behaviors. Then we should determine which behaviors could reduce misunderstanding, misinterpretation, or miscalculation, while also acknowledging and taking into account the associated technical, definitional, and verification challenges. Thank you.",0
S2M630,2,6,France,"Thank you very much, Chair. The very first thing I'd like to do is thank the Russian Federation for those slides. They summarize things much better than most of us tend to do. Leading on from the issues that we dealt yesterday and looking at today's issues is that space space threats really do throw highlights. The question of dual use and dual purpose in space. And this is an important distinction that it's important to draw. And we really thank the speaker this morning for the very clear presentation that we received on this issue. Then the attribution and verification are additional challenges even for the most well established space powers that really have to get to grips with this. Space to space. Just like Earth to space, we can establish a sort of classification or graduation of threat and irresponsible behavior. But a proximity operation does not entail the same risk of miscalculation and misperception or collision or unmanaged escalation. Then a rendezvous operation. No pure and simple destruction or neutralization of. A space object. From this mornings exchanges we also note that there are different points of view as to what proximity operations mean as well as. Rendezvous operations. For these we use the RPO acronym in English. These distinctions and the consequences that they entail, or a better understanding of this is an easy. Achievement for this group and those that will come afterwards. For example, we can look at the Lexicon of space terms which has been announced by others including Unidire and France will be very happy to contribute to this in Frances view, these two types of activities, so Rante view and proximity operations. Have different consequences and there are different things at stake and they can be understood as irresponsible or responsible. And both of these cases must be defined and that's why the norms must be differentiated when they come into play. And I insist on this point in a bid for synthesis. It is a discussion that. Will be brought to us tomorrow as well and it is an area in which we can make a progress in the short term in our view. Thank you.",0
S2M632,2,6,Cuba,"Thank you very much, Chair, and a good afternoon to everyone. We wish to refer to the very interesting discussion that we had this morning. And we would like to try and have more of interactive discussion rather than a general statement that we made earlier where we very clearly stated Cuba's position on the various items for discussion to this group. Now following the discussion that we've had, I think a very important idea that we suggest should be born in mind, particularly if we want this group. To achieve success is that whatever analysis we conduct here must be an analysis which includes all of the elements which are connected to this issue and relevant to it. So it must be a broad ranging and comprehensive. But on top of this, it must also bear in mind the different mandates of all the different fora that deal with this issue. Sometimes we listen to statements which are very well-intentioned, but they're really fall within the scope of regulation of space. And I don't think that this is the group where we can deal with the issues. Of course it's important to understand some issues. But I don't really understand the difference that there can be between space debris, which is the results of. The launching or destruction of different. Satellites or an Earth to space launcher, which results in other thousands of debris. Perhaps it could be a different fora that deals with this question of space debris. And that's just one example. I think we have to find a balance, ensuring that our analysis is comprehensive and includes all of the issues surrounding disarmament and the use of outer space. And at the same time, we must bear in mind that there are different fora with different mandates in order to deal with the related matters. Another very important idea. And this is something which I want to firmly put before the group and that I believe that needs further work looking to the report is that it's not possible to regulate war in space, because war in space is prohibited. So normally, when an absolute prohibition exists in legal terms, it is not possible to introduce regulation for it. That is to say that raising the issue, for example, of working on issues such as possible rules for armed conflict in space. Is a little bit like establishing rules for a possible war using biological weapons. When there is a prohibited activity, then any activity collected to that violates international law and it has a whole regime of responsibilities that swings into action. I think the danger that we have here is the reinterpreting the scope of the concepts of responsibility when we. Look at outer space regimes. Well, the only example that we have, it is the only example we have in international law of absolute responsibility. That means that the launching power is responsible for any damage that occurs, whether they comply with their international obligations or not. Similarly, if we look at the 67 treaty which deals with peaceful use, I don't understand how can we reinterpret, reinterpret this principle. To ensure that placing an arm in space is part of peaceful use, perhaps our delegation experiences some limitations in our legal analysis, but we just don't understand how placing a weapon in space could be part of a peaceful use of space. A further issue, and it's the third issue that's been tackled here, is the question of dual use. Now look, I remember a wonderful mystery story where a murder occurs with a weapon that is never found. And so it seems that when there's no weapon, then no crime has been committed. And then in fact what happened is that the weapon was ice, and the ice melted, so the weapon disappears and there's no weapon proving that a crime occurred. Along the same lines, we could say that use the ice has a dual use, and we have to now regulate how we make. Ice in our homes or residences or factories, so I'm not really concerned about dual use. Because any object. Can be considered. As something which could potentially have a dual use. However, in legal terms, the crux of the matter is not the possible use of an object, but rather on the intention of this possible use violates a norm of international law. In other words, you can put a chunk of ice up in space and at some point you intend to use this for non peaceful uses against a space object, then could be that would be a violation of international law, even though you're talking about an object that is made of ice. Now whenever we talk about dual use, there's a veil that falls over the discussions and everything is a matter of concern. But I believe that any use that is in any object that is intended for a non peaceful use then we can consider to this to be potentially a dual purpose a manufacturer can have constructed or manufactured this object for. Something that can have another use then, even if that wasn't the intention at the beginning, it can be considered potentially hazardous. I believe that when we deal with issues such as this one, we must comprehensively envisage all of activities which could fall into this possible Gray area and we must regulate them. And here our delegation differs from others because we believe that this regulation, potential regulation, should be legally binding. It is regrettable that today there are legally binding norms that are not actually being complied with today. And So what can we hope from future norms that are not legally binding? I think that we have to meet our concerns, which are very valid, and we have to do this by regulating. And the 4th idea that my delegation wishes to put to this meeting so that we can perhaps work on it, is that any responsible behaviour? Has to be strict compliance with existing legal frameworks, and this states unambiguously that space is for peaceful use only. So any use of space that is not for people uses is automatically a violation of international law or or is a violation of principles that are in a primary norm of international law. And here I move on to 1/6 point, although I'm not sure I've counted properly. In any case, we have to think about the possible outcome of this group. We shouldn't just end up with a legally binding instrument to regulate their behaviors that we believe are or could at some point be a violation of international law. But we also have to strengthen the enforcing mechanisms for the existing regimes. If we think about the law of the sea, well they're a court or tribunal was set up and there to some extent a number of concerns can be allayed and examined. Sometimes I hear the voicing of concerns such as how are we going to be able to verify well, quite simple if you have an impartial independent mechanism in place and you have a doubt or concern that some state is making a non peaceful use of space. Then you can go to that impartial independent body. You can lodge a complaint or a question to solve that concern. That would be very straightforward. Everything else could just be political language that somebody is 1 state is considers themselves threatened by another state and vice versa. So I believe that here we shouldn't just restate that any irresponsible behaviour. Is a non compliance with existing law. There's also the question of regulating conduct that falls into a grey area and on top of this we should strengthen mechanisms that exist already in this area and to go back to the question that Cuba asked this morning. On the question. Of possible use against a space object. Use of force, that is. Well, I agree with what one of the panelists said that Article 51 of the UN Charter is not a justification to place weapons in space. I'm 100% in agreement with that statement. I also. Believe that, including in the example that Cuba raised, that a state uses a space object. To cause or intervene in an armed conflict on earth? Well, here the question is not how to apply international humanitarian law, and we could have a whole series of comments about that. I think the question that needs to be asked is automatically when a country. Or a corporation. Decides. To use a space object militarily, then they automatically. Are in a situation where they are violating international law, and I say this because Cuba is concerned at some recent statements made by corporations that. Talk about how they use their space resources for war and in our view this is an open declaration of a violation of international law because whether it has a dual use or not. A space object may or may not have been conceived for that purpose. But at that moment when any state themselves. Either themselves or allows a corporation to use a space object for a non peaceful use, that is to participate in an armed conflict on earth, Then we are falling fair and square in an area of violation of international law. So this is not just about Article 51 of the the charter, but it also implies a violation of customary laws. There are existing customary laws that are relevant here. There is the right of states to respond with countermeasures to the actions of other states violating norms of international law. So, Chair, I believe that all of these host of elements, which I've mentioned, would help shed light on the debate. So to conclude, I summarize that responsible behavior. In essence, is compliance with established international norms to attempt to regulate such behavior. Kurds. Be a claim to regulate a possible use of something which is absolutely prohibited and that is something my delegation could not go along with. So Chair, thank you very much. I apologize for speaking at some length, but I do believe my comments could assist with the in an interactive debate in this area.",4
S2M634,2,6,Japan,"I'd like to share Japan's beer on the Rendezvous and proximity operations, or RPO's. The category of our peers is 1 to make substantive progress on while security concerns about potential use of our bills for marine control space purpose arising. When we orbit, services such as the life extension and referring of satellites can be beneficial to space actors by contributing to space sustainability. The same techn. However, can also be used to capture or disrupt satellites in a hostile manner. Japan believes that it is necessary to distinguish between such activities. What we should focus on when considering threats is types of our peers that might result in collision without any notification or consent. Enhancing transparency regarding these activities will contribute to transparency and confidence breaking measures. Japan would also like to share its view on interference to space assets by marine cyberattacks. If states conduct cyber attacks against other countries space assets and take control of those assets to maneuver them to collide with other space objects. Or make them enter the atmosphere forcibly, it would result the creation of more debris. Thus denying other states peaceful use of outdoor space. Therefore, this kind of attack should be regarded as a threat. In addition, interference of other countries already warning systems or nuclear command, control and communication systems may cause misunderstanding, miscalculation, and contingent situations between nations. Such activities should also be regarded as threats. Thank you.",0
S2M636,2,6,Switzerland,"Musila. President, President, thank you for giving me the floor. We would like to thank the panelists who enlightened us this morning on topic #3 on the agenda of our meeting, namely Space to Space Threads. By states to space systems. The impact of these threats is not fundamentally different from that coming from Earth systems. As we highlighted during the exchanges on topic #2, these weapons can potentially undermine access to essential services provided by space systems. They may also. Undermine the long term sustainability of space, in particular by creating debris. They may also pose a threat to global security or stability if attacks are made against military satellites, in particular early warning missile satellites. In this context, I wish to make the three following points. The possible use of coable tool. Permanentic satellites is also. As disturbing as the use of direct descent assets, they also create much debris. When we spoke about direct ascent assets. We stated that we should prohibit or ban their use. And this also applies to Co orbital anti satellite missiles. Secondly. Rendezvous and proximity. Operations, whether they are hostile or uncoordinated, are a threat to the safety and security of space systems. The deliberate approach of the states of satellites of one state without their initial knowledge or without consent by another state, might be interpreted as a hostile act. Such rendezvous and proximity operations can be used to observe. Deactivate or threaten satellites of our country. And the threat of such operations? Can lead certain countries. To place defensive capabilities on their satellites. This would only contribute to a deterioration of the security situation in space, as with other weapons, clearly. Rules for responsible behaviour are necessary with regard to Rpos. And we would like, in this regard, to highlight the proposals in the document submitted by Germany and the Philippines under which the three following activities would be considered as irresponsible, namely. Approaching. And or shadow an active satellite without. Anticipatory coordination. Or using a COBRA tool? Or do you use system which could damage a targeted satellite? Conducting rendezvous operations with active satellites of another state without initial consent or notification, carrying out proximity operations which disrupt the functioning of another space system during an orbital maneuver or a targeted satellite without prior consent or without the concern state. Having been asked to discuss the situation. In this regard, Switzerland believes that it is important to bolster the application of transparency building measures and to develop notification mechanisms improving. Space situational awareness as well. It seems to be crucial, crucial that we heighten international cooperation in this area. The third and last point which I would like to raise is about the potential placement of certain weapon systems in space such a development. Whether it be the pricing in space of interceptors? As part of an anti missile defense system or equipping satellites. In order to be able to defend them against attack. Will have deleterious effects they would contribute not just to. Increasing distrust. But they would also. Be particular targets which would be attractive and they might increase the possibility of an armed conflict in space. Prohibiting weapons being placed in space is an essential element. Even if it's not a sufficient response to many challenges, in particularly with regard to the dual nature of space systems. Thank you very much, Chair.",0
S2M638,2,6,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. My delegation wishes to again thank the panelists that provided their expertise on this topic during the informal segment of our meeting this morning. In our earlier intervention, we stressed that the threat perceptions vary depending on state's degree of dependence on their space based assets and how crucial they are in their national security. It is therefore important to discuss these perceptions while Nissan spacefaring states like the Philippines. Have relatively limited space assets. They place a higher degree of importance on those modest assets compared to those with more established space programs. In relative terms, nascent spacefaring states allocate a more significant portion of their national resources, including financial, human resources and political capital, to develop space programs, which are essential to achieving their Sustainable Development Goals. For the Philippines, therefore, the security of our space assets is a crucial concern that has implications on our national security. It is possible that, of all the dimensions of security threats that are on our agenda today, nascent spacefaring nations may be most vulnerable in the context of space to space threats for the following reasons. First, our space situational awareness capabilities remain modest and our ability to monitor our space based assets and the immediate environment around them is limited. Second, our current space based assets have no propulsion systems and therefore lack the maneuverability to evade physical threats such as space debris or other satellites. It is in this context that the Philippines echoes Asian Skull for continued action to mitigate the effects of space debris which remain A relevant current space to space threat. The Philippines also reiterates that any deliberate action that creates debris is irresponsible and in sound circumstances. Even threatening. In our working Paper #17 with Germany, we stressed that the lack of first channels of communications and 2nd clear and internationally understood standards and norms of behavior constitute security risks which could pose a challenge to security and stability in the space domain and could lead to inadvertent actions and escalations. This analysis is informed by our own national experience, potential collision between our satellites and foreign satellites. That have propulsion systems and therefore maneuverability is a recurring concern. Such collisions would have severe impact on critical services, including the context of humanitarian action and disaster response. In instances where the likelihood of such potential collision reaches a critical threshold, immediate communication with the concerned state is an urgent exigency. Such communication could include clarification whether the proconsimity arises from a deliberate operation, and if so. What is the rationale for such operation? Yet it is unclear to us how such communication could be actualized. This proves to us that work must be done to develop such channels, possibly through the identification of national points of contact and the development of mechanisms for consultations. It is also clear to us that the threshold for activating the optional tool of consultations under Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty must be kept to a minimum. Mr. Chair, consistent with the position of ASEAN, we reaffirm the vital importance of preventing an arms race in outer space and its weaponization. We aspire for a legally binding and multilaterally verifiable instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, including the prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space and the prohibition of the threat or use of force against outer space objects. Asian States initiative on this subject, however, should take into account the inherent right to peaceful uses of space technologies. They should therefore not hamper innovation. As my delegation stressed in our earlier interventions, threats do not necessarily arise from capabilities which are in themselves value neutral. The most important factor is behavior. In this regard, it is of practical importance for the OEWG to commence a conversation with a view to addressing a wide range of potential, current and future. Space to space sets. That could arise from certain irresponsible behaviors including the conduct of proximity operations that impair the safe operation of another space asset, rendezvous operations on active satellites by foreign states without prior consultations and consent, and releasing of objects such as sub satellites or ejecting projectile like fragments in the immediate vicinity of other satellites. The Philippine soaps that OEWG can facilitate such conversations with a view to developing common understandings. That would inform our work to develop norms that support and. A predictable and rules based governance regime covering outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M640,2,6,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for organising another round of interesting and valuable presentations this morning on space to space threats to space systems. Let me firstly make a few points related to proximity operations. Proximity operations may involve stationing 1 satellite close to another for a period of time, or conducting a flyby in close proximity, perhaps to inspect that satellite and understand its purpose. However, if a proximity operation does not follow a predictable pattern, or the capabilities aboard the newly stationed satellite are unknown, the affected state may worry that it is not peaceful in nature and perceive a threat, increasing the chances of misunderstanding and miscalculation. Turning to rendezvous operations, these are integral to active debris removal and inorbit servicing. Such activities offer significant opportunities to improve the space environment and develop new industries. However, as we heard this morning, these capabilities could also be repurposed to attack a satellite. It is therefore important for building trust that the development and testing of such technologies is done as transparently as possible and that there are clear and agreed procedures for the conduct of such activity. There is a particular responsibility on those nations with advanced capabilities to cooperate and lead the way in the development of such procedures. The UK LED Removed Debris Satellite has proven harpooning capabilities for removing space debris. This kind of capability could lead to concern or misunderstanding if we had not been open or transparent on our intentions. It was interesting to hear this morning about the work being done by industry to develop clear standards and procedures for the conduct of rendezvous and proximity operations for commercial operators. The UK considers that more work is needed on the potential applicability of the solutions being developed in the commercial sector to our discussions on space security. Mr. Chair, notwithstanding the dual use or dual purpose nature of most space systems, we have heard that some states are developing and deploying on orbit counter space capabilities. These could in theory encompass a range of destructive and non destructive capabilities. Such as jamming, the use of directed energy, or the use of projectiles or missiles. It would be standard practice for states to test those systems. But how is a state to determine whether the deployment of an on orbit capability is a test or a preparation for an attack? What if such testing is conducted near another state satellite or affects the functioning of that satellite? As we noted yesterday, the risks of misunderstanding, miscalculation and unintended escalation increased further if the behaviour of one state in space threatens or creates the perception of a threat to a strategically important system, such as a satellite that is involved in ballistic missile early warning and nuclear command and control. In conclusion, Mr. Chair, we heard this morning that it is uniquely difficult to determine the true nature of space space capabilities. To understand the intent of space based activities and to predict the impact of using counter space capabilities. We heard that military capabilities can be used for civilian activities. And that civilian capabilities can be used for hostile purposes. And we heard that military activities in space may not be easily distinguishable from civilian activities. As we argued in our opening statement and underlined yesterday, these observations under score why it is not enough to focus on capability and technology alone. And why measures limited to preventing the placement of weapons in space failed to address threats, To address threats to space systems in a holistic and effective way. The issues around Rpos and dual purpose systems illustrate this vividly. We need to start by focusing on the ways states behave when they develop, test and use such capabilities. Behaviours, unlike many characteristics of counter space technologies and capabilities, can be observed, verified and more readily regulated, and could ultimately be enshrined in legally binding instruments. Responsible behaviors is not an alternative to, but a first step towards legally binding instruments. But we need to take a holistic, inclusive and iterative approach, beginning with dialogue and promoting common understanding and exploring, exploring the role of voluntary norms as a first step. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M642,2,6,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to take up the suggestion or initiative of the distinguished representative of Cuba to turn this into a more interactive dialogue. So I would like to respond, if I may, to his murder mystery example using the deadly icicle. So first the lawyer in me has to to say that the absence of the ability to locate a murder weapon or any weapon used for crime, does not mean no crime has been committed. It simply means that. Identification of the perpetrator is more difficult, but a crime has been committed. The more relevant aspect though to our work here is the fact that you could use an icicle to commit a crime. You could use a pen to commit a crime. Could use my colleagues impressive shoe to commit a crime. So there's so many things, so many physical objects that can be used to commit a crime or to commit an act that would be not conducive to the security of space, that it would be extremely difficult to define all the things that would be prohibited. Either your definition would have to be so broad as to be useless, or so specific that you would miss certain items. And so in the murder mystery example, of course we don't necessarily prohibit the use of any particular item in any particular location. We prohibit the behavior itself. And that's sort of the general idea here behind responsible behaviors is that you go towards the behavior that you're trying to avoid or eliminate or reduce in order to improve space security for everyone and reduce threats. That's the general idea here and I think this is this. The deadly icicle analogy works in this context because we heard so many of our presenters today talk about how these technologies can be used in multiple, multiple ways, very beneficial ways, the use of lasers for laser ranging. And of course we use radio frequencies to communicate with our satellites. So we wouldn't want to ban these technologies or or robotic manipulators as we've used before the the Canada arm example. These things are useful. So we don't want to ban these things. We don't want these things to be caught by a definition of weapon. What we want to do is try to regulate the behavior, govern the behavior, encourage states to behave when they're using these technologies in a way that is conducive to reducing threats and improving space security. The other brief point I wanted to to address was the idea that, well, because war is prohibited, that's it. We can't regulate anything to do with war and we don't need to. If that were so, that would be fantastic, but. The United Nations Charter has for many, many decades prohibited the threat or use of force in international relations. And yet, unfortunately, it still happens. And the United Nations Charter itself does have some form of regulation in that you have Article 51 on self-defense. So notwithstanding the fact that you have a absolute prohibition on the threat or use of force, you still have a provision that contemplates the use of force in response to self-defense. And then you of course have an entire body of international law, international humanitarian law, which governs the use of force when you're in the context of an armed conflict. And to simply bring this point home a little bit more pointedly, there is an article, Article 89 in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that that also says that. The high C should only be used for peaceful purposes and yet we know that there are non peaceful and military uses of the Seas. So you can't just end the analysis at Article 24 and say that's it, we don't need to deal with it anymore there. There is law that governs the use of force when it occurs. It applies on Earth. International humanitarian law applies on Earth. It applies in space. It applies in any domain where an armed conflict is ongoing. Thank you.",2
S2M644,2,6,Germany,"And thank you for your proposal to proceed in a more interactive manner. We highly appreciate this and we'll try to contribute to this approach. We would like to make four, four points at this point in time. First, we'd like to talk about dual use and your purpose, because we believe this has been a very interesting aspect of this morning's presentation. We particularly see that on on the the activities on orbit that have been in the focus of today's discussion. Offer ample, ample examples. Of systems that have a dual use capability or in the language of tomorrow. Today's presented your purpose. A possibility for dual purpose use. So when you take for instance renew and proximity operations. The intention to develop them is in many cases the fact that you want to be able to maintenance or repair. Spacecraft. And thus they are in a way, a precondition for sustainable use of the space environment and the technology that is very promising and that that we should explore as an international community because it will help us to make better use of outer space for all of us, but at the same time. These are these are activities that can be can be used in a nefarious way And what what I believe is important or we believe is Germany is important is something that was mentioned by the colleagues from the Philippines in their intervention that. There's an openness to to regulate, but this kind of regulation should should not go so far as to to restrict the development of of promising technologies, and that is why we believe it's necessary to to further explore what what kind of concepts are useful. To, to, to, to base regulation on and we believe that the concept of a space weapon. Has has severe difficulties. We understand that at first glance you might say that it's a logical continuation of the argument of Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty that you say we have a provision on the no placement of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction and why should not we move on to to? Ban the placement of other weapons because we believe in these examples of rendezvous and proximity operations and in particular, active debris removal. Show that the notion of a weapon is ill defined in space and does not offer offer. A good start for either kind of regulation, either in forms of principles of responsible behavior or possibly. In the form of a legally binding instrument. Rather, we see that these are examples where, as a first step, transparency and confidence building measures are helpful. And I think this is something that that concerns us all. I've been looking over the course of today, for instance at the at the website of our national space agency. To find out what they are doing on active debris removal and and for instance the device called the space hand and you will find a certain amount of information there. I don't know whether it's all the information you need to assess whether this is solely for for peaceful purposes as it certainly is. But nevertheless we believe transparency and openness about these activities is a is a good start and a real dialogue on what kind of information is necessary to to to assess and and in a way. Assessed credibility of of of the peaceful nature of the activity is something that's important and and we hope we can have a discussion on this. The second subject I would like to talk about is the question of the OR the notion of the of the peaceful use. And in the question what what what we need to consider here in order not to limit our discussion. There there is the argument made by 1 delegation that when you talk about responsible behaviour and in a way accept the notion that that there's a potential for conflict. That you pave the way for for weaponization of space. We do not see that logic. We believe that there there is. There is conflict, which is when international humanitarian law applies and which is a situation which we want to avoid that it happens in outer space, but below the threshold of conflict there's risky behaviour and we believe our job here is really to analyse what kind of risky behavior exists in space. And what can we do to make sure it's less risky? And to analyze this, we believe it's necessary to accept that the peaceful use of outer space. Is is in a way a non aggressive use of outer space? We believe from the side of the German delegation that there are military activities in outer space which which are reconcilable with the notion of the peaceful use of outer space, for instance the use of satellites for military communication. We believe this is a non escalator behavior. It's one that most militaries do and it is nothing that in a way leads to to escalation and conflict in space, whereas other behaviors for instance. Rendezvous and proximity operations that are conducted in a way that another state feels a threat. Perception. These might maybe maybe behaviours that that fall under the category of risk risky behaviors and these are the ones we need to look at And here we really need to to to dig into the details and see what what exactly is it that makes other states concerned. The third question I'd like to to talk about is, is these dichotomy of behaviors and capabilities. And we have had two days of presentation and what what I take from these two days of presentation is that on both days we had rather long list of capabilities that can be used to to to conduct behavior which which is problematic and which we are discussing all the time. On both days we we talked about kinetic threats. The anti kinetic threats from earth to space, the directors and missiles and there are these space to space kinetic threats for instance satellites getting too close to other satellites and damaging them or harming them in some other way. So we believe that and the same is true for instance for electromagnetic interference that you have ground based sat com jammers but you can also do that. From one satellite to another. So we believe there's limited value. Exploring just the capabilities because it really depends how they are used. In particular, if you take into account that you'll use nature, that on orbit these kinetic effects are or can be can be achieved by a system that looks not very suspicious, just the satellite which which is maneuverable. So this leads me to my last point, the question of responsible behaviors and and and and what we believe we should look at. Here we took note of the of the. Of the remark made by by our Swiss colleague that not not only ground based ante satellite capabilities but also Co orbital anti satellite capabilities are very problematic and that that we should should seek to regulate them in in one way. We believe this is this is a question where we need to take into account different aspects. These Co orbital anti satellite capabilities. Just maneuverable satellites and therefore it's necessary to to analyze what what are the behaviors that that lead to a threat perception and and one behavior which we believe can be very problematic is a situation where you approach and follow another satellite and hold hold the satellite at risk by a highly manoeuvrable satellite that could either. Just impact kinetically on the satellite or has a device for manipulating that satellite, for instance robotic arm or something like that. And but, but we still need to further explore this and and move into the field of the rendezvous operations. And here what we took from the presentation this morning by Miss Aya Ivamoto was that in industry there's a clear notion that. It's beneficial to avoid contact with another spacecraft and this really fits with what we suggest and what is in the working paper which we introduced together with the Philippines. That, in a way, conducting A rendezvous operation that is touching another spacecraft without consultation on consensus is irresponsible. And then we'd like to move on to the question of proximity operations. And here this morning we heard that an industry standard is to say we want to minimize contact. And again here we believe, yes, we need to minimize contact and somehow we need to balance this with the freedom of manoeuvre. And probably here things are not as clear cut as on in the case of rendezvous operations. But still there's a possibility to flesh out what actually is respect for other states interest when it comes to manoeuvre. And this is a question which we believe is not disconnected from existing international law. We already have the concept of you regarding the Outer Space Treaty. And and we we firmly believe in upholding that concept but what we believe is that in order for this concept to be really effective we need to develop state practice that actually operationalizes this concept and and we believe that a discussion on responsible behaviors can really help us to inform the development of of state practice for due regard and so we we really see that I'm responsible behaviours. Has an advantage in strengthening existing international law. But of course, and this is a notion that was brought up by our British colleague, which we fully support, that eventually an identification of responsible behaviors may also lead up to new international law and illegally binding instrument. But what we believe is that we need to go through this process of analysing really the behaviors that that are problematic and and based on that analysis take forward a discussion which may eventually lead to illegally banning instrument. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S2M646,2,6,Egypt,"Thank you Mr. Chair for giving me the floor and for inviting us to engage in the discussion in a little bit more informal way so we can share our thoughts away from the pre manufactured statements, let's call it that way. I would be very brief. I will just touch on a few ideas that I will would love to get back to them later on this week. But they are all on the conclusion that I had from our three days of work and through reflecting on the exercise as a whole. Because sometimes when we go too much in detail, we lose sight about where we would like to go. And this is the challenge I have seen. We have been through a plethora of challenges that deals with the security of and the threats of of space, let's put it that way. But the the increasing challenge that I have seen growing with the time as we proceed in our work is. The lack of definition. And we tend to deal with the whole exercise in a little bit emotional manner. And part of this is attributed to dealing with issues that lacks common understanding and common definition and common ground that's at first place. Perhaps we also we there are lack of agreement on the views on the best way forward. Very frankly and very straightforward. The challenge that we're dealing with signaling one big message. There is a gap in the legal regime that deals with the issue, and this gap cannot be dealt with the sense on the basis of expressions that lacks very concrete, clear, crisp definition. Responsible, sensitive, or kind of words? That their definition is left for those who is saying them, those who is making the case. But what may be responsible to some may not be responsible. What could be responsible at this particular? Time of humanity where technology is hindered by certain limitation may not be the same case in in few years when the science advances and we acquire new capabilities. Having said that, Mr. Chair, I think. We need to dwell on the body of literature and of laws that we already have, because many of the notions that were raised today already exists in other legal. Treaties and other legal instruments that have been existing since 1967, for example. This gap could be, in the view of my delegation bridged. If we worked on good faith. Trying to answer the very initial question that has been lying existing on the agenda of the CDE for almost four or five decades, which is how to prevent an arms race in the outer space. This has been the very initial serious challenge. This has been the issues that we're trying to deal with. All what we're doing now is we're trying to take a small little part of the initial challenge and to deal with it. But at the end of the day, we'll definitely has to answer that question. The overarching framework that encompasses most of our concerns is how to prevent an arms race in outer space. The problem that we're dealing with is one side of the coin, it could be a legitimate use, the other it could be non legitimate use, it could be kind of threat. And this is not for the very first time in in the scientific domain we are challenged by this dimension. If we can take step back a little bit and we reflect on other scientific domains like nuclear technology for example, this has been the very similar case, I mean. You can have a peaceful approach towards the technology or a non peaceful approach. I don't want to import the discussions from the nuclear dimension to space because I think here we are in a better position to reach more agreeable and common understanding and we respect the positions of of the different states with that regard. However, it is very important while we are laying the ground for our work, even when we are trying to work within our mandate as it stated in the General Assembly resolution, try to identify our destination. Where are we going to with this work if we identify this responsible behavior are we going to leave it in vacuum or this could be a milestone to bridge illegal gap, illegal vacuum that we're trying to to to to overcome. And having said that, I think we should reconsider the available literature part of which is the draft treaty by China and and the Russian Federation presented in that regard. I mean why don't we discuss what is in there? And see how we can take advantage of this. It is, it's on the table. We're not asking to embrace it, we're not asking to promote for it, but we believe that it's very commendable. Work by this open-ended working group try to identify irresponsible behaviour. But this is not a goal at itself, it's an enabler. And this is how Egypt sees out this exercise, This exercise should have our work enabled, leading to a further advanced step that has been on the disarmament, disarmament agenda. Since 4:00 decades or more, which? How to prevent an arms race in outer space? And in that basis we are really willing to engage in good faith in that exercise, but not to consider the exercise as a final step or a final destination on its own. And I will be frank, we had a group of governmental experts tried to reach sort of identification on similar elements for prevention of arms race and outer space, and it failed to conclude the report on that regard. So I would invite our discussion to consider how we put our discussion within the larger context. We are not operating in vacuum. This is not something that came out of the blue. This is something has been on the agenda of this argument for many, many years. The question I failed to identify that I would be very much interested to learn from you and from the distinguished panelists and from the room as a whole, how we can use this exercise to bridge the gap that has already existed, trying to address the issue of prevention of arms race in outer space. I feel very frankly that we are trying to avoid. Coming to this term and this is something that I cannot understand. I mean, this is something that has been in the one document for many, many years. We should not be ashamed to consider to see if where is the linkage between our exercise and that ultimate goal, as we, we call it, returning to to to my discussion, in order not to defeat Mr. Chair. There is a legal vacuum. There is deficiency when the regime dealing with these kind of challenges in order to have a transparent. Efficient, verifiable approach towards dealing with this kind of threat. It is unavoidable to deal with it from a legal perspective. We cannot leave challenges up to the definition for like minded approach. This changes, technology changes, policy changes, politics changes. It's not there but at least the minimum common denominator that ensures minimum fairness for everyone and for every party. And is the legal approach the like a nuclear dimension? Again, I am sorry to refer to refer to that but we have the right of peaceful users to nuclear energy. There should be. It's very clear that there is a right of peaceful use of outer space. Yes, we agree on it as as a goal, but how to put this into action? How to protect the right of developing or the newcomers to the space field into access and this technology? How? How to avoid using this kind of notion to prefer to to prohibit or prevent the newcomers to reach the same level. This is something that we need to address very frankly. If we could have this approach and discussion on dual use, dual use in general, it triggers the discussion of export control regimes, for example in other domains. So we need to have checks and balances within our discussion that ensures fairness and satisfaction for all those who are engaging with that exercise. There is a major challenge, which is the discrepancy between the level of technology and the level of advancement and the level of scientific. A capability between those who are engaging in this exercise, some already achieved, some are still aspiring to achieve and some still on the very very beginning. For example, Egypt has established a space agency with a very ambitious view towards space exploration and how to peacefully utilize space for its development needs and all the developing countries needs. This is something we need to take into consideration. And I believe without having a minimum common denominator through a structured approach that try to put common definition at least and the common ground for understanding, it will be very challenging to proceed. This open-ended working group could play a very useful role in identifying this communalities and and and widen the conversions and the common view towards how to proceed forward, but it is not a destination in itself. There is an ultimate goal that we need to get to, which is to avoid. The unsuccessful experiences on the Mother Earth, to be repeated again on space, would love to keep the space free from military and arms races. It should. We hope that it will remain as a common resource for the for the mankind and for humanity. And in in order to do the best to achieve this goal, it's unavoidable to address the main question, how to avoid the arms race and outer space. Anti satellite missiles or technology or any kind of hostile technology could be addressed under this domain. There is nothing could hinder or have us prohibited from discussing this but under the framework of how to prevent an arms race in outer space. But selecting a certain technology and leaving the ultimate question or how to keep the space peaceful, I don't think this is the best approach and I'll stop here. Thank you Mr. Chair.",4
S2M648,2,6,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Many things were said today about the United States. Our positions are well known and long standing, so I will not prolong the day of my distinguished colleagues by reiterating those points. However, I do need to call it to the attention of my Russian colleagues that the United States draft resolution was distributed to all delegations electronically by UNOTA Geneva earlier today. In this message it invites all Member States to informal. Consultations on our draft resolution on Wednesday, September 21st at 11:00 AM in this very room. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S2M72,2,7,The Russian Academy of Sciences,"Thank you and it is an honor to be here. I hope my contribution to our discussions will be useful and without further introductions. Let me try to say a few words about the strategic integration concerns relating to the prospective deployment of space based weapons designed to attack terrestrial targets and what specific capabilities for concepts do this entail. I would also try to address the issues of space space based systems. That will not weapons, but they enable terrestrial abilities. Well, space to Earth threats are an extremely important topic, and to some extent it is even more crucial than Earth to space or space to space for one single reason. This is basically the foundation for the so-called concept of the ultimate high ground. This concept itself is really questionable, but the idea that one can deploy something that there's orbit or even beyond and be capable of striking any target on Earth's surface is perceived as both very desirable and extremely threatening. This whole narrative can be separated into several buckets. On the most strategic level, we have the idea that nuclear weapons can be deployed into space and thus increase once nuclear strike capability. Luckily, at the moment this is the only type of space weaponization that is, well, explicitly prohibited. But from time to time it reappears in discussions, either as a threat that might evolve from deployment of conventional spec systems at lowest orbit, or as yet another tool for survival, second strike capabilities from higher bids with those can hardly be reached.The second bucket deals with the. Nuclear deterrence and strategic stability, which is currently based on a short second strike capability. Here we have well, 2 1/2 parts of the problem. First, space to Earth. Weapons can be used in disarming strikes against launchers. Second, those weapons can disrupt We've been destroying nuclear command control communications for NC 3, including the decapitating mission of the country's leadership. So those who won't be able to actually pursue or engage in nuclear retaliation. Also, and now let's talk about the small health, The whole idea of space based strike assets as a part of overall missile defense architecture can be considered space to earth at least important to some extent. Because if this space based strike assets being a part of missile defense, if they can take out the missiles at boost phase, well it is almost terrestrial. 3rd bucket if the space based strike assets for conventional conflicts. Here one can imagine the capability to destroy any target anywhere at any time, depending on the number of those track platforms and their orders, of course. For such strikes, sorry, one can think about counter proliferation missions or support for all eyes in conflicts with third powers or punitive actions, and also while decapitating strikes that I've mentioned with relation to nuclear deterrence. Hopefully we're still somewhat away from all of those buckets, but the ideas are there and what is the ideas are there and we have growing capabilities. Many countries invest in country measures just in case. So we see a driver for the arms race in outer space, which hopefully will be able to prevent. However, what we see right now, and it already has become one of the most remarkable qualities of the Modern Warfare. Is the space layer is crucial for supporting terrestrial warfighting? Spaces provide intelligence for violence, reconnaissance or ISR, and they were targeting as well as communications, both on tactical, operational or strategic levels. These capabilities are ever growing and well, the most important part of this issue is that there is always some level of deniability, in case, for example, sharing of the ISR or even targeting data with allies engaged in war fighting. Moreover, we see a growing number of commercial actors in this. All these leads to possible spillover, all this of that conflict, because sometimes even commercial actors can provide the data that is crucial for mutual operations, and then the country that perceives itself as a target of these operations might. Engage in fighting these third parties. At the same time, we also see efforts to develop countermeasures against all sorts of the space terrorist capabilities. And these counter measures in the roughly separated also into several groups, although those groups are extremely interconnected. First, we can speak about so-called soft measures which include concealment, dispersal and shifts and operational concepts for terrestrial warfighting. Second, those can be enhanced by technological measures which include hardening of these targets, decoys and electronic morphic capabilities. 3rd we can speak about hard active countermeasures aimed at disrupting adversary space related networks through cyber or electronic warfare as well as kinetic needs in order to degrade and or even destroy those operational capabilities. And this is again the problem where the support of this for that country engage in were fighting by sharing space and capabilities can lead to a speed over the war fighting to 3rd powers. Again, those kind of measures have mentioned they have limits to the effectiveness. And can be employed as a combination to overcome these limits. If in case the party that is engaged in developing is going to measure, wants to achieve any level of success. My final point would be about the role of international community and especially this open and working group. I have another to speak to. We can hardly expect readiness to immediately limit to 1 space capabilities for the sake of old fees. Military power is unfortunately once again received as a usable tool to achieve political goals by many actors. And the multipolarity we won't expect it to arrive is well, by number means a more peaceful environment again, unfortunately, but well, this is where we are now. However, this doesn't mean that discussing ones concerns and capabilities is anyway. My personal biggest expectation is that major actors in the field of well, if not space weapons, but space means capabilities. We'll be able to hear each other and avoid misperception and miscommunication of intended Signals in developing abilities. This is the only step or probably the first step that we can make right now to try to prevent the operation in outer space, although again, I understand the limits of what can be done at the moment. Then I'll stop and I'm looking forward to our discussion. Thank you.",0
S2M74,2,7,The Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Good morning and thank you for this invitation to brief you on these important issues. I'm very pleased to speak with you and I'm very grateful that you're all engaged in this important work of the OEWG, which is so timely. My apologies for not being able to make the journey in person, but I would be happy to continue discussions with any members and encourage you to contact me if you feel that I could be helpful. My e-mail address is available from the hosts. I'm a researcher for a non governmental organization. We see our role as supporting informed dialogue. And identifying new paths to save her safer, more sustainable and equitable world. In advocating that actors walk forward on these paths, they were. My home organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. We've been working in space security for all of those 50 years. However, the opportunities for progress wax and wane. And I think that we have a moment of opportunity in front of us and are just all to take it very seriously. My overall remarks on the topic of space to earth weapons. Consists of three points. One while they're perhaps the most alarming and provocative to think about, they're also militarily not particularly useful and are fairly unlikely to be pursued and foreseeable future. Second, such specifically designed weapons are likely to be recognizable, and for that reason limits on them are quite possible given sufficient interest and of course political will. And so hopes for a verifiable agreement, I think, are not, you know, remote. And three, despite these facts, there are also quite pressing immediate issues that that of course you have your attention on at the moment, issues of great importance. So I would urge you to balance the concerns about about where you put your attention and work. Because I'm a physicist by training, I'm really slicing my remarks on the technical aspects, which I hope that will help inform your deliberations. First, I'll just briefly talk about the technical reasons why Earth targeting space weapons have strong limits on utility. I'll try to separate the question Is it possible to target Earth from space? Which the answer is yes. From Is it likely or advantageous? Secondly, I'll describe some of the types of systems that have been proposed in the past and why they have not. We've not seen them actually put into factors. And 3rd I'll talk about whether such systems would be recognizable, verifiable weather limits on the feasible or desirable. So first, I think I know many of you have great experience in this. Just a reminder that while space is a place orbit as a condition and one that takes an enormous amount of energy to achieve, objects must not just be lifted up to a height above Earth, they must have the speed relative to the surface of the Earth sufficient to keep them there. And that speed at Orbitz close to the earth are very high, around 30 times the speed of a jet plane. This takes an enormous amount of energy. So if you pull into your mind the picture of a space launching rocket, enormous. Energetic event. Almost that entire rocket is fuel. It takes only three to 4% of the Massachusetts is actually the payload. It takes 45 tons of fuel to put a one ton satellite improvement. So this is a very expensive and energetically intensive process to put something into space. So there does need to be a compelling rationale to put an object in space rather than somewhere else. Despite space launch getting cheaper, it it will be an expensive event. When you can think of a satellite in orbit is more similar to a car going around a race track than an airplane that maneuvers by aerodynamic forces or by like an X wing fighter in this, you know, Star Wars movie. Using some unknown kind of physics, once you're in orbit it takes significant amounts of energy to to jump to a different or to bring yourself back down to Earth completely. For this reason that a weapon doesn't just drop back down to Earth, it takes a similar intensive amount of energy to return if you're going to return quickly and you have to carry that. That fuel up with you to order so. Again, that adds to your burden. So putting weapons into orbit to prepare them to target the ground is incredibly costly and well, and it has been described as a high ground advantage. That extraordinary expense must be justified in light of other ways to accomplish a similar purpose. And generally, those being in space is much less efficient than those other options, which is one reason we really haven't seen them to be developed in all of our years of space history. The transport of mass back and forth to orbit is very challenging. That's why in general, space operations are focused on the transmission and receipt of electromagnetic signals. That is their main purpose even today. Additionally, for a space based weapon to reach an appointed target on the ground at the high speeds characteristic of re-entry. Requires dedicated technology. An average satellite designed for another purpose will not have sufficient fuel to make a rapid descent back to Earth, nor the ability to really direct itself to a precision target. An average satellite cannot be easily repurposed into a ground attack weapon, so this problem you know, is limited. It isn't that anything in space can be used is such a weapon like this. Of course, some commentators expressed concern about space based directed energy weapons, particularly lasers. Of course these are these animate a lot of concerns because they are very provocative and sounding. They are also very challenging technically. In a similar way as bringing mass down from earth, the atmosphere absorbs and scatters light and cloud cover can be devastating to such such a weapon. The defense can defend themselves on the ground from such weapons very easily by introducing aerosols or dust or something else in the way of the laser. And again, laser systems in space would need to carry their own fuel. They couldn't be maintained in the way that that sophisticated machines normally would be on the ground, and again, very expensive. Another issue with space Earth weapons is that objects in space are moving rapidly with respect to the ground. And so they tend not to be where you want them when you want them. It's not like flying an airplane airplane to a destination on demand. This is sometimes called the absenteeism problem, meaning how many space objects would you need in order to have something in the right place at the right time for your mission? If your mission requires something to be ready at a moment's notice, or a few minutes notice, half hour notice, right the constellation, the number of satellites you can up very quickly, it's a it's a critical flaw in many of the plans to put weapons in space that need to have a rapid response, such as space based missile defenses. Which are meant to target, as my colleague Dmitri mentioned, nuclear carrying ballistic missiles as they are launched. The launch phase of intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as space launching vehicles are usually quite short, 3 to 4 minutes or shorter. So in order to have a defense against, for example, a single liquid fueled ICBM, one would need to have several 100 satellite based weapons. To defend against 10 simultaneously launched liquid fueled ICBM would require around. 4000 Weapons in space to ensure that there's something in place for each of those 10 municipals. That drives your system up to be fairly unreasonable levels fairly quickly. Despite optimistic assumptions about space launch getting less expensive, even the least capable of such a system would cost well over $100 billion. Beyond the high costs of such systems are critical, and perhaps the most important disadvantage of putting in weapons in space is that it makes them vulnerable. They're visible from the ground and they would be as vulnerable to interference, damage and destruction by anti satellite weapons in the same way as other space objects, including using ground based satellite weapon. Anti satellite weapons against this is the ability of such systems to protect themselves would be fairly limited. This is a key and mostly unchangeable characteristic of space based weapons. So again, while they would be. Extremely expensive and quite vulnerable, I would say, militarily. Probably ultimately useless. While the prospects of the US building a space based missile defense has generated great concern and many quarters, space based missile defense is not popular in the Pentagon. Hasn't been for a long time. The most recent director of the US Missile Defense Agency has stated that he has doubts about the cost effectiveness and technical prospects for such a system. None has ever been built, even in a test mode. It does continue to be considered in our political system due to a small number of congressional champions. But in the US political system, it would be extraordinarily difficult to get funding to build a real, fully realized system that would cost 10s or hundreds of billions of dollars to defend against even a few missiles. However, in the US political system, it's difficult to get a firm note on on things or to actually close the door on future options. So in summary, space physics disfavors missions that require the rapid transfer of mass in and out of orbit that require a rapid response, or remissions to require a safe harbor. What space is excellent for is Earth observation, and for the broadcast and receipt of of electromagnetic communications. And I I think space, space, Earth targeting weapons are likely to be a serious pursuit in the in the near future. They're uncompetitive with other means of just achieving the same objective. Because any such so my Third Point again, because any such weapon would need to be bespoke or tailored to its mission, they would require a significant amount of energy or fuel. They're likely to be recognizable upon inspection, The ability to rapidly deorbit a significant mass, the carrying of large mirrors for a laser, these would be easily recognizable by inspection, of course. The more intrusive inspections you can tolerate, the better you can under the better you can have confidence in your assessments. Additionally, space based weapons would need to be tested in order to have their have any confidence in them that such tests would also be observable. So we can have a great deal of confidence that these systems are not deployed today. Of course the systems are playing with more sophistication. Inspections would need to be more intrusive, but given that these weapons are impractical, expensive and difficult to defend. I think they're unlikely to confer a lasting advantage. Declaration is not going to be the first to deploy this. Weapons I think are actually welcome and I believe would be ultimately verifiable. But I believe the possibility of them becoming important military issue in the near term is remote, and there are many urgent space security issues which deserve your attention and the deliberations you're undertaking. I understand that progress in multilateral work can be slow and frustrating. I agree with my colleague Dimitri, but I do hope that you find a way to make the most of this time as these issues are so urgent. Since you know, I'd appreciate your questions.",0
S2M78,2,7,Canada,"Thank you very much Chair. My question is for the last presenter, Mr. Bowen from the University of Leicester. Thank you so much for your thought provoking. Presentation. I thought it was a really interesting way and very different way to think about the issues surrounding Peros. And I think particularly given the deadlock that we've seen on this issue for a very long time, I think it's very instructive to start thinking of ways that we can move beyond this. In your presentation you mentioned that we don't think of Peros in the air and naval domains and I was wondering if there if you could expand a little bit on that and if there are any lessons from these and other domains that we could use to help us get past this? Need to to think of Paris and outer space. Thank you.",2
S2M716,2,7,Italy,"Thank you, Mr. Chair and also thank thanks to all the panelists for their thought provoking presentations. And I also have a question to Professor Bowen. In your presentation you listed some examples of that can be considered as low hanging fruit, but can help us to progress. Do you think this can help us in our deliberations within this group and if you can elaborate a bit more on on this? Thank you.",3
S2M718,2,7,The Islamic Republic of Iran,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Today's topic is the most important topic of the meeting in our point of view. It would have been a lot better if the first topic discussed in this round of OEWG meeting was devoted to the threats from space to the Earth, since it is the main and most crucial threat that is made against countries violating their sovereignty. Accordingly, my question is in two parts. One with regard to the increasing integration of commercial and military space systems and the increase in hostile actions of countries with the militarization of space and violation of country sovereignty. Also with acknowledge that the ability to attribute threats from space to Earth being different according to the level of technological development of countries, how would that be possible to pursue the weak and unclear concept of responsible behavior against threats from space to earth to be pursued legally? Two, what is the stance and position of the natural and logical reaction of countries to defend their national sovereignty and taking countermeasures against space to Earth threats definable in the concept of responsible behavior? Thank you.",0
S2M724,2,7,Germany,"The Chair I would like to thank all panelists for their very insightful presentations. A common theme that appeared to come up several times was the the idea of incident prevention and risk reduction. And I think in in in this group we have been discussing quite extensively the question to what extent deca is an interplay between legally binding and voluntary measures. So I would like to ask you panellists, in a way, how they would see a beneficial interplay of both existing or new international. Binding instruments. And voluntary measures and TCBMS on the other side with regard to the threats they have identified. From space to space. Thank you.",2
S2M726,2,7,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thanked the panelists for their presentations. I'd like to ask 2 questions. One is on the space based missile defense technologies. Just now some experts mentioned this technology. We all know that some countries have been seeking to develop such capabilities. One certain country seek to develop a sought to develop such a capability. I'd like to ask panelists how they view such thread. And and if such threat can be termed as a threat from space to Earth. Second question. On the low hanging fruits mentioned by some panelists. Personally, I. It depends on the policies and the intentions of the major countries. If all countries are under good faith. And committed to peaceful use of outer space. Then naturally we can find those low hanging fruits. However, in fact, certain countries. Have defined outer space as a war fighting domain. And I'd like to ask the panelists how to persuade these countries to abandon such mentality. And how to persuade those countries? And to persuade them to think that outer space war, space war must not be fought and cannot be won. Thank you.",2
S2M734,2,7,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Chair, and Many thanks indeed to the panelists. I think this is a particularly useful exchange that we're having this morning. I certainly feel that we're learning a lot about some of the realities of the space domain, but also about some of the potential ways forward. And it's been really interesting to hear the panel's ideas about sort of so-called low hanging fruit. And panelists will have detected there's quite an appetite in the room for your ideas and it's been interesting to hear about some of the sort of more technical. Options for risk reduction in relation to standards and and and risk reduction measures and and I do feel that there's there's there's there's scope to. Do more work on those if the political will is there, as as panelists have have said, in a sort of bottom up way. And I just wonder if the panel could reflect perhaps a bit more on what scope you feel there could be for more sort of in a way top down. Commitments or. Confidence building statements. At the sort of political strategic level? Which states could make in order to reduce risk in the in the space domain and I have in mind particularly. Areas where certain activities might be seen by some states as inherently stabilising and confidence building, but perceived by other states as either threatening or or in some way irresponsible. And I feel that you know if there is scope to sort of reduce the scope for such sort of subjective. Subjectivity in threat perception that could also really help us to move forward. So really interested to hear if there are any thoughts on on that. Thank you very much.",2
S2M742,2,7,The Australian Center for Space Governance,"Thank you so much, Chair. And in fact, my question yesterday was addressed by others anyway, so I appreciate the opportunity to to speak. And I in fact wanted to return to the question raised by the delegate from China. Because if I understood the question correctly regarding the fact that some states describe space as a war fighting domain, this is not so much to do with whether we're talking about the possibility of a war taking place in space, but that there are some, a very small minority of nations who have. Included in their official strategies and policies, A determination that spaces a war fighting domain. And I wanted to return to it because I in fact agree with the Chinese delegation that this in and of itself could be destabilising. Language to be using if we're committed here to identifying responsible behaviours, norms of responsible behaviors and communication is something that keeps returning from all of these excellent panellists today and the discussions in the last couple of days. The way that we use language and communicate our intentions and our strategies in our official strategic and policy documents. Has incredible weight. And there are many, many other nations who've chosen to describe space as an operational domain. The NATO nations, excuse me, debated this in 2019 and undertook to describe space as operational. And I don't know of, excuse me, I don't know of other countries in other languages that describe space as war fighting. I apologize. So I I think I just wanted to under score the the call that the Chinese delegate made to think carefully about that official policy language. Because it can be destabilising. Or on the other hand, if we're agreeing on neutral terminology, that could in fact be a contributing factor to reducing threats in space.",2
S2M82,2,8,The Republic of Korea,"Mr. Chair, thank you for giving me the floor. I very much hope to be interactive. And I hope that me speaking on the topic three yesterday's issue doesn't. Distract the discussion so I will limit my intervention to and to only react to the interesting discussion point that went on yesterday, that is rendezvous in proximity operation RPO. As we have heard from yesterday's discussion, RPO operation is important for ensuring the sustainability of outer space activities. As such is the case for the on orbit surfacing and active debris removal. However, these capabilities are inherently of dual use and could be used to damage, degrade or destroy a satellite. It is also noted that any satellite capable of carrying out rendezvous in proximity operations and placed in the same orbit as another satellite could be regarded as a threat. Bearing in mind that you will use nature, we believe that it would be most effective to establish international practice to prevent misunderstanding and miscommunication. And in doing so, we would not be in favor of regulating such capability, just as our German and Philippines colleagues pointed out yesterday, but rather lean toward agreement upon a set of guidelines and principles on the practice of carrying out RPO, including pre notification and consultation. We acknowledge already existing guidelines from civil area. And the discussion going on within Kopus from the safety aspect. We look forward to working with this group on how to further contribute to enhancing the security aspect. Thank you.",0
S2M84,2,8,Russia,"Thank you very much, distinguished Chair. Yesterday, numerous delegations. Spoke in favor of having an interactive discussion and dialogue. And my delegation fully supports. Such an approach, and we believe that this is exactly what we need to have here. Interactive dialogue, if indeed. We hope to reach agreement and find some common understandings. We would also like to point out the statement yesterday by the Delegation of Canada. And I think quite a few remember what was said. But would like to express the hope that. The statement that was made by that delegation, which included some examples, where in the view of that delegation. Some norms of international law. Are violated. We do hope that. That that is not aimed at stating that international law is simply useless. Because otherwise. If that argument were to be used, then it would mean that whatever norms can be adopted. They would be violated anyway. And we believe the country is correct. We believe that. What we need to do is to stick to a purely legal approach. And strictly comply with the norms of international law that. Are already in place. Only through this. Type of approach. We can prevent a negative development in different areas. Including outer space. Also, many things were said about the need to define threats and dangers. And here we believe that there's some confusion. Including. In light of the views expressed by some delegations. Who said that no such definitions exist at the international level and will be very difficult to elaborate them? And here we would like to support the delegation of Egypt that was very clear and very direct when it said that we need to development, we need to develop a unified terminology. At the international level, in order to come up with a common understanding that we could use. During our discussions. On questions related to International Space law. Now on the definitions of threats and dangers. Well, this in fact does exist in Russian legislation. And our delegation. Fully uses in our work the understanding that we have enshrined at the national level. In particular, we are ready to repeat that when we talk about military threat, we consider that to be the state of Interstate or intrastate relations. That is characterized by a whole set of factors that may in certain conditions. Lead to a military threat or the appearance of a military threat. And in this, the notion of a military threat. Is defined by us as a state of relations between states or in states inside states. That is characterized by the real possibility. Of a military conflict between opposing sides. With a high level of readiness of a state or a group of states. Separate terrorist organizations. To use. Force or armed force, Armed violence. So for. Us these notions are very clear, these definitions and. The Russian Federation will be using this understanding. As we continue our work here in this open-ended working. Group related to issues of outer space. As I said earlier, we support a purely legal approach. In this working group. And this also relates to the objectives and goals that our group faces. In this. The notion of intentions. The notion of understanding or reception. Perceptions. Are of a non legal nature. These are subjective notions. And here are several delegations, already raised some questions. Who will determine who will make the opinion about who is right? What assessment regarding intentions is the correct one? And as I said, although these are not legal categories or notions, and hardly can they be used. For any decisions that can be taken. And even less so for any determination of the consequences of such actions. Moreover. A strictly legal approach is also important. From the point of view of the need to determine. Whether this is indeed the action is a subject for any legal assessment or a subject for consideration within the context of international law. Yesterday we said quite a few things about different crimes. We carried out and determined similarities with situations where. In the tool of a crime, ice was used. But. Here we would like to look at the category of the actual substance of a crime. Or or the actual illegal action or activity. And this, first of all relates to dangerous rendezvous in space. Now if we take a situation where. Two space vehicles move closer to one another, so the very this very fact is not an illegal step or action. Cases of such proximity maneuvers. Cannot be considered as an legal step. Because. This movement closer does not represent the substance of any crime. Any component elements of a crime related to a rendezvous will only be. As such, if as a result of such in proximity movement, illegal actions were committed in the context of International Space law. But until the point that that actually happens. There are no elements of a crime and we cannot talk about any violation of the norms of International Space law. And the attempts that are made to say that A certain way of perceiving such a dangerous rendezvous already in itself creates. A certain violation of law. In essence, is an attempt to review existing norms of International Space law. And for my delegation. This is something that we cannot accept. This is why. Based on the Space Treaty. And on the basis of existing norms of International Space law. As we have said on several occasions during this session. The criteria for determining whether certain actions are illegal or not, or whether they're responsible or irresponsible. The criteria. Is only linked to the fact whether such steps or actions are carried out for peaceful purposes or not. Now on the different categories of dangers or threats. Well, here we believe that we really shouldn't focus so much on dual use systems. And create the impression that. All systems that are space based or have anything to do with space faring activities are in fact dual use systems. That is not the case. There's an entire category of means and systems. That are being used for very clear purposes. That and these purposes are. Purely of a non peaceful nature. And as far as that category of systems? Is concerned, we believe that there is no problem to take certain measures or impose certain prohibitions. And restrictions. Now if we are talking about dual use systems. Then, in cases involving such systems, we also should apply the criteria that I referred to earlier. If a dual use system is used for peaceful purposes. Then there are no problems here, no problems arise and there are no illegal actions or violations. However, if the system is not used for peaceful purposes, then. Naturally. This leads to illegal steps and violations. And in all of this. We we should base our approaches on existing. In norms of International Space law, especially the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. Otherwise, we will find ourselves in a situation of certain anarchy when each country can interpret any activities in the way that it wants to interpret them. And we will have. No single measuring stick that we could use. Whether a violation of existing norms exists or there is no such violation. Now we would like to refer to an issue that was raised by many delegations yesterday. That quite selectively. Tried to identify certain systems and means. That give rise to concerns. Or different types of activities that can rise to concern. And as an example, I can give you a situation related to rendezvous. For some delegations. Now if we look at the space to space dimension, only situations involving rendezvous. Relate to activities that may give rise to concerns. And we find this a bit strange. However, we believe that selective approach, if we talk about norms of international law and especially if we talk about questions of International Security and strategic disability, this is. An unacceptable approach because if we follow this path based on a selective approach, then we will have situations where one. Privileged group of straights will obtain some advantages and. Another group of countries will not have such advantages, and moreover. There, the security of these states may be undermined. As a result of such decisions, and all of this leads to only one thing, such selective measures lead to one thing. This leads to a new spiral of the arms race, because states that will not obtain certain advantages will be forced to take measures in order to compensate. Their lagging behind. Or. The fact that they do not have such advantages in comparison to other countries that do have or would have obtained any advantages, and this is the reason why the Russian Federation. Is. Promoting A comprehensive approach related to outer space. And also in connection with the activities that are carried out in outer space and of a military nature. And This is why if we look at the space to space segment. This is why we are urging. Countries not to look at all space. Objectives not involve all space objectives or space objects as means for attacking targets on the ground. In airspace and outer space. This will. Fully cover. Those issues that were raised by delegations yesterday. It includes. Fully all hypothetical situations where as a result of a rendezvous. Harm against space objects of another country may arise. But moreover. This also will cover many other hypothetical situations related to. Non kinetic impact. Linked to Kinetic impact. Without the consideration of any. Separate hypothetical scenarios. Moreover, if we looked at the space, the space segment here. We would like to remind you of our proposal to place a ban on the testing deployment of weapons in outer space. In order to carry out different tasks, including ABM defense, something that no one referred to yesterday and that we believe is extremely serious. Serious factor. Including anti satellite weapons. And this also covers weapons in space that can be used against targets on the ground or in airspace. And moreover. We also are calling. Or urging states to destroy existing systems of this type. Now also under the space to space segment we find situations. Related to the band on the creation, testing, deployment, and use of space weapons for ABM defense. And as ASAP weapons and also to if they're used against targets on the ground or in airspace, and this also relates to the ban that we are proposing. On the destruction or damage. Or violation of the normal operations of a change of trajectories of space objects of other countries. And here we ensure complete coverage or response to the concerns that were raised related to any changes in the trajectory of space projects or attempts to remove them from orbit. As you see, our proposals cover all the concerns that were raised here that we heard, but they are not selective in their nature. They're comprehensive. And they cover any hypothetical situations, problematic situations that may occur in outer space, but also in other areas, including. On the ground. Also, another point that we would like to refer to is the references that we hear quite often, references to the information that experts are providing during this informal segment. We are grateful to experts representing NGOs, independent experts for the vision that they're sharing with us the assessments that. They make during our morning informal sessions. Nevertheless. We. Cannot really only rely on these statements, believe that it is the ultimate truth and on the basis of what is said by our experts, make conclusions I think that would be. Something that. Will be carried away in all of this and this will be really short sighted. Because, as I said earlier, this just represents the views of these individual experts, nothing else. And as we saw yesterday, some of these opinions or views may be based on. Severely limited range of open sources. And it's quite possible that these sources. Have a certain bias. They also may have a certain nationality, if I may put it so. So This is why we would like to urge delegations to show great care. When they? Use the views and assessments made by independent experts. And. Would warn delegations against using such assessments as the ultimate truth. And also another very important aspect that we would like to highlight relates to attempts made by many delegations to discuss here in this form of the open-ended working room. To present problems here that are being discussed during meetings of copus in Vienna. In particular, this relates to the problem of space debris. And we see that this is happening not only during this meeting. This also took place during the May meeting of the open and working group. And in this respect? We'd like to. Remind delegations that the work being carried out in COPAS has been going on for many, many years on these very issues and we shouldn't underestimate that work. On the contrary, we should focus on the continuation of that work. In back way back in 2007 in COP. There was agreement on some guiding principles on the reduction of space debris, something that was presented to the UN General Assembly. In 2019. The committee adopted the preamble and 21 guiding principles on ensuring. Long term sustainability of space activities. Also a profile working group or a special working group was created. With the task of identifying and studying problems. Related to the preparation of new guiding principles. And ensuring long term sustainability of space activities And the committee made a recommendation to the group to use in its work. Documents that reflect the. Almost decade of discussions that took place between Member States related to the safety of space operations. Would like to also highlight the fact that the working Group on Long Term sustainability of Space Activities that is functioning under the auspices of COPAS, is currently considering the problem of the interference in the exploitation of foreign space objects. As well as the removal of space debris from near Earth orbits. The development of criteria and procedures of carrying out space activities. And all of this is based on the experience that has been accumulated during many years of work in Copas And This is why we believe that threats and dangers related to activities in outer space for peaceful purposes. And any related activities should be considered in Copas. That has the necessary mandate to do that work. Otherwise, there will be a duplication of efforts, or in some way we'll be replacing that activity with new interpretations that are not in line with the documents and understandings that have been reached in copus. So we'd like to avoid that from happening. And we believe that we should work in parallel fields, the work being carried out in Vienna and also the work that we're carrying out here related directly to what is being discussed in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. Problematic computing The problem of overlapping mandates for Copperas and this group was raised at the 65th session of Copperas Bias this June in Vienna. And we had the support of a number of states on that score and as a result, it was decided to have a detailed discussion of this situation during the joint sessions of the 1st and 4th committees of the General Assembly. On the 27th of October in New York And we are quite convinced that this open-ended working group. Needs to focus on 1st committee issues renting an arms right in outer space. The risks and threats deriving from the militarization of outer space. And not peaceful uses of outer space. And that's that. Subject. Under the purview of Coppolas, everything related to peaceful usage of outer space. And issues reflected in the committee decision adopted before the establishment of the working group. That should be dealt with solely in Vienna. Corpus and corpus. That's we need to stop diluting the couples mandate. Which is in fact the soul, the unique area for discussing the urgent issues relating to the development and exploration of outer space. That's separating out with coordination between the two for. Is fully in keeping with the terms of reference of the first committee. And the decisions of the 1st special session. In 17/19/78. And is also in keeping directly with the mandate of the UN Committee on Outer Space. Thank you.",4
S2M86,2,8,Austria,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. At the outset, and since this is our first intervention, and with this we will also be interrupting a little bit Interactive section of our discussion and I apologize for this in advance. At the outset, Mr. Chair, we want to thank you as well as your team for the organization of this meeting and for for providing us with another round of excellent panelists. We also want to commend you for the summary of your of our last meeting you have provided in your own capacity which will be very useful for our future work. Austria lands itself with the statement delivered by the European Union and the written contributions submitted. In addition, we would like to share some remarks in our national capacity which are of a general nature and touch several agenda points of this week. Mr. Chair, Austria remains concerned about the developments in outer space and their possible repercussions on security and stability, as well As for the people and societies on Earth. Our discussions in May already showcase the wide range of problems, from the significant risks caused by space debris to the complexities related to dual use and an overall need for additional norms, rules and principles. The complexity of security issues in outer space is increasing for an unprecedented advancement in technology, which will continue, even accelerate, in the future. We are witnessing a new era of space faring as well as an increasing dependency on services provided throughout the space systems. The infrastructure in space, which is closely interconnected with our economies, our societies and our security, deserves maximum protection. We want to underline once again that the highly disruptive potential of malicious space operations, be it interorbital or ground to orbit, entails significant repercussions on civilians on Earth by impacting healthcare, transportation, communication or energy. Mr. Chen, our deliberations this week we are focusing on risks and threats in and for outer space. The situation in outer space, which is increasingly congested and contested, creates a growing perception of threats, which in turn increases the potential for misunderstandings and possible escalation. Security challenges like these require multilateral answers and we appreciate the possibility to discuss them within the framework of the OWT. This is all the more important as space related matters and other disarmament for our remain in persistent deadlock. As others have pointed out, the discussions in the OWG itself contribute to a confidence building measure, and lead can be considered as a confidence building measure and lead to increased common understanding of threats and threat perception. Related to this, we see a clear necessity to improve information sharing and the purpose of space objects and the intention of operations, as well as the respective mechanisms. This could, for example, point to the need for a strengthened implementation of the conventional and registration of objects launched in outer space of 1974. But in general, and in particular in the context of dual use, we lack multilateral means for attribution and verification related to space objects, which we should rectify, inter alia through the means of newly available available technology. Transparency and confidence building measures are important instruments to start mitigating several of the above mentioned risks, decrease the perception of threats, and have a positive impact towards responsible behavior in outer space. We encourage spacefaring nations to improve information sharing on operations on their national policies and make use of SSA capabilities as well as the relevant provisions of The Hague Code of Conduct. We further require standards and norms related to the behaviour in outer space and the strengthening of existing instruments. Recall our previous discussions on the principles of gear regard and see merit in further work on the interpretation of possible operation operation operas, sorry, operationalization of Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty. Mr. Chair, we recognise the benefits of a behavior based approach for our work due to the inherent dual use nature of many space systems which requires a better understanding of possible threats and their perception. But at the same time we should not lose sight of the capabilities themselves which by nature underpin most of the space related space related behaviour and are a technological necessity for several of the threats. Work in this field should also not exclude the possibility of illegally banning instrument in the future. We hope that this week will not only be a discussion about threats as such, but a genuine exchange on what kind of behaviors in outer space states consider as threatening or irresponsible. At this point, let me once again express our appreciation for the inclusiveness and the multi stakeholder approach in the OEWT an advantage over other processes which we should take advantage of. Mr. Chair, as to the specific threats and risks, we are particularly concerned about the development and testing of kinetic anti satellite antisatellite capabilities. They endanger the peaceful use of outer space for any current and future spacefaring nations by the creation of space debris must be considered an irresponsible behavior. In addition, the conduct of such tests per SE can be seen as threatening towards other space actors and have destabilising effects. We therefore welcome the commitment by the US and other States to ban all anti satellite missile tests and announcements of others to follow suit. Rendezvous operations as well as proximity operations have the potential for misunderstandings as it is difficult to determine intent and due to concerns caused by dual use capabilities. A concrete outcome of our work could be an understanding on how to conduct rendezvous and proximity operations in a way that they are not considered as threatening behaviour. The conduct of non kinetic attacks and cyber warfare in outer space an outer space systems is extremely concerning as it is difficult to assert an accountability and responsibility for such attacks. The damage to space systems and the disruption of services through Direct Energy capabilities, electromagnetic interferences, jamming, spoofing or cyber attacks often have impacts beyond the initial target and is highly irresponsible. In this context, we recall the cyber attack against the commercial satellite one hour before Russia's unjustified and illegal invasion in Ukraine, which not only had repercussions for military actors in Ukraine but also for civilian infrastructure. In different European countries. Mr. Chair, in relation to many of the aforementioned threats, we are particularly concerned about the reverberating effects any disruption or destruction of infrastructure in outer space could have on our society's economies as well as on human life. As outlined by the ICRC, the impact of attacks on space systems could be far reaching and the potential consequences of military space operations a matter of humanitarian concern. Critical infrastructure dependent on outer space systems must be protected and we are of the view that international law, including the principles of international humanitarian law, fully apply in outer space. Let me conclude by assuring you of our readiness for further in-depth discussion within the mandate of this open-ended working group. And we will provide additional remarks in the course of our further discussions. Thank you.",0
S2M88,2,8,Russia,"Thank you, Sir. I am obliged to take the floor on a point of order in connection with the unfounded, provocative and politicized statement made by the delegation of Austria on the. Special military operation in the Ukraine. I do understand that delegations wish to discuss the issue, and we can prepare a statement in order to give some detailed explanations of all of this. We consider that these comments on the part of the Delegation of Austria do not correspond to the Rules of Procedure Rule 68. In particular, they don't correspond to the focus, the mandate of the group and are not up for discussion under this item on the agenda, namely 6B, topic 6B. Yet again, Sir, we do request that you call delegations, in this particular case delegation of Austria to order. And that people stick strictly to the subject designated under agenda item 6B. Thank you.",2
S2M810,2,8,Netherlands,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Before I will go into more detail on yesterday's topic of space to space threats, I would like to state that we fully support commands made yesterday afternoon by our Canadian colleagues. 1st, we believe that the emphasis should be on behavior rather than capabilities, also because we do not want to curb the legitimate use of space assets for civil, social, economic and developmental purposes. Second, it is obvious to the Netherlands that IHL applies in outer space as it does on Earth. We also share the view that was expressed by the German delegation that military use of space is not prohibited and can be distinguished from the weaponization of space, which we clearly oppose. Mr. Chair, our delegation joins others in expressing our concern with regards to the developments in the field of Co Orbital and the satellites, weapons and security implications of rendezvous and proximity operations. Using satellites to approach or make physical contact with other operational satellites by means of rendezvous and proximity operations. Without the permission of the owner of the satellite that is the target of the operation. Can, in certain cases be considered irresponsible behavior. This is not a hypothetical issue, as the Netherlands has come to know in the recent past. Other responsible actions include the intentional hindering of a space object in orbit. And forcing it to perform an evasive maneuver. Such maneuvers cause precious fuel and hence reduce the lifetime of a satellite. The same holds for intentionally rendering satellite orbits unusable by intentionally dispersing uncontrollable space debris in those orbits. Mr. Chair, we have heard from panelists that developments in these fields continue at speed. And that these require our attention. The Netherlands does not advocate duplicating existing efforts by the international community to guarantee the safe, secure and sustainable use of outer space. We believe that it would be unwise to allow, and would be unwise to allow, the important and practical work that needs to be done by the international community to be delayed by mere procedural discussions. Transparency about space operations such as launches and maneuvers is key, as we have also heard this morning. This can already be achieved in part through various existing mechanisms. Including the timely provision of information to the United Nations Register of objects launched into outer space. Also worthy of particular attention in this context, also as mentioned by the Austrian delegation, is The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation. Through the standing forum, of which this year marks his 20th years of existence. States inform each other not only about launches of spacecraft, but also on space policies that may cover activities relevant for our discussions. For all the purposes of the code, its full globalization will provide a further and substantive contribution in the field of space security. We can also make good use of the work being done in other international forum that deal with space issues. For example, in the realm of space traffic management. And by the work done by commercial actors, as we have heard yesterday morning. Such further practical ways forward will undoubtedly be discussed in more detail during the next session of this open-ended working group. Thank you.",0
S2M812,2,8,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. China is off the view that the space to space threat is mainly from the space based counter space weapons. Including the following activities. One make irresponsible space decision and war preparation. Including the military doctrine that focuses on space war preparation, construction of space military force, and direct counter space operations. For instance. After establishing the US space Force, the US in its space operation command establishes the delta line. Whose mission is to conduct counter space operations. And actively prepare for an outer space weapon test range. This squadron has also has also done multiple secret secret tests with X37B aircrafts. But refuses to disclose any details. For the fiscal year 2023, the US Space Force has a total budget of 27.6 billion U.S. dollars, increasing by 7 billion U.S. dollars compared to 20/22. The budget contains a large amount of classified items, which increase from 4.47 billion U.S. dollars in 2022 to 4.973 billion U.S. dollars. Two deploy SSA satellites in Geo areas. To continuously conduct. Close reconnaissance. Appeal and other dangerous activities against other countries aircrafts. According to the report of Safer World Foundation since 2016. The US GSEB satellite has been has been dangerously close to the satellites of China, Russia, Pakistan, Nigeria and other countries for 10 times. The shortest distance was only 10 kilometers, where collisions were so easy to happen. Three, develop unknown operation and control capabilities. The USDA RPA actively promotes the robotic servicing of geosynchronous satellites. And checks the on operation technologies such as catching, dissembling and manufacturing. AUS commercial company develops and deploys 2 Mevs. To conduct OPIO catch and other maneuvers against other unobtrated satellites in the name of life extension. Given the dual youth nature of such technologies, the space catch operation and control capabilities can be easily transformed into counter space measures. Four developed space based missile defense technologies. For instance, seek the booster face ballistic missile interception capabilities. Developed space based weapon platform. And test. Based interceptors and directed energy weapon related technologies. Such actors will directly introduce weapons into space, which severely violates the principle of peaceful use of outer space. In addition, during the meetings these days, some countries have expressed their concern over the over development of commercial constellations in Liu areas. The explosive growth of the constellations will generate multiple risks, including producing numerous debris in space. Increasing the coalition risk, occupying frequency and orbit resources, and squeezing the space launching window. This would seriously undermine the peaceful use of outer space by all countries around the world, especially by developing countries. Also, some commercial aerospace companies participate in military activities. This not only blurs the division between military and civil activities, but also objectively exacerbates the expansion of space arms. Which will not help prevent arms race in the outer space and maintain peace in the outer space. Such act is equivalent to space to space threat. According to the International Space law, a state should undertake international obligations for its space activities, activities including those carried out by non government entities. Therefore, all countries have the responsibility and duty to regulate the activities of their commercial airspace companies. Mr. Today, most countries still have limited SSA capability. And this gives a chance to 1 superpower to devote lots of efforts to secret military activities in space and to develop and deploy counter space weapons. This severely threatens the peace and security in space. And greatly increases the risk of military misjudgment and conflict in space. Actually, compared to the Earth to space threats, the space to space threats are more invisible, more diversified. And have a higher risk of conflict and confrontation. The international community should give equally high attention to this issue. Especially after the US establishing its orbit force. The superpower shows very clear intention to use or threaten to use force in outer space. Since 2017, the US Space Force has carried out 14 spaceflight drills. To exercise the possible confrontation scenarios in the space. Some countries in their statements stressed the civil use or the positive side of the RPO and other on bit technologies. IE they could be used for aircraft on orbit, life extension, debris removal. Asteroid defense and other youth and would help the space environment governance. Yet As for their potential military use or their threat to other countries, space asset security, the countries were unwilling to say much. We cannot say that because space technologies have due use nature, then we could sit by and watch the superpowers act of militarizing the space. While ensuring that all developing countries can peacefully use these technologies, we should seek a legally binding solution to stop the superpower making use of the onorbit operation technologies to use or threaten to use force in space. During the recent days, many colleagues mentioned verification issue. China is of the view that the SSA technology could be a potential method for verification in space. It could play a certain role in detecting and tracing the orbits and features of space objects. Verification should be politically accepted. Technically feasible and economically affordable. It also requires to establish a complete legal system as a support, identify who shall authorize and take the lead and clarify the legal basis for verification activities. Without a comprehensive legal system as a support, the so-called verification of behaviors in space may easily become a political tool for some technically advantageous countries. Mr. Chair. China believes that to address whatever space to space threat, the fundamental way is a legally binding method to prohibit the deployment of weapons in outer space. And the PPWT draft submitted by China and Russia during the CD provides a solution for the international community. The country with the most powerful space capabilities should abandoned the Cold War mindset and join the negotiation of the instrument on arms control in outer space with a responsible attitude. Only in this way could we keep outer space A pure land and achieve common security and safe cooperation. Lastly, I'd like to comment on the ICE merger case mentioned by Cuba and Canada yesterday.  China agrees with these statements made by Russia just now. In this discussion. In addition to the weapon and action of murder. The murderous intention and consequence caused are also very important elements to consider. Of course, there should be a fundamentally important prerequisite. IE the must be laws that clearly stipulate that murder is illegal and is strictly prohibited unless out of self-defense. If the law has flaws, then we should make efforts to improve the law rather than arbitrarily interpret the law. So is the space security issue. Only by respecting and maintaining the existing international law and making efforts to fill in the gaps could we truly resolve the fundamental threat of arms race in outer space. Some countries mentioned in the working paper. That even if an action is lawful under the international law, in some contexts such an act may be viewed as irresponsible. May be viewed as irresponsible. China thinks this view is questionable. The Yuan Charter, Outer Space Treaty and other relevant international laws are the basic norms that regulate behaviors in outer space. All countries compliance with the international law when conducting space activities is the basic demonstration of being responsible. If a lawful action can be deemed as irresponsible, then could the unlawful actions be seen as responsible? Yesterday, some countries pointed out that an identification of responsible behaviors may also lead up to new international law and legally binding instrument. But the problem is such identification is very subjective and belongs to ethnic norms by nature. Before ascertaining the application of law to 1st subjectively judge which actions are responsible and which are not. This is inconsistent with the spirit of rule of law and also derogate the value of international law. Ethical norms should never override or be above the illegal standards. On the table now there is a draft treaty on arms control in outer space. And why don't we discuss about that? Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M814,2,8,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to begin by stating unequivocally that Canada believes that respect for international law is of paramount importance and we would not suggest otherwise in Word or indeed. The fact that some states may breach obligations contained in international law does not mean that that law is irrelevant or useless. Instead, international law is a mechanism by which we can hold states accountable. For their breaches of international law. Further. International law contains rights and obligations specifically designed to address and manage incidents of breaches of international law. One of the prime examples in the UN Charter, of course, is that we have a prohibition on the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state, and we have a corresponding right in Article 51. Of self-defense. In addition to that, we have an entire body of law, namely international humanitarian law, which regulates and manages the prosecution of conflicts that can originate from an unlawful use of force. However. Some colleagues have pointed out the distinction between unlawful behavior and lawful behavior and claim that that's where it should end. This is not so. Between lawful behavior, which respects existing international law, and unlawful behavior, which does not. There is a wide range of behaviors. Some of those behaviors could be considered responsible and thus are conducive to the maintenance of international peace and security. Other behaviors are not. It is those behaviors that are not conducive to international peace and security, understanding and peaceful coexistence that could be labeled irresponsible. Some have objected or claimed that the terms responsible or irresponsible are subjective in that they cannot be used. They are not fair and are perhaps discriminatory based on cultural values or norms. But from Canada's point of view, it is the very work of this open-ended working group. To discuss these behaviors and attempt to alleviate the ambiguity. To clarify the norms. To attempt to remove the subjectivity and provide some measure of objectivity and understanding about what is considered responsible and irresponsible. To remove this ambiguity, to create a common understanding so that we don't have some delegations or countries questioning whether behavior is responsible or not. That is one of the purposes of this open-ended working group. That's the work we're here to do and it's very important work. Yesterday afternoon, the distinguished representative Egypt posed a good question. How does our work fit in with the overall goal of maintaining space security? To answer that question, we can look back a little bit at the history of the development of international law and it will help guide us and situate where we are today. Obviously, at the beginning of the space age there was number international law, there was an absolute lack and there would have been a sense of urgency and there was to develop an international legal framework to govern this new area of human activity. However, the first products that came out of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space was not a comprehensive treaty. In fact, it was a series of resolutions which contained various bits and pieces of what we now recognize as International Space law. It was through the development of these principles that were adopted in resolutions, non binding resolutions of the General Assembly over time that helped develop International Space law. Some examples include Resolution 1721, A&B, where states began to articulate principles such as the application of international law to outer space. Including the UN Charter. That outer space and celestial bodies should be free for exploration and use by all states. The concept of registering space objects. These came out of non binding resolutions at first. And then further in 1963? Resolution 1884 was adopted. That resolution called on states from refraining to place weapons of mass destruction in orbit. Again, this was a non binding resolution, but it had normative value and it played a very important role in shaping the behaviors of states in the coming years. Then there was the adoption of Resolution 1962 in 1963. Confusingly, that coalesced many of these principles that had already been looked at into one resolution. And then four years after that, we had the Outer Space Treaty, which enshrined many of those principles which were at first non binding but normative in character. Into existing international law. But even that wasn't the end, because we then had subsequent treaties. Rescue and return agreement liability Convention, Registration Convention that provided further detail and clarity to the general principles that were found in the Outer Space Treaty. So it's a continuing process. It's always evolving And the purpose of the work here in discussing ways of reducing threats. Through norms and principles of responsible behavior. Fits into the global objective of space security. By creating an agreement on these basic principles, non binding at first, but normative and character with great value, that can then help us follow the same path that was followed in the past towards binding International Space law. So it's not that this is an end. This open-ended working group or whatever comes after is not the end, it's the beginning. And some delegations have referenced the fact that the pledge not to conduct. Destructive direct descent ASAP tests is only one step. It's not sufficient, it's only one step. But I believe there is a fairly famous saying that a journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step. And so we take that step and then we take another step in this OWG through elaborating responsible behaviors and we take another step after that and we get closer towards the ultimate goal. So that's really how the work of the OEWG fits in with the greater goal. This is 1 amongst many steps or perhaps a bridge towards the goal to help us get where we ultimately want to go, which is to improve space security for the benefit. Of all. Thank you, Mr.",4
S2M816,2,8,The United Arab Emirates,"The Chairman, as this is our first time addressing the working group, I would like to thank thank you, Mr. Chairman and the Secretary for the excellent choice of the panelists who have who have contributed extensively in advancement of our discussion in this working group. As such, we would like also to thank all Member States for their constructive contribution in the discussion of the working group. Mr. Chairman, my delegation welcome the second session of the open-ended working group and believes that the valuable outcome of our discussion will contribute in making safe, secure and sustainable outer space for all Member States. My country affirms its full support and cooperation towards the successful work of this working group. Today, more than ever, the world is dependent on space, technologies, significant drivers for national peace and prosperity. The UA utilized outer space for the advancement of its National Science and technology. Also, the UAE firmly believes in maintaining outer space for peaceful uses only. We also acknowledge the right of Member States to develop their capabilities and space systems and peaceful manner. States with emerging and developing space programs should be given the opportunity to develop their space programs to support social and economic sustainable development. Therefore, careful attention should be given when drafting legally and non legally binding principles that require technical complexity. The existing international law provides basis for framework to reduce peace threats. Risk and new instruments are needed. The equal and fair access to space is also an important element to be considered when defining norms, responsible principal and verification method that addressed threats in space systems. To conclude, Mr. Chairman, the United Arab Emirates affirms its commitment towards the international efforts and disarmament and non proliferation in outer space. In addition, we continuously encourage Member States to actively participate in these commitments. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",1
S2M818,2,8,Pakistan,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and following the footsteps of delegations before me, I wish to express some points on the topic in a discussion and some additional points. Which are general in nature. Mr. Chairman, my delegation appreciates your leadership of this open and networking group. I also thank panelists for their valuable contributions. The outer space is undergoing significant technological developments in several aspects, ranging from peaceful exploration to development of new assets and capabilities. Our reliance on space based objects for a diverse activity of contemporary life has immensely increased. This has made all of us a stakeholder in what happens in space. Accordingly, relevant mechanisms and institutions with specific mandates have been in existence to ensure that outer space remains a global common for all people and states. These international mechanisms are underpinned by universal principles and norms to control, regulate and in some cases, prohibit activities incompatible with the peaceful uses of this distant space. Yet risks and threats to peaceful use of outer space have grown, along with growing interest of States and non state actors in utilizing outer space for their economic and security objectives. The threat spectrum is magnified by the growing integration of surveillance capabilities, weapons, technologies, platforms and dedicated force structures in the nuclear, cyber, conventional and outer space domains. The mutually reinforcing nature of defensive and offensive capabilities, such as the deployment of missile defense systems. And their integration with outer space systems. Represents yet another layer of threats to strategic stability at the global and regional levels. In the absence of commensurate legal constraints, the system provides space for preemptive and disarming strikes against terrestrial systems, entailing serious consequences for safety, security and sustainability at Earth and in outer space. The line between peaceful and military uses of outer space is getting blurred and not as non governmental actors. Themselves are no longer singularly confined to his peaceful exploitation. We also noticed that militaries of a growing number of countries have now established dedicated space commands and integrated new and at times unclear concepts in their doctrinal sphere, such as extending deterrence to outer space. Given these developments, the OWG needs to comprehensively examine the full array and nature of new threats that are kinetic as well as non kinetic from capabilities in various orbital situations, direct ascent capabilities, as well as those from other terrestrial systems. Miss Yemen, the existing normative and legal architecture governing the security aspects of our outer space is construed to keep pace with the developments in the real world. Unsurprisingly, the international community has consistently called for further measures. An appropriate international negotiations to prevent an arms race in the outer space. This illustrates that existing international legal framework remains insufficient. In being a guidance for so-called responsible behavior in reducing space threats or preventing an arms race and weaponization of outer space. Unfortunately, the conference on DISARM and has long been prevented from starting negotiations on Parros. Despite increased evidence of growing risks to peaceful use of outer space, some states continue to obstruct commencement of pearls negotiations to this day, citing concerns which can be addressed during serious work. Mr. Chairman, in this context, how can this OEWG contribute towards reducing space threats to norms, rules and principles? We must begin by stressing the centrality of three core principles, and they are reaffirmation by by this group. First, the principal enshrined in the Outer Space Treaty, that use of outer space for the benefit and in the interest of all countries. Second, the cardinal principle of ensuring equal security for all states. And 3rd the primary responsibility of states with significant military capabilities, with the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Building on these, we expect the OWG to proceed to the crucial issue of how to start Pro's negotiations. We believe that norms, rules and principles, even behaviors, can be examined during. The long, long overdue treaty and negotiations on Paris. Mr. Chairman, the concept of promoting responsible behaviors as a sole solution to new and concrete space threat remains vague and efficient at best. Having said that, we look forward to OWG developing arrangements, sorry, agreement, that is, that its conceptualization of behaviors vis a vis space security is directly linked to the notion of capabilities and intertwined with which capabilities are developed. Deployed and potentially used, especially in the light of the Cardinal principles of the outer Speciality of 1967. Therefore, one of the norms that this OWG should look at developing is the prohibition of placement of weapons other than WMDS in outer space, that is, weapons. That could be used to engage targets on Earth, in air or in outer space, as well as the use of force against outer space objects from Earth or from air. We also propose that in its upcoming work, the OWG should continue to explore the nature of the arms race in outer space and its impacts on international and regional security. Elaborate measures that can help reduce space threats, including those arising from militarization and weaponization of outer space. And finally, exploring recommendations on elements of an international legally binding instrument on paras. Mr. Chairman, achieving space security requires A holistic approach. Envisage is credible and legally binding tools. The current trends of increase in capabilities, reliance and space space based assets and growth in number of space capable actors necessitates development of an early legal instrument. We look forward to constructive engagement with other allegations in developing a common path forward towards mitigation of space threat for everyone. I thank you.",4
S2M820,2,8,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I apologize. My delegation apologizes for confusing you with multiple speakers. I have a prepared intervention with regard to topic #4, I believe, which is about space to earth, threats, current and future. But I can't help but be compelled to return to more general topic, and I'm prompted here by the distinguished delegate of. Of Canada with regard to the. How transcending existing International Space law in our discussion does not necessarily place a subjective ethical perspectives above the law, nor does it undermine the rule of law. And here I just wish to register my delegations position that we subscribe to the view that conversations to alleviate the ambiguity with regard to the principles and norms actually enrich the the enrich the structures of international law and and and the the regime of international law itself. And we believe it is important to bridge gaps. With regard to differences in first interpretation Differences in interpretation of principles. And the Ways and Means with which to operationalize the application of these principles. And for us this is this concept is not new. There is no conceptual tension. Between upholding the rule of law and developing and developing norms, and this is something that we have practiced, particularly in our region, in the context, for example, of maritime law or of the law of the sea, where conversations to reduce or alleviate the level of ambiguity with regard to the application of principles and norms. Created codes of conduct regarding unplanned encounters or other behaviors in the sea that are not necessarily legally binding, but nonetheless provide the norms that become the building blocks to enrich the law of the sea as as it is applied today. And for us in the context of outer space as a nascent spacefaring nation, we think that such exercise for us is no longer just esoteric, but it's something that is of practical value. Considering our increasing reliance on outer space assets, and indeed such exercise in our view should be, should not be in the words of the office Excellency, the Ambassador of Cambodia on behalf of ASEAN, should not be the exclusive reserve of a small select states, but should instead be inclusive and open-ended. Now having said that, Mr. Chair, please allow me to read the prepared intervention that I have for this topic. Mr. Chair, as mentioned in this morning's panel, space to Earth threats have always been salient in discussions on outer space security, guided by our principled position that outer space does not merely form part of the global Commons, but is in fact a common heritage of mankind. The Philippines aligned with efforts to prevent utilization of space for nuclear warfare. These efforts led to the outright ban on the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space. In addition, the possibility of kinetic descent capabilities has historically informed calls for a legally binding instrument on prohibiting the placement of weapons in outer space, which is a key component of our multilateral conversation to prevent an arms race in outer space. Consistent with the established position of ASEAN in the Non Aligned Movement, we continue to support such calls. Along with ASEAN, we believe that any such legally binding instrument must contain provisions that ensure effective verifiability. As ASEAN stated in its joint statement, the world has witnessed a much change since the dawn of the space age 60 years ago. We have witnessed increasing reliance by the international community, including by developing countries on outer space. Therefore, while we continue to uphold our principled position, we also understand that the conversation and outer space security needs to evolve and transcend the paradigm of strategic stability or the prevention of arms races. In our working Paper #17 with Germany, we identified insufficient understanding of mutual threat perceptions, lack of channels of communications and lack of transparency among others, are sources of current space related security risks. In the spirit of transparency and confidence building, the Philippines wishes to highlight a current Earth to space security risk that is important in our context. Uncoordinated launches of space launch vehicles or rockets into space. And insufficient transparency and coordination with regard to uncontrolled RE entry. Launches an uncontrolled reentry often create a debris that fall on land or sea, features that could pose A considerable threats to ships, aircraft, fishing boats and other vessels that will pass through the drop zones. The Philippines understands, Mr. Chair, that the mandate of the OEWG directly relates to aspects of space security rather than safety. Yet, as experts have repeatedly stressed, safety and security are just two sides of the same coin. If safety hazards result in consequences that bear upon the national security. Of a state as it perceives them, then these hazards become a security concern in the context of space launches and uncontrolled re-entry, communication, coordination and transparency are all crucial to ensuring that threat perceptions are reduced. In our experience, some launching states are more responsible than others. In this regard, the Philippines strongly encourages all delegations to consider subscribing to The Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation. Or HCOC. HCOC subscribing states commit to issuing pre launch notifications, which are an essential good practice and a demonstration of due regard. Still, the HCOC does not provide specific guidelines and procedure to operationalize these pre notification requirements. It might be necessary to commence a conversation with a view to standardizing such operationalization. Further universalization of the Hcoc and elaboration of its provisions will help our joint efforts to develop clear and internationally understood. Standards and norms of behavior with regard to the Conduct of outer space activities. As we have stressed in our working Paper #17 with Germany, the absence of such standards and norms constitutes a security risk. At the same time, the Philippines reiterates its call on all states to uphold the legal obligation of jury guard under Article 9 of Outer Space Treaty. We consider the duty of jury guard as a foundational principle of responsible behavior in outer space. And we encourage this group to continue its conversation to further unpack this principle. We have provided our views on this in our working paper #12. Upholding the duty of due regard entails responsible behavior that takes into account both the interests of other States and also the international community as a whole. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring transparency and exploring means to operationalize the optional provisions of consultations under the Outer Space Treaty. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M822,2,8,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to once again take the floor and provide remarks on Topic 4, Current and future Space to Earth threats by States to space systems. With regard to current threats, as Mr. Stefanovic mentioned this morning, it is important to take note that one of the most destabilizing types of space to Earth weapons has already been addressed, and there is a clear process within the UN to address these types of destabilizing threats. Following general agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1963, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution A Res. 1884, which, quote solemnly calls upon all States A to refrain from placing in orbit and around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons. Then, four years later, in 1967, Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty converted this resolution into part of this legally binding treaty. Specifically, that obligation is quote not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any kind of weapons of mass destruction. Install such weapons on celestial bodies or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner This is a clear and encouraging path to follow. So how should we address space to Earth Threats. Far apart, the United States does not believe that space to Earth threats represent an issue of pressing concern. However, some delegations have raised, both this morning and in the past, the concerns that the United States is planning to develop and deploy space based missile defense interceptors in outer space this mornings Panelists spoke to this issue several times. Doctor Bowen indicated that space based missile events interceptors are quote not a serious issue. Doctor Grego, who has a pH. D in physics and has done significant technical analysis of this issue. Which is available online for all to read, support at this point concluding that space to Earth weapons are quote, impractical, expensive and difficult to defend. Let us discuss this a bit further. 1st As we previously noted, space to Earth weapons have serious technical challenge. As Doctor Grego stated today, from a technical perspective such a system would be inefficient because of large fuel requirements required to launch and return to Earth, difficulties in targeting, the ease of on ground defenses, and the sheer number of satellites, hundreds, possibly thousands, required to defend against a small number, which would make it both costly as well as being deeply vulnerable to interference, damage and destruction. Second, I would point all delegations to the publicly available submissions that our Department of Defense makes regarding its annual budget. These documents, which are a form of US transparency, show that the United States is not spending any money on the research and development of a space based missile defense interceptor capability. This is a clear indication that there is no desire to develop nor deploy such an inefficient, costly system. Doctor Grego also stated that space based missile defense interceptors were not militarily useful and quote a non starter. So where does that leave us? As our presenters mentioned this morning, we should focus on threats that exist now rather than hypothetical concepts. The United States believes that in the international community should focus on making progress on the most pressing counter space threats by focusing on behaviors such as the destructive testing of direct descent anti satellite missiles. Much as we have done in the cyber realm and at Uncopius, we should not be afraid of making incremental progress by adding to the existing norms in space. If the disarmament community can agree on responsible behaviors that can practically and pragmatically reduce existing threats, we should take action to address them now, rather than wait until we find one solution that all parties can agree on. Moreover, we are not saying that our destructive directors and ASAP missile testing commitment is the only step we should take. However, we do believe that a number of countries demonstrating the will to make this commitment is an important first step we can take right now to begin the long accepted UN process of creating meaningful multilateral resolutions that history has shown can move us towards a legally binding mechanism. In that regard, transparency is an important issue that we should all be talking about. There was a discussion this morning about one country's doctrine regarding space. At the same time. One country has established A Strategic Support Force as a war fighting command with a Space Systems Department. That country has tested and operationally deployed a terrestrially launched Direct Descent Anti Satellite Missile missile. One question we have is how can we encourage that country and other countries that have demonstrated they are developing ASAP capabilities to be more transparent about their plans and doctrines, because right now there is a complete lack of transparency. And as our presenters this morning mentioned, that could lead to increasing the risk of misunderstanding that could lead to conflict. As we move towards our last day of discussions, the last, the United States is hopeful that the serious thoughtful discussions and ongoing work collectively in bodies like this open-ended working group will be able to make progress on developing further ideas regarding behaviors to reduce those current threats that raise tensions and cause misperceptions, miscommunications and potential miscalculations leading to conflict. As we look toward the discussions of proposals in January, the United States believes that this body should focus its work on areas that our panelists have identified as urgent and concrete, such as ground to space threats, and not concentrate on theoretical issues like space to ground threats. And as Mr. Stefanovic said this morning, quote, any single soft norm might become a very fruitful achievement. Thank you.",0
S2M99,2,9,United Kingdom,"Thank you very much, Chair, and thank you to the presenters for their interesting presentations. I was just interested in the last point of the last speaker about the flag shopping and whether she would be able to elaborate on that and how significant an issue it currently is? And yeah, just provide a bit more information. Thanks.",2
S2M911,2,9,China,"Thank you, Sir. I thank the panelists for their very interesting presentations. The panelists this morning all mentioned. That. The use of force network methods on the ground. To interfere with the ground facilities that are meant to support space operations. My question in this regard is that. Such an act or such a use is defined to be an act on the space level or it's an act at cyber level. Because application of laws or legal regimes will vary according to definitions. I wish to ask the third presenter or panelist, Madam Alina, to answer this question. Of course, I welcome input from other panelists. Thank you.",2
S2M915,2,9,Cuba,"Thank you very much Chair. I would just like to thank all of the panellists for their presentations, which were very interesting and provided a lot of clarification. I'd like to thank Miss Morozova for her explanations. You spoke about a topic which I think is crucial. You provided us with some very useful examples and I agree with her. That. We know very well that maritime powers. Are the 1st to have measures of a policy where they? Sell. To ships and the main difference between the space arena and the maritime arena is that. Operators have their own area of civilian civil responsibility, but nevertheless. In terms of space, I agree that states are the ones who ultimately bear the responsibility. This is an issue. That we have to provide a solution to, but nevertheless there is a guarantee. The guarantee is that any state that provides an authority. Is responsible for any damage caused ultimately. Which leads me to speak about the question of cyber attacks. There were three states that might be concerned. The state where. The attack has carried out and. The state that causes the attack one perhaps another affected party if, for example, the satellite gets out of control and hits yet another satellite. Once again, there are very clear provisions on this in international law. There is a number of, however of gaps and we need to continue to strengthen space law. So when it comes to this third state, who would they have recourse to? Would they turn? To the first state who is responsible for the cyber attack? In fact. There is an absolute responsibility from states. But there's another responsibility, of course. And I would just hope that the panelists can confirm this to me that we can agree that. The person who launches has to guarantee the security of their spacecraft and so if they lose control of their spacecraft then what happens? Would this mean? That, as I said, all of countries that launch a spacecraft are responsible for the damage that they cause. I think that's a particularly interesting question, and I agree with the speaker that we have to look at these questions in more depth, perhaps not here, but at another body, so that we can establish minimum norms, norms for behaviour in order to ensure that there is control. To guarantee the security of the space domain, I also want to. Ask a question. Turn up the panelists who spoke before Miss Murazova, Mr. Vignetti. He spoke about transparency and making a declaration when a satellite or when an object in space. Is used for military purposes and my question is the following. My delegation has some difficulties in understanding this. It's not an easy question to understand. How can an army operate a space in space for peaceful uses? When? It's used for civilian defense. The question is, how can we guarantee that the declaration that's made by the state with regard to the use of a space asset? How can we ensure that that declaration doesn't involve a violation of the peaceful use of space? My concern will be if we create such a register. This would in fact legitimize the fact that an army declares that it has a space asset. Which in fact in itself violates the principle of the peaceful use of space. We can speak about. Research purposes in space that are both civil and military, but that's quite something. That's something quite else. Something quite different from deciding to make these types of declarations. I'd like to know what the panelists would think of that. How could we ensure that we have a good balance this register? Shouldn't be legitimizing a military use of space? That would be my question. Thank you, Chair.",2
S2M917,2,9,Australia,"Thank you, panelists for your excellent presentations. Speakers highlighted a range of issues, including difficulties associated with attribution, for cyberattacks that are linked to space systems. We are interested in any perspectives or lessons learned, particularly from the parallel cyber, OE, WG and GGE processes that could usefully feed into our discussions on norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour in space. Thank you. I think the distinguished representative of Australia for his question. And now before we go back to the panelists, one last question. The distinguished representative of Austria has the floor. In fact, we have three questions. If this is not too much. The first one concerns the registration convention, which was something Miss Morosova has has explained to us. I mean, clearly this is an instrument which is instrumental for establishing the link between all the commercial actors and and the states. And we also see there is a certain kind of potential of of looking into it, looking into implementation. But we would like to hear from you, what kind of concrete proposals would you have to to to Burke or to build up on the registration convention? Would this be a new instrument, a completely different instrument? Would it be something that would be built up? We will be interested in any ideas you have in that regard. The second question is concerning the presentation by the colleague from the ICRC about the reverberating the indirect effects of attacks, I mean. Given the situation in space, it's very likely that those kind of indirect attacks will happen with any attack that happens in outer space. I mean, also it is very likely that most actors do not know what this indirect effects will be, because there is a lack of knowledge of the satellite and its function itself, there is lack of knowledge about nearby satellites and how they could be affected, also the the the effects by space debris creation and so on. If you take all of this into account, wouldn't that mean that any attack on space objects has problems with implementation of IHL? But I just post this as a very thought provoking question into the into the room and up to you. And 10 as a final point, and I think this has not been touched in the presentations and also this week. How would this also be linked with the law of neutrality? And effects of space assets by neutral states. It's the third question. Thank you.",2
S2M925,2,9,France,"I'd like to thank the panelists for their presentations. Well, I had the same question as Australia. Perhaps to hear what the panelists about the lessons learned and recommendations that they may have related to difficulties presented by the. Attribution of. Satellites or other objects and also there were other questions raised in the room that lead me to the following comment. First, this is indeed a highly timely subject, because indeed the difficulties related to verification and attribution leads to situation that behaviour of States and non state actors. Related to the Earth segment. Are the subject matter of responsible or irresponsible behavior. So this is a subject matter that does not relate only to the regulation of activities of state and non state actors in the cyber Area. This is related to behavior that may have a reversible or reversible impact on space objects. And this concerns all states, because potential collateral damage as a result of a cyber attack on objects on Earth doesn't only concern the state that owns these installations on the ground, but all. Users, regardless of where they are on the face of the planet, and this is indeed a question related to. Security and concerns all of the states that use space and this is how we should look at this subject matter. So this is not simply a legal question, even though I share the views of some speakers said that we're not operating in a legal vacuum. But what is important is that this debate relates to the needs to establish certain norms of behavior need to raise awareness among state and non state actors related to risks. That may arise from irresponsible behavior related to ground based objects, especially in cases of cyber attacks. So I'm making this statement in order to give an additional focus in a discussion that we're having here that. Related to questions of law and liability, but the question is how do we create norms of responsible behavior? And I'm referring to what was said by Mr. Berluti on the. Paris Appeal or the Conference on Bio Security, Security in Cyberspace and. Also, this relates to the question how do we monitor irresponsible behavior, behavior that may lead to mistrust or undermine trust in between? Actors in space. So this is the whole set of issues that we're looking at today. Thank you.",2
S2M927,2,9,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. We've had a bit of a discussion today about the the consequences that attacks on ground infrastructure can have, including. Cyber attacks and in that discussion we've had reference to the concepts of responsibility and liability. So I think it was already touched upon by Miss Morozova in some of her remarks, but I think it's important to recognize the distinction between those two. And the consequences that can have on operators and other countries. So the first point to make was that there is in fact a distinction between those two concepts, and sometimes it can be a little bit blurred because of the wording that's used. But responsibility is 1 distinct area of law, which Miss Morozova has already referred to. But liability is also distinct in of itself. The distinct concept, it's not the same. I wasn't listening to the French translation the other time, but we usually translate it as responsibility to distinguish from responsibility Simplister. And it's important because while the liability convention creates absolute liability. Responsibility. International responsibility is not absolute. And as Miss Morozova pointed out, you have a couple elements. You have to have an internationally wrongful act. And you have to be able to attribute that act to some state actor and we've already discussed this morning that that's very difficult to do particularly in the context of cyber. So those those two should be distinguished. But it's also important to reflect upon the fact that in the liability convention, while damage to aircraft in flight and on damage to property on the surface of the Earth is absolute, damage in space to another space object is not absolute, it's fault based which means that in the event that a ground station is attacked and. Control is lost or malicious commands are sent to crash satellite into another satellite. The claimant would have to demonstrate fault on the part of the launching state and that could be difficult to do in the case of cyber attacks or other attacks on ground stations, partially because the attacker may not have been a launching state and so therefore you may have no one and and the consequence then for third states that have nothing to do with the conflict or states that are behaving perfectly responsibly, is that they could find themselves in a situation where they have. No recourse for compensation for the loss of their space object. And the same holds true in the case where they would attempt to pursue responsibility. Miss Morozova, I think, accurately stated that it's far preferable for a claimant state to seek compensation under the Liability Convention regime because of the rules of that regime. But you could equally try to pursue it through the responsibility aspect, but you would again encounter a lot of difficulties. And so third parties, third states, commercial actors could find themselves without any Ave. for compensation. One for the point with respect to the liability convention that was there is a slight opportunity to exonerate yourself from liability if you're a launching state that was. Not at fault and and that's where you can demonstrate that it was the damage was caused through the gross negligence or omissions with intent to cause damage on the part of the claimant state. So it's a pretty narrow defense, and particularly considering that it's difficult to attribute these acts, but it would mean that. Luckily, a state that engaged in some sort of a malicious attack, which then suffered damage itself, ironically. May not be able to claim damages from a launching state, but I I acknowledge that it's a pretty narrow defense because of the difficulties of attribution. But but what all this brings me to is the fact that. These problems with responsibility and liability. For attacks on ground infrastructure that may cause loss of control or damage. Is that it highlights the importance of defining what is responsible and irresponsible with respect to such attacks because of the very real possibility that the victim will be left with no Ave. of redress. And particularly the innocent third party, the one has nothing to do with the conflict, is not involved in whatever situation has led to the attack, but simply suffers damage through no fault of its own, may find itself with no recourse, at least under space law. And therefore it's very important for all space actors to act responsibly to protect those particularly, you know, developing countries or other countries that only have very few space assets and really can't afford to lose or suffer impairment to their space assets that those who have. The abilities and the capabilities act responsibly in space to protect those that are more vulnerable, and I'll leave it at that. Thank you.",2
S2M929,2,9,Cuba,"Thank you, Chair. I apologize for abusing the use of. The floor. But I believe that we have a little time. It'll be a shame to lose our possibility to discuss with the very good panelists now on these questions related to responsibility and liability. I agree fully with the Delegation of Canada that. The most likely situation that anybody who would like to. Place Some claims will face a reality, but the reality is that there are no possibilities, no avenues for effective redress. I do not believe that responsibility reliability is not absolutely I believe that this responsibility of states in outer space is absolute and here we believe that. Completely norms for. Wrongful act. Is. To the need to show what happened without finding fault, now the rapporteurs, one of the rapporteurs who worked on these questions in the aisle C. On these issues, an Australian was very clear on this issue. In complementary norms, when a primary law international law is violated, there's obligation to ensure redress and there is no need to identify fault. So the issue is not really based on whether these. Responsibility is or not absolutely for us. We believe it is absolute responsibility, but rather we should focus on the effectiveness of redress and the need to strengthen the existing regime. I fully agree with our panelists. I'm a lawyer as well and for me a responsible behaviour is behaviour that is fully in line with the law. But the. For example, for people in the Catholic religions, the those responsible in heterosexual marriage between a woman and a man is responsibility for their children, but also for example.",2
S2M932,2,9,Pakistan,"Thank you very much here and given the positive time, I'll try to be very brief. One of the questions that I have been thinking about for the past few days is when, especially when we say that the existing body of law applies to outer space and particularly when we talk about. The applicability of international humanitarian law. To outer space as this was also highlighted this morning. I think while while it only makes sense that we utilize. The accumulative and collective body flow that we have developed over the years, but I think it could have very serious. Implications for our future? So I channel in particular, for instance, it governs the conduct of hostilities, particularly in an in an armed conflict. So when we say that it applies to outer space, we create a possibility that we create a situation, a possible situation in which there is an armed conflict in in outer space. And I think we should be very very careful about that. Although one argument could be made that IHL in a sense is is neutral. I mean it doesn't look at if if the conflict is justified or not, it simply applies. It applies to state actors, it applies to non state actors. But for example, if today we agree that the placement of weapons in addition to WMD's, the conventional weapons. It is outlawed in in outer space, then international law for outer space made would differ from the international law for Earth. So I mean, I'm not suggesting that we should not apply ISL to to outer space, but I think it will have a very serious complication implication for our future work. So in my opinion, the question is not as much as if we need legally binding rules. Or norms and principles of responsible behavior. But I think even before that, what we need to talk about is if we are ready to outlaw conflict in our space. Thank you.",4
S2M934,2,9,The Islamic Republic of Iran,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank to the distinguished panelists for their presentations. Considering that the state of cyber law is still in its preliminary stages and we do not have a universal cyber law, my main question is how can we define cyber threats? And the use of conventional or unconventional weapons. Against space systems on the ground in the context of a vague and unclear concept of responsible behavior. Thank you.",2
S2M102,2,10,Romania,"Thank you, Chair. It's the first time Romania takes the floor, so allow me to echo delegates and commend your work in steering this open-ended working group. I'm also extending our thanks to all the panelists this week for their very insightful presentations and thought-provoking ideas. Romania subscribes to the EU statement made earlier this week, but I would like just to add some short general remarks in national capacity. Space-based systems have become indispensable for our day-to-day life, and any factor originating in space or on Earth that leads to their disruption can be considered a threat. Whatever the nature of the threat, kinetic or non-kinetic, electromagnetic or cyber, intentional or unintentional, the consequences can be dangerous, long-lasting and far-reaching. Romania has legally recognized space system and services as critical infrastructure more than a decade ago. Together with the increasing essentiality of space systems, our orbital environment has become highly congested. Romania considers managing space traffic as one of the greatest challenges for the sustainability of the space sector. We welcome the voluntary moratorium adopted by the United States on destructive testing of direct-ascent anti-satellite missile systems. This has been followed by other states, which is encouraging and shows that unilateral actions can set an example and start to make a difference. Since 2014, the Romanian Space Agency has been an active member of the EU Space Surveillance and Tracking Support Framework. We contribute with census, validation and data processing to regional activities for the protection of vital assets in space and on the ground. We have to be realistic. Eliminating all space threats is utopian. But we have to be realistic. Romania believes we can reduce them through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour. Our goal is to ensure the safe and responsible conduct of space activities and addressing behaviour should be our first priority. As Dr. Bowen rightfully pointed out yesterday, we already have low-hanging fruit. And to keep with that metaphor, we only need goodwill to prepare a fruit salad tailored for the space environment. Romania encourages all states to act and engage constructively, making full use of this OEWG. It doesn't matter if a state has space capabilities or not. Space belongs to all of us, and there is no reasonable explanation why we can't commit to act responsibly. Finally, Mr. Chair, a striking observation. This was my first time attending a meeting in a UN format. And I find it really odd that, while there is utter disregard of the UN Charter, there is thorough scrutiny for respecting rules of procedure. Thank you.",0
S2M104,2,10,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to once again address the OEWG on this, our final day of the second session. I have asked for the floor today to talk about topic five, current and future Earth to Earth threats by states to space systems. I know it has been a long week, and some may feel that Earth-to-Earth threats are not as exciting a topic as space-to-space or space-to-ground, but I want to assure you that the United States delegation finds Earth-to-Earth threats just as interesting. As we heard from our presenters this morning, Earth-to-Earth threats are terrestrially based and are designed to be used for attacks against the terrestrial infrastructure that supports satellite operations or the user segment. These types of attacks can include malicious cyber activity or physical strikes on ground systems such as command and control systems, data reception stations, or launch infrastructure. Threats to the user segment include spoofing, denial of service, or malware. As we have discussed this week, space systems enable key functions such as global communications, positioning, navigation and timing, scientific observation, exploration, weather monitoring, and multiple vital national security applications. Therefore, it is essential to protect space systems from ground-to-ground attacks, including cyber incidents, in order to prevent disruption to their ability to provide reliable and efficient operations. As our panelists discussed this morning, the terrestrial infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to attack. Space systems are reliant on information systems and networks from design conceptualization through launch and flight operations. Further, the transmission of command and control and mission information between space vehicles and ground networks relies on the use of wireless communications channels. These systems, networks, and channels can be vulnerable to malicious activities that can deny, degrade, or disrupt space operations, or even destroy satellites. Satellite command and data distribution networks could expose space systems, ground infrastructure, users and the links connecting these segments to cyber threats. Malicious cyber activities from ground-based sites directed at satellite command and control links could range from disrupting data or sending unauthorized commands to potentially taking over operational control of a satellite or its payload from its authorized owner and operator. The consequences of such activities could include loss of mission data, decreased lifespan or capability of space systems or constellations, or the loss of positive control of space vehicles, potentially resulting in collisions that can impair systems or generate debris. And as Ms. Morozova stated this morning, these attacks can be difficult to detect, difficult to investigate and attribute, low cost, and easily accessible. She said these attacks can, quote, achieve a malicious goal with relatively little effort without being held accountable. And these ground-to-ground threats are not just theoretical, but one of the most pressing threats. For example, on February 24th of this year, a multifaceted and deliberate cyber attack was carried out against the commercial company Viasat's ground terminal network. The attack resulted in an interruption of Viasat's satellite broadband service. It impacted several thousand customers located in Ukraine and tens of thousands of fixed ground sites across Europe. The purpose of the attack was to interrupt service to Ukrainian government communications. While the attack impacted a majority of the active grounds terminals within Ukraine, a substantial number of additional terminals in other parts of Europe that supported wind turbines and provided internet services to private citizens were knocked offline. Even before this attack, the United States recognized this threat to cyber attacks on ground systems and conducted an extensive review, which resulted in the publication of Space Policy Directive 5, Cybersecurity Principles for Space Systems, which is available online so all can read it. The document lays out the importance of cyber protections for space systems, including principles from the design of a satellite to launch and operation. The purpose of this document is to guide and serve as the foundation for the United States government's approach to the cyber protection of space systems. Cybersecurity principles and practices that apply to terrestrial systems also apply to space systems. However, certain principles and practices are particularly important to space systems. For example, it is critical that cybersecurity measures, including the ability to perform updates and respond to incidents remotely, are integrated into the design of a space vehicle before launch. as most space vehicles in orbit cannot be physically accessed. For this reason, integrating cybersecurity into all phases of development and ensuring full life cycle cybersecurity are critical for space systems and should be critical when developing these systems. Additionally, the United States is concerned about cyber attacks against space systems that compromise the ability of space operators to issue commands and maintain control of on-orbit objects, such as a satellite's telemetry tracking and control system, as this could result in the unrecoverable loss of control of another state's spacecraft and may constitute a hazard to the safety of operations in space. Group to discuss norms of behavior around these cyber threats. Thank you.",0
S2M106,2,10,Norway,"Thank you, Chair. As our colleagues from the United States, Norway is highly interested in earth threats to space systems, despite there being slightly more ordinary, as it were, ordinary sounding than Earth. space to Earth or Earth to space. I will be speaking only to a fragment of Earth to Earth threats to space systems, namely that of jamming of signals from global navigation satellite systems, which is something that Norway has experienced over the last few years a number of times. But as I hope to argue in this statement as well is that even though it is disruption it can have a spillover effect to the space systems or space segments of the space systems themselves. So here we go. The increasing use of global satellite navigation systems has offered great opportunities for increased efficiency in our societies and for the safety of our citizens. This has also resulted in increased dependency on such systems with fewer operational alternatives to satellite navigation. This can pose a risk for the uses of these systems in case of service disruption. Satellite navigation is primarily useful on the ground and in airspace where flight or other activity is conducted. However, there is also an increasing number of satellites that employ GNSS to conduct operations and to assist the satellite operator with determining the satellite's location. With the increasing congestion of outer space, particularly in lower Earth orbit, it is more important than ever to know the precise location of satellites. Increased congestion increases the risk for satellites to collide or operate in proximity so close that they may disrupt or damage each other. Jamming OGNSS signals even on the ground has the potential also to affect satellite operations in space. States may have legitimate reasons to conduct tests and experiments that disrupt GNSS signals, for instance in order to better understand how terrestrial systems may be affected and to consider how the risk of disruption can be managed. However, GNSS receivers on spacecraft are generally highly sensitive. This renders them vulnerable to disruption in the case of intended or unintended exposure to such signals from the ground. In particular, satellites in low Earth orbit are at risk of disruption from exposure. exposure to such signals from the ground because of their relative proximity to the Earth's surface. Many of these satellites orbit the Earth in a polar orbit. If the source of these signals, jamming signals, is located at a sufficiently high latitude, such satellites could be exposed to jamming signals in nearly all their orbital passes. It would conform to a normal responsible behaviour to limit the use of such jamming and to take the potential disruption of satellite operations into account before performing an otherwise legitimate operation, especially at high latitudes. The intended disruption of a space system in the user segment may therefore also disrupt other space systems in the space segment. Jamming may inadvertently complicate satellite operations, but it could even result in loss of communications with or control of a satellite so as to preclude reliable maneuvering. It is expected that more and more satellites will be equipped with collision and close proximity avoidance systems that will allow them to avoid situations in which two or more satellites or other space objects pass dangerously close to each other. The optimal functioning of such systems requires that the precise location and velocity of the satellite is always known. Disruption of GNSS signals could result in imprecise location and velocity data that would increase the risk of damage to, or even destruction of, valuable space assets. Therefore, it would conform to a normal responsible behaviour that tests that include jamming of GNSS signals be conducted only if they are strictly necessary for a legitimate purpose at hand. If a test is necessary, then the state that conducts that test must strive to use the lowest possible transmitter power in order to avoid the unintended jamming of other users that rely on these signals, both on Earth as well as in space. Additionally, it is important that any such activity is properly notified in ample time before a test is conducted. Now, I've said a number of things about conforming to a normal responsible behavior, and I don't by that mean to say that for any threat that we may discuss in this room now that there should be a norm corresponding to precisely that sort of activity. I think to look a bit forward, I think it would be important for our future discussion on norms, rules and principles to try to find norms, rules and principles that can sort of encompass more than just... managing one or two or each individual threat that we discuss, but to find more general norms that are able to cover all of the threats that we discuss. It's not that it's all about certain signals that can jam satellites, but it's about finding norms that govern the behavior that leads to the use of such systems. Thank you, Chair.",0
S2M108,2,10,Russia,"Thank you. Thank you, Chair. With regard to topic five, which we are currently discussing. Well, we are getting a rather interesting impression with regard to this discussion. to a great extent as we have seen. Everything is either reduced to issues to do with cybersecurity, informational security. or if you look at the interventions from the panellists, issues to do with the application of international humanitarian law. with regard to cyber security. In our view. We are once again at this forum, at this meeting of the OEWG, trying to discuss issues. which on the one hand... and not really related to space law issues. and on the other hand, issues that are discussed at other relevant forums, international forums, including those which have been established by the UN's General Assembly. And once again, we are observing that in this, there is an attempt to overlap the already existing international efforts. that are being undertaken by the international community. So therefore, so that we don't undermine the discussions and debate and the efforts that the UN's member states are taking in discussing issues related to cyber security at the relevant forum, it seems to us that we have to do something about this. that it would rather be better to allow them to continue that work. Perhaps they could pay attention to issues that are related to ensuring cyber security for space objects and terrestrial infrastructure that's related. But with regard to this OEWG, we don't see any need to discuss these topics here. in our view, it will be better to focus our attention. on those problems which are not being discussed at other relevant international fora. and which are only to be discussed here. And at the outset, that is issues related to preventing an arms race in space, as well as issues which are directly stemming from measures and actions to militarize space and to weaponize space. with regard to issues to do with international humanitarian law. We have taken note of the fact that IHL. is applicable to any space, any domain in which there is an armed conflict, including beyond national jurisdictions. And nevertheless, we believe that discussing the applicability of international humanitarian law as part of the mandate of this group is something that would automatically mean that we are allowing for the possibility of an armed conflict even arising in space. And using this as a launch pad, a starting point, in fact, is creating a political paradigm, rather a legal paradigm for states, which in fact runs counter to the main foundations on issues to do with the mastery of space, including the guidelines of the international community on the fact that it spaces only to be used for peaceful purposes. International humanitarian law is a number of treaty and legal norms which regulate the means and methods by which war is to be conducted and which is aimed at ensuring that victims are protected during an armed conflict. So given this, speaking about the applicability of international humanitarian law is the only correct in areas where there are indeed armed conflicts going on. Humanity has a joint interest in progress and studying and using space for peaceful purposes and a desire to ensure that there's broad international cooperation both for scientific and for legal aspects of the study and use of space for peace purposes. And all of that is enshrined in the preamble of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. And in line with its Article 4, states parties are obliged not to put into low Earth orbit any objects which are related to nuclear weapons or any other forms of weapons of mass destruction. and not to place such weapons on celestial bodies or place any such weapon in outer space in any way. The moon and other celestial bodies are only to be used for peaceful purposes. The creation of military bases on celestial bodies or strengthening or testing any forms of weapons or carrying out military maneuvers is prohibited. At the same time, this article allows military personnel to be sent there for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes. You can also use any equipment or means which are required for the peaceful study of the moon or any other celestial bodies. And so in this way, space has a regime of partial demilitarization. The prohibition is about placing weapons of mass destruction. And at the same time, the moon and celestial bodies are fully demilitarized. There is a full prohibition on placing weapons in space. In fact, this is lacking from international law. There is no such prohibition. Some states are abusing these nuances in order to justify the possibility of an armed conflict arising in space. And this means therefore that the norms of international humanitarian law will be applicable. That is the right to war. You said Bello. States have an interest in studying and using space in peaceful purposes. And this is stipulated in a number of fundamental international agreements on space law. In particular, in the Convention on Liability for Damaged Caused by Space Objects of 1972, as well as the Registration Convention for Objects Launched into Outer Space of 1974, as well as the Agreement on States Activities on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which is from 1979, as well as Russia's Initiative of the Annual GA Resolution on weapons not being placed first in space. In the resolution, the special importance of a strict compliance with the existing legal regime is stressed. This regime allows for space to be used for peaceful purposes. It is recognized that the legal regime in itself does not guarantee the prevention of an arms race in space. And therefore, this needs to be strengthened. there is an urgent call on states with regard to those who have space potential that they look at the possibility of expressing their commitment to a political obligation to not place weapons first in space. More than 130 states vote for that resolution. with regard to not placing weapons first in space. More than 20 states, including Russia, have made a declaration in that regard. And... All member states of this CSTO also undertook such an obligation. A commitment to not place weapons first in space has also been affirmed in by the CSTO's members who were members of the UN. And there was support for a multilateral initiative of not placing weapons first in space. in 2019. It's clear that such a broad participation for the idea of not placing weapons first in space to prevent an arms race and also to preclude this severe threat to international peace and security cannot be held at the same time as a discussion about the applicability of international humanitarian law to space because this has some understanding at the basis of it that there could be an armed conflict in space. Those who advocate for IHL being applied to space believe that at some point in the future, in one way or another, space and military technologies will become accessible for a broad range of counter agents. And that engaging them in space... might have severe humanitarian consequences for millions of people on the Earth, as well as for the normal functioning of important infrastructure systems. However, we already witnesses to the fact that civil space objects are being used to achieve certain military objectives on the ground. A number of states are actively promoting the view that given that military activities in space are not regulated by international law, that that opens up a possibility that it might be used for military purposes at some point in the future. And if that's the case, then in fact, now... IHL is already required in order to alleviate the repercussions of any potential military armed conflict in space. We believe that this is a destructive point. international humanitarian law being used to regulate space, in fact, opens up a Pandora's box. And it gives a false signal to the international community about a war in space as being a potential thing that could occur. at the same time when the whole of the international legal arsenal in this regard and the efforts of the international community, including Russia and its partners, are in fact aimed against this, at preventing any war occurring in space. And that is why the Russian Federation believes that in principle, no armed conflict is possible in space. and it's also a serious existential threat to humanity. We would call on the UN's member states to focus their efforts not on ephemeral humanitarian measures to prevent the repercussions of hypothetical war in space, but rather to fully attempt to strengthen the space law regime, including with regard to not placing weapons in space. the use of force or the threat of force against space objects or with their use or using them in order to achieve the goal of preventing an arms race in space. In conclusion, I... I would like to just return back to what we heard from the panelists in their presentations this morning. And we would just like to draw everyone's attention to the recommendations and proposals from Ms. Morozova. That was with regard to a review and amendments being made to Article 6 of the Outer Space Treaty. We believe that... Such recommendations are destructive in a context of international space law. And such proposals are linked first and foremost to the fact that at, within international space law, we are trying to launch topics that are not directly related to this specific area of international law. That is the topic of cyber security. with regard to space infrastructure, which is in terrestrial systems. Therefore, in order to maintain international space law as a guarantor, of the use and exploration of space for peaceful purposes. We believe it to be necessary to discuss, to consider and to work. with regard to Earth infrastructure, which is related to space activities within those areas of international law. which are related in particular. Cybersecurity, we believe, should be only considered at those four which consider issues to do with international informational security and global cybersecurity. We do have such four that are already in place. And here... at the OEWG. Let's just focus on issues that are to do with international space law. Thank you.",4
S2M1010,2,10,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, the discussion on this topic is on the attack and threat against land-based infrastructure connected with space systems. And China has the following questions. First. Military actions on land are already under a comprehensive set of international legal rules. And why is it necessary to discuss only the threats to the land-based infrastructure connected with space systems? Secondly... How should one define and distinguish the infrastructures connected with space systems such as power stations, data receiving centers and communication-based stations? If the power station supplies to civilians while supporting the launch of satellites, is it part of the infrastructure for the space systems? Third... The working group on the long-term sustainability of outer space activities of Unispace discussed the mitigation of the risks to the land-based infrastructure. and what is the relationship between the discussion at the OZWG and that on this topic and that at the Unispace. Fourthly when land attack is used to support land infrastructure. the... Is it part of the cyber action or actions or behavior in outer space? Fifthly, non-state entities while engaging in such cyber attacks should follow which international law? to define attribution. Is it the International Space Law or the Law of State Responsibility? before consensus is reached among states on these issues? And is it responsible or irresponsible to rush to conclude such norms? Is it responsible or irresponsible to... take conclusions on the cyber actions. This is obviously not reasonable and also irresponsible. Legally speaking... It is not necessary for the working group to discuss land-to-land threats, and the discussion in fact could affect the discussions in other forums and the existing international legal regime. China is therefore of the view, does suggest to the OEWG, not to draft norms for responsible behaviour in outer space in terms of land to land threats. Mr Chairman. I would wish to take this opportunity to respond to the statement by our US colleague yesterday. China follows a defensive policy of defense and has actively engaged in the peaceful use of the outer space and engaged in the international space cooperation. As for the technical tests mentioned by the US yesterday, China... The Chinese government has disclosed timely, in a transparent and responsible manner, the information relevant. As for the dual-use space technologies, China stands for preventing any country from using dual-use technologies to develop military capabilities for outer space in a legally binding manner, while ensuring developing countries can use the relevant technologies peacefully. the international community has every reason to be concerned with the development body of space technologies and capacity with potential military use. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",0
S2M1012,2,10,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our current team's purpose and responsibility is to discuss. the rules and regulations of the act. The director said, I must stop you. Not the execution of the sentence, but Yes, the Chinese interpretation seems to be coming in through the ink. Mr Chairman, the channel has already been changed. It's already been fixed. I do apologize. I apologize for this inconvenience. It's no problem. That would have been interesting to hear. Perhaps start again, maybe move a little bit through the first part. So I was speaking about the objective of the working group here to develop norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors in order to reduce space threats. And we heard from our panelists this morning that Earth to Earth threats targeting the ground segment. are very real threats. We've also heard before that space systems are integrated. They require a space segment, ground segment, and the links between them. Therefore, I think it is well within the group's mandate to discuss all these threats and look at responsible behaviors to reduce these threats in order to improve space security generally. I don't think there's any need to reduce or exclude any particular behaviors that could increase the security of the space systems and reduce threats for everyone. But related to the mandate here, there seems to be maybe a little bit of confusion about why it is that we're talking about responsible behaviors. And so perhaps we can take a step back and reflect on some of the comments that have been made by delegations this afternoon, one of which referenced... the Outer Space Treaty at the Preamble in particular and some of its articles. And so I think it's important to reflect on the great contribution that the Outer Space Treaty has made, but also places where our efforts here can supplement that treaty in order to improve space security by reducing threats. And that's really the goal here. So the Preamble of the Outer Space Treaty does tell us that we recognize the common of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. So that is a statement about what we recognize, that what's in our best interests. And it's an objective, the idea that we should try to engage in outer space activities that are peaceful because that's in our common interest. However, in the actual provisions, the operative paragraphs of the Outer Space Treaty, we don't see a similar language. So in the rights and obligations that are set out, it's not there. True, in Article 4, we have a specific provision about the exclusively peaceful uses of the moon and other celestial bodies. But between those two, we don't have a general one for outer space. We do have principles that guide us. However, those rights and obligations in the Outer Space Treaty are general in nature. and they need a little bit of supplementing to help us. So we've had a lot of discussions today about what's lawful and what's unlawful, but I hope that many of the delegations here understand that... Behavior that is unlawful is already prohibited, that is correct, but there's a whole range of behaviors that while they are lawful, meaning they're not strictly prohibited by the outer space treaty or any of the others, can still be undesirable because they could give rise to actual threats or perceptions of threats. And the way that we can attempt to reduce those threats is through discussions of things like norms and principles of responsible behavior that foster confidence and reduce the threats or perceptions of threats. And that's what we're attempting to do here. So the fact that law already exists doesn't end the work. There's still additional work we can do. And Ms. Morozova in her presentation today alluded to that in response to one of the questions. the Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention that can be supplemented or assisted through the development of soft laws such as the several UN General Assembly principles that we've had, direct television broadcasting, nuclear power source principles, practices on registrations. These things, while non-binding, are helpful in interpreting the law and in guiding the conduct of states so that we can have a peaceful use of outer space, notwithstanding the fact the provisions and a complete code in the outer space treaties for every particular issue. So I hope that helps clarify for some delegations that while there is law, we still need to supplement it with things like responsible behaviors and identifying irresponsible behaviors to ensure that we get towards that call in the outer space treaty to recognize the common interests of all humanity in the progress of the use and exploration of outer space for peaceful purposes. good faith to do that, recognizing already which international law applies where, and I'm pleased that all delegations now do recognize that the UN Charter, international law, including international humanitarian law, apply in space as they do on earth. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M1014,2,10,Cuba,"Well, this is a very interesting debate that we're having here. Really that there's a whole number of points that we... agree on and something that we can understand but others are not easy to understand. Now the whole set of issues related to the application of IHL is somewhat like a trap because the IHL doesn't really state where it applies what jurisdiction it covers. It is clear that it should be a situation of conflict but there is a prohibition that exists and that is there can be no armed conflict in space. So now to say Aichel applies to space, that this Cuban civil law applies as well. Because when we study law, we look at public law is an umbrella that covers or rather space law is a little umbrella that is carried around so any astronaut is covered by national law as a private national of that country. So I think that it is really not necessary to discuss whether IHL applies in space or not because we say that there should be no conflict. in law and law prohibits conflict in law. So I think we should focus our attention on the need to prevent such conflicts in space. And this is why we have the whole idea of Paris. So for my delegation, it's a bit confusing to understand. what we're discussing here, and we understand the concerns of the Russian delegation, because we seem to be sending the wrong signal that this group will be regulating war in space. And as our distinguished colleague from Canada said, this gap that exists, something in between, is so ambiguous that indeed conflict can be regulated in space because space can be an arena for warfare. So I believe that without any doubt the existence of legal norms does not mean that our work will end. And here I agree with the distinguished delegation of Canada but nevertheless when I... do not fully understand the analysis is when mention is made that there is a general framework but that doesn't really apply in general. I think it should be the other way around. The Constitution has a general perspective and then there are specific norms that regulate separate issues. So we can say that we... have a constitution for outer space. It is general, and it covers the issues, at least in my understanding. So I believe that there's a whole set of different acts that may require the. development or to ensure scientific and technological development, something that at some point we didn't really know where we'll find ourselves today in terms of science development. So there is without doubt the need to complement the norms that already exist. And we see that some delegations, important delegations, do not wish to negotiate such new norms. really find it difficult to understand. So how, one question, how will you regulate the feeling that there is a threat? There are some legal norms that regulate situations where one person will not be threatened by what another person can do. There are rules threatening or a danger and it's regulated but there are no norms that regulate a situation to ensure that a person is not concerned with a potential threat. So I believe that there are certain actions that should be regulated because my delegation has always... was amazed that a delegation can say that arms can be placed in space. because this will be a direct violation of international law. But some delegations say no. And there's that gray zone. And the peaceful use doesn't mean that weapons are prohibited. And we are facing a contradiction, a dichotomy. And this is where our group may be involved. If peaceful use includes... military uses, for example, placement of weapons in outer space. So we have conducts where an armed weapon is in space and something that should be regulated. But if, but for Cuba it is clear that should be prohibited. But some people do not agree. And we need then to do something to ensure that people or countries do not feel threatened. But it is difficult to see how we will continue our work moving away from the legal dynamics and focusing on the political dimension when someone feels being threatened. And the last point that my delegation finds important, that at some point our group should think about the scope of what we're doing here. thing which called Kramchaina gave us an example of electrical infrastructure that provides support of the land infrastructure that controls space objects. And this is an important question because if we continue thinking along in a linear way, this will mean that the group has to work on codes of conduct of military people and civilians that work with any things related to space. in order to be responsible in their work and not lead to certain incompatibility with laws. So I think that at some point we should impose a limit in Spanish. And I think that we have to be very careful. with what we wish to cover in our work. Because if we're talking about scenarios involving land infrastructure, then we have to look at what existing laws can do. And I'm not sure whether our group can actually deal with that. So in other words, we have to be more focused in our work. I know our mandate that has a sentence and many didn't like it, it relates to threatens. And if we look at space, a threat can be anything. Now, there could be an individual working for a private company, and that work can be covered by this, or this can go all the way to statements being made by politicians. And we have to cover all these situations. But. our group should focus on threats that exist in space and determine whether there are any gray areas in space law that can be complemented with other binding norms. If we really wish to talk about responsible behavior. Thank you.",4
S2M1016,2,10,Germany,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. We would like to make three quick points to this interactive and lively debate. First, we'd like to mention that the Viasat attack on a satellite communications provider was in our view a very significant event, and one which of course first and foremost affected users of satellite communications in Ukraine. But at the same time, just to share this with colleagues, Germany was also affected by this attack and connectivity to a number of wind turbines in the North Sea was lost. And we believe this illustrates that, in a way, these kinds of cyber attacks on the ground infrastructure of satellite communications can lead to effects in critical sectors for the resilience of a country. But in this case, the effects were not so severe that energy supply in Germany was severely disrupted. effects. The second point I'd like to make is on the interplay between the Earth-to-Earth threats and threats in the cyber domain. And we took note of the opinion voiced by a couple of delegations that it would be beneficial not to, in a way, encroach upon the work strands in the cyber field. Nevertheless, we don't see it as a sort of competition between different processes here, as the challenges to ensure consistency and in a way maybe even benefit from the expertise the cyber colleagues already have in their field. So what we would say is that the cyber field has explored the concept of critical infrastructure and we heard in one of the presentations of this week that in the cyber field, generally into critical infrastructures by cyber means. And we would say this should guide us also to ensure that we come up with a consistent and complementary responsible behavior for a wider set of interference measures into space systems. So I would like to draw your attention to our national contribution from 2021, where we suggest a number of principles of responsible behavior, and where conduct or knowingly support cyber or electromagnetic interferences, impairing the provision of critical space-based services to the public. And when we worked on this concept, we actually were inspired by the work of our cyber colleagues and believe that such an approach by just looking at what is already there in the cyber field and broadening these principles to interference in general, be it by cyber means, or by electromagnetic means in general can be a way forward to ensure that we are both consistent with the cyber domain but also that we address the wider range of threats. And lastly, I would like to comment on the question of the military use of space and the peaceful use of outer space. is important here is really to avoid the perception that just by talking about conflict in space, we are making it more likely. We believe that there's already significant international law that in a way regulates conflict. There's the provision in the UN Charter which bans the threat or use of force. But nevertheless, there's a reason for existence for international humanitarian law covering the field how hostilities are conducted. shows that although we want to avoid conflict at high cost, there's still a merit in discussing either the legal regime governing the conduct of hostilities or, and that is in our view the focus of this group, to discuss what measures are there that can make conflict less likely. And this we believe is something where responsible behavior can have a benefit and that is why we believe we should explore this. in more detail. We believe that an idea that was mentioned in this debate previously, that banning the military use of dual-use object is an idea that is not adequate to the state in a way these dual use technologies such as active debris removal or other technologies like rendezvous and proximity operations, they offer tremendous benefits for civil application and the sustainability of outer space and therefore we believe the best approach is first to identify in a way the drivers of risk and then try to conceive transparency production measures on first on a voluntary basis that help to mitigate these and in a way make sure that we are as far as possible from the behaviors that then have a high risk of misperception, miscalculation and which could then lead into conflict. Thank you Mr. Chair.",0
S2M1018,2,10,Netherlands,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to make a brief intervention in this debate on the applicability of international law. We're not here to regulate war in space. We are identifying threats in space and encouraging responsible behavior. And war has already been regulated on Earth as in space. And that corpus of law, both the just at Bellum and the just in Bello, is applicable. It's not our task to repeat that exercise, we think. With our Canadian colleagues, we also believe that in accordance with the law of outer space, we must acknowledge that international law applies space and that those rules may not prevent breaches but can ensure accountability. Article 3 of the outer space treaty clearly says so. And in addition, as well said by my German colleague just now, we also don't think it's a matter of competition but of complementarity. We think it's misleading to say that war in space will only occur when IHL applies in outer space. Law is not about regulating that which should occur and hope that by not regulating something it will not happen. That would be an illusion. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M1020,2,10,Cuba,"thank you, Chair. I simply, in an interactive manner... share with you the following. Now really, does one think that is it possible to comply with the principle of distinction in outer space if we base ourselves on IHL? The principle of distinction that through which you can determine whether target is legitimate or not in a conflict. But the problem is that when you look at outer space and you will apply the principle of distinction, you have to make a distinction between everything that is up there is for peaceful uses only. So you can apply the principle of distinction under IHL and you look at outer space and you determine that there is an object that can be a military target. You're not really applying the placeable of distinction under IHL. And you are actually deciding that there's a violation of international law. So there are certain things that are causing concern for my delegation, especially from a legal point of view and the legal message that we're sending. And the same applies to the question of proportionality. Proportionality means that you'll respond to a threat in a proportionate manner, proportionate to the threat that you're perceiving or the attack that is occurring. And if that happens from outer space because there's violation of international law. Indeed, when an incident, a land space incident occurs and a satellite is destroyed, the questions will not be related to IHL, whether there was a correct distinction was made in identifying the satellite, whether it's proportional action in terms of destroying a satellite, and then to see whether this was compatible with IHL. And if not, then the debate will move to countermeasures that regulate customer norms of international law and the right for defense of a state that requires provostalization. But here, proportionality is viewed not as part of IHL, but as part of the exercise of the right to legitimate defense. So these are legal elements in mind. I agree that yes cyber security can without doubt be an element that threatens the activities in outer space and also so is brain drain when a developed country is stealing the brains from a developing country then this is something similar and we have other examples that may be considered as a threat related to activities in outer space. For example, limits to transfers of technologies when patents are being protected and the economic benefits. And if you limit transfer of technologies, maybe you, in a direct manner, you're also implementing or posing a threat through outer space. because space launch can happen without necessary technological support as a result of these limits on transfer of technologies. And as a result, there will be an accident or a threat in outer space. So what I'm saying is that we are concerned with the fact where we wish to actually make a stop. If we would. wish to complement existing norms. Cuba supports that and we think that the best way to do that is to do it on the basis of a legally binding instrument that guarantees responsible behavior by all actors. Now, this morning we talked about private actors and I'm not sure whether we'll be talking about this in the work of this group. Well, we're concerned with that point from several points of view. First, because this is an activity that is really speeding up. Second, if we talk about any potential accidents in outer space, at some point we'll have to look at the activities of private actors, and that will lead to accidents and also lead to debris. So I believe that when we... talk about whether cybersecurity will be of interest to this group. I believe that will be much more interesting to talk about whether responsible behavior. And here, we not only focus on states, but we also focus on private actors, something that could be interesting, but it's up to the experts in the group to decide. Thank you.",4
S2M1022,2,10,New Zealand,"Mr Chair, let me once again express our thanks to you and to the Secretariat for pulling together the meeting this week. Thanks also to our interpreters. I recognise we've got limited time this afternoon so I'll keep my comments brief. Mr Chair, this week has provided us the opportunity to identify space threats. There have been several key themes that have arisen that are worth highlighting. First, space threats. the threat from the testing of destructive direct-descent anti-satellite missiles. It appears from our observations that there is a broad agreement that this testing, the resultant debris and the potential for misunderstandings creates an environment for the perception of threat. New Zealand renews our call for all countries to commit to not engaging in this testing. There has been some discussion this week about how this is unfair and creates a situation that has been framed as creating the haves and the have-nots. I'd like to note that this argument has come from, primarily from a country that has tested this capability. I would say to all countries that if we were to accept this framing, New Zealand is in the camp of the have-nots. Yet here we are, calling for a stop to this behaviour. We do so as it is very clear that our interests are best served by ensuring the safety and security of outer space assets. Destructive direct descent ASAT testing creates an unacceptable risk. We call on all countries to make this commitment. Second, in the absence of sufficient transparency and agreement of established practice, rendezvous or proximity operations are a feature of space activity that pose particular risk to the safe and sustainable use of space. Proximity or rendezvous operations that manifest as hostile maneuvering may increase the likelihood of miscalculation or misunderstanding. They could prompt... threatening responses, whether terrestrial or in outer space, and have unforeseen and unintended third-order consequences for other space objects and civilian infrastructure. On the other hand, activities such as active debris removal and on-orbit servicing, which require RPO manoeuvres, are carried out for legitimate and desirable purposes. Likewise, we heard this week some very informative presentations about the benefits and the use of lasers for range finding to improve space situational awareness. There appears to be little argument in this room that improving such awareness would be a benefit to us all from both a space safety and a space security perspective. However, that self-same technology has the potential to cause damage, reversible or irreversible. These examples highlight the very purpose of this forum. An environment where the same physical capability can be interpreted and misinterpreted, norms of behaviour need to be agreed to guide such activity. Mr Chair, once again we thank you, the Secretariat, and all the speakers this week for guiding a constructive discussion. We look forward to the next session in January. Thank you.",0
S2M1024,2,10,United Kingdom,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and let me pick up where the distinguished representative of New Zealand left off by thanking you very warmly for the skillful and patient way in which you've steered our work this week. As this second session ends, it is right that we step back and reflect on what we have learned so far and consider how this can help us make progress towards fulfilling the mandate of our open-ended working group. The United Kingdom takes a good deal of encouragement from our discussions these last five days. We welcome the open, thoughtful, and constructive way in which so many delegations have engaged. This conversation between states on what they each find threatening in the activities, actions, and omissions of other states is, in and of itself, an important transparency and confidence building measure. We have heard that there are inevitably differing threat perceptions. What one state might consider a security building activity may raise suspicion or the prospect of a threat in the eyes of another state. As our distinguished Canadian colleague reminded us, this subjectivity is precisely what this work is designed to overcome. By agreeing on what constitutes normal responsible behavior, we can bring objectivity and a common basis on which to address security concerns. The first step is to understand what each of us finds threatening. We have learned much this week about the wide range of concerns that states have regarding threats to space systems. Kinetic and non-kinetic threats. Threats to all segments of space systems. Capabilities that could be misused or misunderstood if used in a certain way. Behaviors that should be considered irresponsible. Activities that could be misinterpreted. Space policies, strategies, and doctrines that are opaque or deemed by some to be provocative. This dialogue and the enhanced understanding that it allows will stand us in good stead for the important discussions ahead of us. Mr Chair, our discussions to date in this open-ended working group have confirmed the importance of the current legal and normative framework, and that additional measures are required to address the challenges of rapid technological change and increasingly intense competition between states. As we said in our opening statement this week, it is this reality and the complexity of the security environment that we must take as our starting point. States are contesting space to gain advantage, and states are seeking to counter the advantages that space affords to their competitors. As is widely recognised, legally binding instruments are not the only measure at our disposal to ensure that competition between states does not inadvertently spill over into conflict. Voluntary norms of behavior, combined with enhanced mutual understanding, dialogue and transparency and strengthened space situational awareness, can help to reduce risks of misunderstanding and unintended escalation. We also take encouragement from the fact that we seem to be finally moving beyond the binary debates between legally binding and non-legally binding measures that have hampered progress under PAROS for too many years. There is increasing recognition that agreements on behavioral norms can be valuable steps towards the eventual negotiation of legally binding instruments. As our distinguished colleague from the Philippines said, there is no contradiction between the rule of law and the development of voluntary norms. Indeed, the history of arms control shows that many arms control agreements have enshrined norms previously adopted in resolutions and other so-called soft law instruments. Mr Chair, as many delegations have noted, it is essential that this process remains inclusive and takes account of the interests of all States. The United Kingdom fully agrees, and that is the very purpose of our open-ended working group operating by consensus. We have heard that many States want to avoid a selective approach to new norms. The United Kingdom agrees with this, too, and encourages all delegations to suggest measures that would help ensure a balanced approach across the work of our group. That said, if we are to make progress and truly unblock the deadlock of recent years, it is important that we proceed step by step. We must take action where we can to address the most pressing threats. In doing so, we can put in place building blocks that provide proof of concept and a solid foundation for future measures. To conclude, Mr. Chair, this week has provided us with a great deal of food for thought. We all now have an intensive period of work ahead of us in which to develop concrete proposals. We look forward to seeing you and everyone here again in January and continuing these vital discussions. Thank you once again.",1
S2M1026,2,10,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. My delegation congratulates you for your successful steering of the second session of the open-ended working group. We thank the Secretariat for the excellent arrangements and the panelists who generously lent their expertise. We had anticipated this session to be challenging, given that there are sensitivities that are difficult to avoid when characterizing irresponsible behavior. Yet the manner with which you structured our work has created an enabling environment that allowed our delegations to engage constructively. We therefore commend your professionalism and excellent leadership. In today's session, we reached, in this week's session, we reached a measure of understanding of how various states perceive current and future, Earth to space, space to space, space to Earth, and Earth to Earth threats to space systems. This is a valuable first step towards addressing the insufficiency of our understandings of mutual threat perceptions, and therefore, already constitutes an invaluable transparency and confidence building measure. I'm afraid the Ambassador, the Distinguished Ambassador of the United Kingdom beat me to saying that. We wish to take this opportunity to highlight the points that we derive from our discussions this week. First, our constructive discussions validates our aspiration for a legally binding and multilaterally verifiable instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, including the prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space and the prohibition on the threat or use of force against outer space objects. Second, at the same time, the diffusion of space-based technologies and their use in modern societies has made it necessary to start addressing security risk and threats in outer space. Our conversation on outer space security therefore needs to evolve and transcend the traditional strategic paradigms. Our work to clarify our varying threat perceptions and reach a common understanding of what could constitute irresponsible or threatening behavior is therefore already crucial. Third, as ASEAN stated, any initiatives in the context of outer space security should also take into account the inherent right to peaceful uses of space technologies. They should therefore not hamper innovation. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that risks and threats do not necessarily arise from capabilities, which are in themselves value neutral. Indeed, some of these capabilities could advance efforts to promote the long-term sustainability of space. the important consideration when examining the drivers of risk and threats is behavior. Four, while there remains a measure of subjectivity with regard to perceptions of behavior, such subjectivity can be alleviated through transparency, communications, and consultations. These are already encouraged by international space law, but they need supplemental elaboration and operationalization. Five, and finally, there is a clear overlap between our work here and the work stream related to cybersecurity, and there are areas where we can take inspiration from some of Similarly, some of the aspects of our work here pertains to issues of safety, which falls within the remit of COPWAS. It is therefore important that our work is informed by what is happening in COPWAS and vice versa. As our discussions this week indicate, safety and security are two sides of the same coin. If safety hazards result in consequences that bear upon national security interests of a state as it perceives them, then these hazards become a security concern. these considerations prepare us for the next session where we will have an opportunity to clarify what constitutes responsible behavior in space. The Philippines reiterates that the duty of jury guard, which is a legal obligation required by the Outer Space Treaty, but whose development precedes the said treaty, is the foundational principle that will guide our consideration of what constitutes responsible behavior in space. We hope that we can continue our conversation to further unpack this principle. Mr. Chair, we see our work to fulfill the mandate of the OEWG as a necessary journey towards future-proofing our rules-based international order. There is much at stake, and we must make sure that this journey does not go off tracks. We are confident with you as our driver, and we fully support your vision of how our conversation should be structured as we progress in our work. We look forward to an inclusive conversation that takes into account all perspectives, including and especially those from developing countries and nascent spacefaring countries. We encourage delegations to transcend differences in political outlooks and bridge differences in understandings by asking the right questions and addressing such questions with open minds. We must sharpen our convergences and demonstrate that multilateralism works. You can count on the Philippines to continue engaging constructively in this regard. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M1028,2,10,Australia,"Thank you Chair. My delegation wishes to thank you and the Secretary for organising a rich and comprehensive agenda and range of expert panellists this week. I would also like to thank the interpreters for their outstanding service. Australia acknowledges the importance of inclusivity and diversity in these space security discussions and was pleased to host a site event in this regard. Chair, I'd like to offer some observations from the week as we look forward to the third session of Behaviours in January. This week we have discussed from where threats can emanate, earth to space, space to space, space to earth and earth to earth. In all of this, capabilities continue to evolve. We've had an engaging discussion from the murder mystery of the icicle as a murder weapon. This illustrated the conundrum of dual use and the challenges around definitions. This is why we maintain that we should adopt a capability neutral approach. Just as we would not wish to restrict states from possessing icicles, as we heard from our panelists, there are many peaceful and beneficial capabilities that could otherwise be inadvertently constrained. Australia articulated a framework that contained the potential elements of what may constitute a threat or hazard in outer space. We proposed that a threat may include the following elements, behaviour, by an actor, with intent, causing or having the potential to cause detriment to persons or things. On the other hand, we view a hazard as lacking an actor or intent. may also be relevant factors. Of these elements, intent is key to differentiating between the use of space capabilities in a peaceful manner or a threatening manner. As we have heard from panellists and states, intent is difficult to ascertain. Transparency and confidence-building measures can help in this regard and should be considered as a key element of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour. Chair, we heard some states views that issues such as debris should be discussed in other fora. However, we consider that if large amounts of debris are created as an outcome of an act that could be viewed as threatening, i.e. a security concern such as a destructive direct descent ASAT test, it's incumbent for this forum to deeply consider this issue. Likewise, as outlined in the first session, we do not accept the proposition that discussions on international humanitarian law in this forum legitimises warfare in space. On the contrary, we think that building a shared understanding of how existing international law, including IHL, applies to outer space contributes to a more predictable and stable world order and enhances security in the space domain. In this regard, on IHL, Australia considers it likely that certain customary international law obligations related to the protection of civilians and civilian objects, which do not have any territorial limitations, apply to conflict conducted in outer space. These rules include the principles of distinction, proportionality, necessity, requirement of precautionary measures, prohibition on the indiscriminate attacks and prohibition on using means and methods of warfare that cause a pro-ferus injury. Chair, we look forward to developing voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible behaviours. Norms, rules and principles complement existing international law and may pave the way for the development of a digital legally binding instrument in the future. As seen in the creation of the Outer Space Treaty, the development of a legally binding instrument is an iterative process founded on open and inclusive discussions. Clinton Clark's presentation on day one underscored that we can monitor behaviours. We recall his demonstrations of some satellites acting predictably and others acting unpredictably. As we continue to develop our collective space situational awareness capabilities, we can better track and understand such behaviours. And as we continue discussions such as these, we can develop our thinking of what patterns of behaviour may be irresponsible and develop approaches to address them. Chair, we are heartened to see a growing support for the US initiative to develop such a norm with its commitment not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests. This is perhaps our first outcome from these discussions. As we now prepare for the January sessions on behaviours, we urge states to consider other such initiatives. What are the behaviours in space states wish to see? What are the behaviours in space states do not wish to see? in the next session to consider these issues and to propose novel solutions. Australia will work to develop its own ideas on potential norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior for discussion at the next session and calls on other states to do the same. Thank you, Chair.",0
S2M1030,2,10,France,"Thank you, Chairman, colleagues. Now as we close this session, I would warmly thank you and thank the experts and the delegations present here that contributed to a particularly enriching debate. Now, during this week of discussions, we have two things that we should remember. First, the quality level of our exchanges. Experts launched our debates. They raised important questions. We have seen a very good level of interaction between delegations present, but also the ownership of this exercise by countries that are participating. And the discussions got better and better as we moved along during this week. And this shows that the fact that we're holding this working group is a positive step towards the common understanding. of what irresponsible behavior and threats may mean. My second point is that our discussions may lead to some conclusions that will guide our future work. And I'll refer to this in greater detail. First space is something for everyone. It's not limited to a group of countries, developed countries or emerging nations. It belongs to everyone. and we had a very rich discussion between those who have space capacities and those who use them. And this is very important. Everyone should be able to participate in this discussion without restriction, and also this should be continued in the future. And we believe that the format of the Open Ended Working Group is indeed the best possible format. Now, also, today we're facing many challenges. in outer space and experts have demonstrated this clearly. So we have to work collectively to move forward and find the means to establish the necessary levels of trust to ensure the peaceful and responsible use of outer space. And then there's a need that was expressed unanimously for greater transparency and the need to reduce the risks and misunderstandings. and uncontrolled escalation. Realizing this, France published its space defense strategy that gives details of its doctrine, the organization, and the roadmap related to capacities, and we urge other countries to do the same. Now, also, we see that there's a need to respond to the most direct and characteristic threats that we face today. First, related to the negative effects on the environment. for example, ASAT tests, then those that may lead to misunderstandings or lead to an escalation leading to disruptions of space systems, for example, cyber attacks as we heard today, and then those that may attack services and critical infrastructure, including civilian populations. These threats are real and we see them today. They're not theoretical or dependent on capacities that... are not being developed. Now Chairman, colleagues, this work should guide us during our next session in order to prepare long term ideas related to our work and we need to develop those rules, principles, and norms of responsible behavior. Now, only through those steps that will build trust and remove the impression of any subjectivity behind the rules of behavior can we lead our work towards the conclusion of legally binding instruments. France, thanks you for your readiness, Chair, to guide us in this work. Thank you.",1
S2M1032,2,10,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Chair. Canada would like to express its gratitude to the Secretariat and to the Chair for their support during this meeting. We also would like to express our gratitude to the experts who presented their views during different panels. The ideas that they shared have led to discussions. about how we can deal with questions related to threats in outer space. Now, we would like to say a few words about the points that were raised and that Canada finds particularly important to review. As was mentioned by panelists d'Arc de Ré, we have a common interest to preserve the sustainability and lasting nature of space activities. All states should focus on the preservation of security, stability, safety, and keep space environment safe is in our common interest. Also outer space as other areas leads to situations of difficulties. tensions and misunderstandings. This means that the work that we're carrying out in this working group is very important and we are convinced that the identification of responsible behavior in outer space is the best possible way in preventing exasperation of situations in outer space in the near term. Many states refer to the fact that responsible behavior is a notion that is vague and subjective. And this is indeed... why the resolution that created this working group was not prescriptive. In fact, the goal of this group is to determine collectively what these notions mean. Together, through the clarification and definition of responsible behavior, we can make them more objective. But this can only be done if states contribute in a constructive manner to these discussions instead of raising... questions related to the terms of reference of this working group. Second, after the discussions yesterday, I believe that we all agree that there is some mixed understandings between delegations working here between capacities and intentions. in outer space. And this is the reason why we publish the objectives of military strategies and budgets. This improves transparency, visibility, instability in outer space. These measures are not political threats, as some may have suggested, but they were recommended as stabilizing state practices that are positive. in the framework of the GGE on transparency and confidence building measures, and the report was published in 2013. We also like to note that these transparency and confidence building measures were accepted by everyone. We encourage therefore all states to put into place such measures and also build on these principles in order to ensure that they're effectively and we can even make them more transparent and we should clarify how space-faring nations can be more transparent and act in a more responsible manner. Finally, we need to stress the point that we all agree on, the best way for a mechanism to strengthen space security and to consider in a comprehensive manner all threats against space objects. And this includes not just satellites, but also infrastructure on land and data links between satellites and the links that connect satellites to terrestrial infrastructure. And as we see, threats to all of this can come from Earth or from outer space. And we also all agree on the importance of preserving the space environment for everyone and to prevent the negative impact on our populations and the impact that such activities may have on our lifestyles. And we know that. Space activities provide great support to our economies. For example, in the interest of all countries, it is essential to prevent the deliberate creation of space debris. Now, there are four times the number of satellites in orbit than in 2010. And we've seen the growing number of space activities over the last recent years. And we cannot allow space orbits to be even more overloaded.",4
S2M1034,2,10,Spain,"Thank you very much, Chair. At the outset, I'd like to congratulate you once again for the... wise way you've been guiding the work of this group. And we also congratulate you on the excellent selection of the panelists and thank them for their statements. It was very interesting to see that industry and civil society participated in our work. We also thank you that multilingualism was promoted during the second sessions. In light of the risks and threats that we have reviewed over this week and with a view to the future, we are looking forward to the third session to see whether we can establish a specific framework on responsible behavior. My delegation believes that such a framework should be based on the following general principles the objectives of sustainability promoted by the United States. Space should be used for peaceful purposes, avoiding the arms race. The use of space objects should respect the use of space objects by others. The use of orbits should not put at risk the activities of other states preserving trajectories and safe distances. give rise to space debris during the use. Communications should be guided by international norms in terms of the designation of frequencies and we should avoid electromagnetic interventions and jamming of communications that are being used through space. We should promote transparency and information related to activities in orbit. ensuring an effective register on satellites that were launched and their identification and space notification mechanisms should be strengthened, and we should improve international cooperation in this context. My delegation is ready to work closely with the presidency and other delegations in order to ensure that we have progress in an efficient manner during the third meeting. Thank you very much.",0
S2M1036,2,10,China,"Mr. Chair, this session of working group meeting is coming to the end. China thanks you and Secretariat for all your efforts to make sure this meeting is a success. The key word of this session is space threat. Given the discussion during this week, all parties still have contrasting views on the meaning and extension of space threat as well as how to deal with this threat. If we cannot reach a complete and comprehensive consensus on this issue, then the future discussions of this working group may hardly reach any meaningful outcomes. Regarding the outcome of this session, China would like to stress the following points. First of all, the discussion on space threat should clearly include policy threats as a fundamental threat. China has pointed out in our statements that the root causes of space threat are the superpower's policy doctrine and strategy aiming for outer space dominance and the subsequent actual battle-oriented space weapon development, force building, and military activities. If we ignore this fundamental threat and only focus on the so-called scenarios threats and develop norms of responsible behaviors only on this basis. I'm afraid this would only exacerbate the risk of weaponization of outer space and the arms race in outer space and will not help maintain lasting peace and security in outer space. Secondly, the research and analysis on concrete space threat should be comprehensive and objective and should avoid being selective and one-sided. During this session, surrounding the physical space threats and different scenarios, all parties have in-depth discussion involving kinetic, non-kinetic, electric, magnetic, and other forms of threats in different scenarios. These discussions will help enhance all parties' understanding on the concrete space threats. exaggerate the threat of kinetic anti-satellite system. This is not conducive to the comprehensive and objective understanding of space threats. By contrast, it will lead the working group astray. Some countries have clearly pointed out that we should avoid mixing the security threat of militarization of outer space with the security risk of peaceful use of outer space. safety – with the safety risk of peaceful use of outer space. These views will help us to have a more comprehensive and objective understanding of the outer space threat. Thirdly, we should pursue a comprehensive, non-discriminatory, and legally binding solution to address these threats. given the discussion during the meeting, most countries support the fundamental goal of preventing arms race in outer space and support negotiating and concluding an international legally binding instrument along this general direction. So as to effectively address the security threat faced in outer space today, some countries pull forward on an initiative to stop the destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile test and call upon other countries to follow suit. Many delegations, including China, raised different views on this issue and pointed out the partiality and discrimination contained in this initiative. It per se mentioned nothing about the development, production, deployment, and use of anti-satellite weapons, does not have any restriction or limitation on proponents' own space force development. Hence, it has no real value in promoting international arms control in outer space. China hopes that different parties' views will be completely and objectively reflected in the Chair's summary in a balanced manner and will become a basis to promote the working group's future work to guarantee meaningful outcomes will be reached. Mr. Chair, as for the next step work of the working group, China would like to share the following thoughts. First of all, we should comprehensively recall the first two sessions and identify the gaps. Given the discussion during these two sessions, all parties still have multiple disagreements on space threat issue, still have different views on the space – all parties still have many different views on the space threat issue. Issues such as de-regard clause – application of the law of armed conflict in outer space, application of the law of the sea and aviation law in the outer space. The relationship between the norms of responsible behaviors and existing international law are still not clear. The relationship between anti-missile and space threat and how to prevent the dual-use space technologies from being used for military purposes and other technical issues remain to be further discussed. we recommend the chairperson and the secretary thoroughly summarize the political, legal, and technical issues that are not fully discussed during these two sessions and continue to facilitate these discussions to lay a solid foundation for the next step work. Secondly, we should uphold the fundamental goal of preventing arms race in outer space. The GA resolution that establishes the working group is adopted under the item prevention of arms race in outer space. Hence the working group should unequivocally oppose defining the outer space as a domain of war. Actively promote the concept of space war cannot be won and cannot be fought. and provide support for the future discussion for the GDE on prevention of arms race in outer space. This working group should be prudent when discussing the peaceful use of outer space and should avoid overlapping with the work of other multiple mechanisms, especially the work of corporates. That is to say, the work that should be dealt with by corporates, this working group should not step in and meddle in the affairs. Thirdly, we should continue the working method by consensus. We should fully respect all parties' views and opinions, consider different views in a balanced manner, and ensure the working groups' discussion are participative, impartial, comprehensive, and inclusive. For a better result of the future discussion, and Chair, you've just mentioned, you will... organize consultations before the third and fourth sessions next year to discuss the plan for next step work and topic to fully listen to the views of different parties. and we appreciate such a approach you proposed. We also look forward to further cooperation and further exchange with you surrounding these topics so as to lay a better foundation for our next two sessions. Mr. Chair. China is ready to fully cooperate with you and all delegations. We'll continue to participate in the working groups discussion. The constructive vendor will make due contributions to the positive outcome of this working group and will jointly work hard for lasting peace and security in outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S2M1038,2,10,Cuba,"Thank you, Chair. Since this is the moment when we're concluding our meeting, I'd like to thank the Secretariat, technical staff, and interpreters for supporting us in our work. You, Chair, would like to thank you for the excellent manner you have been guiding our work. We congratulate you on that, and we believe and hope that this spirit will help us conclude with a very good result based on consensus. And I think we all wish to see that. Now, as a preliminary summary of our work and looking to the future I think our work can be reflected in a context of declaration or preamble on basis of three main ideas reflected in our discussions. Now in the context of preambular part to our work is that we're concerned by the current situation that threatens the three pillars of outer space. First, the peaceful use of outer space. Second, the use of outer space to benefit of humanity. And third, the need to have mechanisms that guarantee the responsibility and liability of all current and future actors in outer space. Now, being pragmatic does not mean we should not stick to our commitments. On the contrary, it's high time for states that for many years denied norms in this area take a step forward and show their true commitment to the general interest and not simply to support narrow natural interests. outer space to the detriment of the interests of others. Now in terms of the summary of the main thing that was discussed here we can say responsible behavior and outer space. Now on substantive elements of our work we believe that we have three fundamental aspects can be at the heart of a summary and when we look... at the way ahead. The first is that all responsible behavior should be clearly established through and on the basis of specific legal regulations of such activities that are considered as a threat to the peaceful use of outer space. and threatened its capacity as a common heritage of mankind. Second, the list of such activities to be regulated should be broad and should begin with the basic one. And some delegations are overlooking this activity. And this is activities related to never placing weapons in outer space. Now to that basic approach, we can add a list of actions that could be as broad as our imagination can be. Of course, we have to keep in mind the work of other fora focusing on questions of outer space, disarmament and nonproliferation. Now the third and final element is that even though confidence building measures are welcome, especially those to declare not to put weapons in outer space first, these CBMs are good but not sufficient. What we need is a legally binding norm to strengthen the existing legal framework related to outer space and guarantee that it can be applied through independent jurisdictional mechanisms of a complementary nature. All of this with a view to guarantee and ensure that space is used exclusively for peaceful purposes and to the benefit of the entire humanity. Chairman, on the basis of three elements, you can count our full support in your future work. Thank you.",4
S2M1040,2,10,India,"At the outset, I wish to appreciate you in particular and your team for deftly spearheading the discussion in this open-ended working group. We also commend you for guiding discussions in an unbiased and neutral manner. Quite like the first session, the program of work for the second session was comprehensive and it has been able to provide for a full discussion on various threats to space systems. We believe that the panel discussions have enriched the understanding on technical as well as legal issues relating to space threats. And it will perhaps guide states to design or consider a framework that takes into account unique characteristics of outer space threats. Mr. Chair, during the course of the session on various outer space threats, we have carefully noted and observed different strands of discussion. In this regard, there are common issues which we would like to reiterate to you and other delegations present here for a fuller consideration. First, we must develop uniform interpretations of existing terminologies in the international law in outer space, such as those contained in the Outer Space Treaty. Overlapping of mandates and duplication of discussions in various fora could be avoided. Voluntary rules, norms, and TCBMs are a useful starting point. Our preference, however, is for a legally binding solution to outer space security because it ensures a higher standard of compliance. Selective focus on some space threats vis-a-vis other threats may impact the process of evolving a common consensus. Interpretation of space behaviors and perception of threats should not suffer from subjectivity in terms of how they are understood and applied. We believe that any suggested norms must be based on objective criterion or methodology to avoid ambiguity in their interpretations. Sixth, with regard to the assessment of responsibility or lack thereof in outer space conduct, we need to address fully as to who and on what basis will the assessments be made. In our understanding, common or collaborative tools for domain awareness in space can contribute to unbiased multilateral verification and build trust in this regard. Seventh, any new suggested norms should also not hinder international cooperation efforts or create new obstacles for emerging space Peaceful and legitimate use of outer space, including science and technology development efforts should not be affected. Mr. Chair, as we conveyed earlier, India's focus is on the use of space for welfare and not for warfare. India is opposed to weaponization of outer space and has not resorted to any armed race in the outer space. In addition, India is a responsible actor in space and adheres to implementation of various measures such as the LTS guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities agreed at the UN COPUS, registration of space objects, pre-launch notifications and measures in line with UN space debris mitigation guidelines. implementation of these guidelines for augmenting outer space safety and through engagement in the relevant fora. In this context, India also has a growing private sector presence in the space industry and we value its perspective on these issues. Mr. Chair. India's views on this OEWG process are recorded in the explanation of what UNGA resolutions 76 slash 231. Let me reiterate that as in the past, India will support international endeavors providing for greater certainty and predictability in the outer space environment provided they take into account the issues discussed earlier. We will contribute constructively to this process and look forward to the sessions next year. Thank you.",4
S2M1042,2,10,The Islamic Republic of Iran,"Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the conduct of this meeting with very patience as well as I thank the very rich discussion by the panelists so far. Mr. Chairman, I also would like to thank the Secretariat for organizing of this meeting. Mr. Chairman, in this second meeting, we were witnessing once more that on the issue of mandate of this OEWG, there are two school of thoughts, if I may say, and these two views and positions are, in our understanding, yet very far apart to be covered. As said before, we are very glad that both sides are very seriously engaged in this discussion. Therefore, as you have just said, we hope that the next summary of your summary consider multilateralism and opinions of all to be treated in equal footing. Therefore, the OEWG process should take the objective and realistic attitude towards the different positions of member states. Efforts should be made to avoid discrimination or give exclusive priority to some approaches that was discussed during this OEWG process. The principle of consensus is of yet great importance. we shoot serve as an important element of processing any outcome or recommendations for the next meeting. We are expecting that the discussion on the future recommendation will be treated on a multilateralism and in very equal footing. Of course, I do not envy you to be chair of this OEWG. witnessed. We are yet far, very far from any consensus on the issue. Thank you so much.",2
S2M1045,2,10,Russia,"Thank you very much, Chair. But it seemed to me that the delegation of Germany raised their nameplate before us, so we would suggest giving the floor to the delegation of Germany because they've been waiting quite some time. Thank you.",2
S2M1047,2,10,Germany,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, we would like to thank you for the way you guided our work and enabled a rich and constructive discussion on the pressing security challenges in outer space. The contributions of the briefers have significantly increased our understanding of the various threats to space security, and I would like to thank colleagues for their insightful and stimulating contributions, which have provided ample food for thought for further discussions. Looking back at this session, I believe we should take stock that characterized our discussions and the issues which need further discussion. I would like to make four points. First... Space security is affected by a broad spectrum of underlying conditions, increasing risks of misperception and a wide range of threats which are perceived differently by states depending how they rely on space. As many briefers have outlined, the military use of outer space is a reality. Nowadays, satellite communication as well as positioning, navigation and timing are crucial not only for civil society but also for militaries around the world. While certain threatening activities in outer space are already prohibited by international law, for example the use of force in, from and to space, a wide range of behaviors is not, but may lead to risks of escalation. Transparency on programs and strategies is thus urgently needed and could be a first step to reduce the risks of misunderstanding, which eventually leads to escalation. Second, space security is not only essential for strategic stability, but matters to all states as our economies and populations depend to an unprecedented extent on a reliable provision of space-based services. Our discussions have shown that the use of space has changed fundamentally over the last decades. While some concepts for military capabilities in orbits, such as space-based interceptors, were discussed for the first time many years ago and are still not under active development, the dependence of our way of life and our socio-economic development on space has created new vulnerabilities which were inconceivable previously. Over the course of the week, we discussed threats to the secure use of space services for similar communications, navigation or disaster relief, which can have far-reaching consequences. We should thus address threats to the provision of such critical space-based services to the public as a priority in our further work. The intentional creation of debris, endangering the safe and sustainable use for all states through the destructive testing of direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles, is a pressing and urgent threat. But of course, it needs to be complemented by other measures to strengthen space security in a holistic way. Germany fully supports efforts for the creation of a universal norm banning such testing. We see such efforts as part of an iterative and incremental approach to augment the normative framework of space security. In the same way as the outer space treaty was drafted on the basis of a number of UN General Assembly resolutions, a political commitment not to conduct such testing may, together with other outcomes of our work, pave the way for a comprehensive set of rules covering all relevant threats, both from Earth and on orbit. Fourth, a behavioural approach is a pragmatic way to address potential threats emanating from the dual-use nature of many space objects. exposed the challenges to space security stemming from a nefarious use of space systems and technologies, which were designed for other peaceful activities. Important examples are rendezvous and proximity operations, mission extension vehicles, robotic arms, harpoons and nets for active debris removal. Industry standards on rendezvous and proximity operations reflect best practices such as avoiding contact or minimizing close approaches. As we should not limit the development of these technologies, which will contribute to the sustainability of our use of outer space, behavioral standards offer a means to prevent misunderstanding and escalation. Looking forward to our next session, Mr. Chair, let me assure you of the full support of this delegation for the continuation of this open, interactive and constructive process. As we move into the second half of our work, we should remind ourselves that the focus of this group lies on identifying behaviors to reduce space threats and is agnostic as to whether they are best implemented through voluntary measures or legally binding instruments. We firmly believe that responsible behaviors can be both complementary to legally binding instruments as well as a preparatory step towards the negotiation of them. We also believe that responsible behaviors will help to create conditions where risk of escalation and conflict in space are mitigated and states have no incentive for contesting outer space or engaging in arms races. In this sense, our work here is an essential contribution to wider efforts on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Thank you.",0
S2M1049,2,10,Russia,"Thank you very much, Chair. Allow me at the outset to echo the words of gratitude that have already been expressed by other delegations to you as well as to the Secretariat. We would also like to share a number of our views with regard to this OEWG session and also to present our thoughts with regard to the preparations for the next session, as well as the future organization of work under the OEWG as a whole. First and foremost, we believe it to be necessary and indeed very highly required that the OEWG and its work closely follow the key aims of international space law linked to issues of international peace and security. This is because... This group was created by GA resolution. and also the first committee. And the main goals. that the OEWG is supposed to enable are preventing an arms race in space, as well as preserving space as a domain which can be used for research and exploration for people's peaceful purposes, all states, by all states on an equal basis. Given these goals, our position remains unchanged. To achieve them, we can only achieve them by having generally recognized legally binding norms of international law which are comprehensive in nature and which are strictly aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space. In this regard, we believe it to be highly critical that the OEWG take into account the following factor. We need to strongly base ourselves on current international space law. We need to strictly follow and take into account the norms of international space law, which have already been approved by the UN's member states. the fundamental norms and basis for the OEWG is above all the 1967 outer space treaty. And in this regard, we shouldn't try to work within the OEWG to revise current international space law. but quite the opposite, we should rather attempt to maintain those norms to preserve them. At the same time, we should try, through consensus, to identify potential areas and segments or niches. in international space law. which we think could be added to by additional norms. but these additional norms should not at all substitute for the current norms, they should just add to them. Moreover, in the future work of the group, we also need to take into account national legislation of the state's participants. when it comes to space activities linked to space activities. From our part, the Russian Federation. will strictly comply with our military doctrine of the Russian Federation. That doctrine has agreed upon definitions of the threat, threats to states, stemming from space, in particular to our country. And in regard to a particular threat, we would identify the threat of placement of weapons in space. and a military threat would be disrupting control systems of space. So given these provisions of Russia's military doctrine. we are going to act in line with those concepts, in particular in the future work of the group. We will also be basing ourselves on the definitions of military risk and threat, which we have in Russia's military doctrine. These are the fact that the Russian Federation understands as a military risk. a situation in intergovernmental, interstate operations when there are a number of factors acting together which in certain circumstances might lead to a military threat rising. Moreover, we understand a situation between internal state affairs or intra-state affairs to be when an armed conflict may arise. between confrontational parties who, when a state or a group of states has a high level of readiness or when there are separatist or terrorist organizations who stand ready to use military force or violence. more of them. The OEWG and its future work should be guided by the principle of inclusivity. This principle is enshrined in the mandate of this group, and we fully agree with the delegation of the United Kingdom here. because the principle of consensus is the basis of the work of the OEWG, it's the basis of decision making at this group, and that can all be enabled by inclusivity. Our delegation believes that this principle is one of the key principles. This is because... Issues related to space activities and issues related to space security are directly related to issues of international peace and security. And any decisions in that area can only be taken, taking into account all of the interested UN member states and in no other way. Because otherwise, a situation would arise. in which between UN member states there would be more dividing lines drawn up and as a result of such non-inclusive decisions a very serious damage would be done to international security and stability. Moreover, the OEWG should also be guided in its future work. by the principles of constructiveness. and not allowing our discussions to be politicised. We greatly regret the fact that there have been attempts by a number of delegations during this current session to give the discussions a politicized nature and to use their interventions. to make unsubstantiated and provocative and highly politicized statements and expressing views against the Russian Federation of that nature, including on topics which are not at all linked to the OEWG's mandate and are not at all linked to the topics that we're discussing here. The Russian Federation would like to warn delegations from taking such provocative approaches. like to caution them because such attempts will only lead to one thing. They will draw up dividing lines between the participants in this discussion and they will also threaten the achievement of consensus when it comes to achieving any decisions within this group. We believe that... that such attempts to politicize things are very destructive in nature and in fact they don't enable the group to achieve its goals. share. in its work, hold to a comprehensive approach. The OEWG should avoid attempts to consider issues related to space security in a selective manner. We cannot establish priority areas with regard to space security or subsidiary issues. we can't try to divide up different areas in this sphere, dividing them into real or hypothetical ones. these problems. are to do with international security and strategic stability. And when we consider such issues, there are no subsidiary or priority issues. All of the topics are priority topics. That's because they ensure a balance in international security and they aim at ensuring international security. If this is not the case... we will see the standard traditional dilemma that often comes up when you have the shield and the sword. This is because ensuring stability in a strategic area can only be done through the shield and the sword. and having a selective approach either gets rid of the shield or the sword. from certain states or groups of states, and this is unacceptable when we're speaking about international security and strategic stability. And this principle is directly pertinent to issues of space security. In this regard, the initiative which has been to adopting non-binding obligations with regard to the tests of anti-satellite systems is in fact selective in nature. And this initiative creates a division. between states who have such a potential and states who cannot possess such a potential. Moreover, without additional measures, a situation would in fact arise which would be discriminatory and which would also mean that certain states might have, might not have their shield. and other states might continue to have a sword and be able to develop and continue to develop improved modifications of their sword. And as we already said, such attempts will only lead to undermining international security and strategic stability. More of a president, we believe it to be very important that in our work at this group that we avoid overlapping in the work between what's being done at other fora. Most importantly, the United Nations Committee in Vienna. This does not contribute to the forwarding of the goals of our group. But even more importantly, it undermines our work in other international forums. Especially in Copus, as we said earlier, but also in other forums that discuss issues related to international information security. This is something that we do not need. It is, in fact, counterproductive. And this creates confusion. and this creates problems not just for our open-ended working group but also for the other four that I referred to. It is clear that we should take into account what is being done in other four but we should not duplicate... and we should definitely not replace or substitute them in any way or to try to drag over some bits of the work that is being carried out there in other international four and discuss them here in this working group. We also believe that it would be useful for the open-ended working group to stick to a purely legal approach in its work. We need to use purely legal categories here in what we do, and such categories such as perceptions, intentions. These are not legal categories, and they're subjective in their nature. And we believe they cannot be used in the work of this group. And we know that the objective of this group is to achieve legal results. It doesn't matter whether they're binding or non-binding. In any case, if we wish to achieve results that would contribute to the filling of gaps that exist in international space law, we should be guided by strictly legal categories. And this is why. we must understand that transparency measures are confidence building measures in space-related activities. Those are not some type of separate measures. But these are measures that are legal measures, even though they may not be binding measures. And this is why such measures should be based on legal practice. They should use legal categories. and keep in mind those existing norms of International Space Law that are there. And in all of this, we have to understand clearly that any transparency or confidence building measures in space-related activities... These measures should complement and not substitute legally binding instruments or tools. This is the basis of our position. And also, we believe that such transparency and confidence building measures in space should be focused on the complete prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space, the use of force, or the threat of the use of force against space objects. and this is why we'd like to caution. that the agreement of some non-inclusive rules of space activities that do not take into account the views of all UN member states and that are intended to ensure the domination in outer space of a small group of countries. measures or steps that are not focused on solving the main issue related to the prevention of the arms race in outer space. All of this would not help us promote international peace and security and would lead to the escalation of tensions in outer space and further divisions in the international community and limit equal access to outer space and its use for peaceful purposes. Distinguished Chairperson, we would like to ask you to keep in mind these assessments, these views as you prepare the Chair's summary after the second meeting of the Open Internet Working Group. especially the proposals that we made on numerous occasions to ensure that we take a comprehensive approach to the consideration of the issue of threats in outer space and potential responsible or irresponsible actions or behavior in outer space. This relates to the proposal for the banning of use of space objects for targeting any targets in outer space, in airspace, and on the ground. This also relates to the creation and tests of weapons in outer space for carrying out any possible tasks. And this also relates to the creation, testing, deployment, and use of space weapons for anti-satellite defense purposes as ASAT systems for the use against targets on the ground or in the air. And this also relates to the destruction, damage, and violation of the operational functioning and the change in the trajectories of space objects nations. This also relates to the provision of assistance and encouraging other states or groups of states, international, intergovernmental, or any non-governmental organizations in the participation in the activities mentioned above. So This means that the Russian Federation believes that the OEWG should achieve results that would... ensure the realization of objectives that cannot be reviewed related to the prevention of the arms race in outer space and the elaboration of a relevant international legally binding instrument that would include guarantees, the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space, the use of force, or the threat of the use of force against space objects or with the use of space objects.,no conceptual differences between the notion of a legally binding instrument and the approach based on behavior. We don't see any differences there. The only difference, in fact, is political will of countries to take legally binding obligations. Thank you.",4
S2M1051,2,10,Argentina,"Thank you. Since this is the first time my delegation is taking the floor during the second session, my delegation would like to congratulate you once again on your hard work and the professional way you've been guiding the work of this session. My delegation would like to make the following considerations related to this session, the upcoming work. And contribute to the preparation of the summary of the chair related to this period of work. Now we'd like to reiterate the continued importance and applicability of the 67 Outer Space Treaty and other regulations that are based on the premise that the exploration and use of outer space should be only for peaceful purposes and in the interest and benefit of the entire non-peaceful activities in outer space may serve the interests of single country or group countries, but non-peaceful activities can never be to the benefit or in the interest of the international community as stipulated by Article 1 of the Outer Space Treaty in this respect. And with the view of the final report that the Chair will be preparing for adoption during see the document not focus on questions of future militarization of outer space or that outer space may become an area for warfare or an area for domination. On the contrary, our delegation would like to see reflected and stress the existing international norms related to outer space that stipulate that outer space can never be used for the weapons or any other types of WMD and its sole use for the improvement of the well-being and peace between people. Also another point that my delegation mentioned during the first meeting of this group in May of this year and we'd like to see this reflected in the report of the group is the fact that there's a legal gap in the current legal regime that does not contain any restrictions related to conventional weapons in terrestrial orbits and this gap is really clear in comparison to what the outer space treaty says. In this respect This group should make a clear recommendation in its report in the respect that it is not legitimate to place any types of weapons in outer space. Another recommendation that my delegation believes this group should include in its report is to promote the importance to prevent arms race in outer space. urging the conference on disarmament to begin immediately the negotiation of a treaty to prevent an arms race in outer space that prevents the placement of conventional weapons and WMD in outer space. A treaty on Paris should include regulations of space-related activities and also control of capacities, equipment and technologies. If the CDE cannot agree on a Paris on the basis of consensus, confidence building and transparency measures are welcome, but in no way can they replace or delay the negotiations of legally binding Normans. In light of the discussions held in this group on the notion of threat, my delegation would like to say that the Commission on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space Copas is the appropriate forum of the United Nations to discuss issues related to the regulation of outer space, and that commission studies and prepares recommendations, different norms, rules, and principles of to threats to space-based systems. In this respect, my delegation believes that it is important to avoid that the work of our open-ended working group overlap with the excellent work carried out by COPUS as the forum for discussion of issues of the peaceful use of outer space, and for that reason we should avoid that norms, regulations, rules, and guidelines that are discussed reviewed or considered in parallel way by our group. And we have an example, for example, mitigation of space debris, something that was discussed here in our open-ended working group, but indeed this is a subject matter for COPUS, and we should not continue with this overlap in our work. Thank you.",4
S2M1053,2,10,The Australian Center for Space Governance,"Thank you so much, Chair, and I do truly appreciate the opportunity that you've provided for civil society to contribute to discussions here. I wanted to start by echoing what all of the state delegations have had by thanking you and your team for such an excellent guidance of all the discussions, and in particular commending the diversity of the experts who've been presenting. There's been gender diversity, linguistic diversity, disciplinary in terms of disciplines, and also regional and international representation. incredibly important, not only in light of the side event that we held this week on diversity and inclusivity, but also indeed as Russia has said, inclusivity is a key principle here. So I really commend the work that you have done to present this. And in that respect, I think what that demonstrates as delegates have also highlighted the value of having the input of those experts. It really highlights the multi-stakeholder nature of space. input is incredibly important to inform the thinking of states. I fully appreciate the move that you suggested that the next session will really be moving to a much more formal mode with states working together on formulating norms, rules and principles and I do hope that even in light of that there'll still be room for civil society to continue to contribute as part of that multi-stakeholder environment. So my gratitude to the Chair and his team. Thank you.",1
S4M12,4,1,Philippines (Multi-Country),"Mr. Chair, I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ireland, Italy, Finland, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway. Panama, Peru, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Sierra Leone, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, and my own country, the Philippines. We thank you and the Secretariat for your tireless efforts to make this OEWG a success. We jointly express our appreciation for the OEWG process, which has inspired open, substantive, and inclusive efforts. interactive and enlightening discussions pertaining to outer space security. We believe the OEWG has proven itself as a constructive platform for an inclusive dialogue among member states with the participation of all relevant stakeholders on reducing space threats. It is complementary with the mandates of the Conference on Disarmament, the United Nations Disarmament Commission, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the United and the newly established group of government experts on further practical measures for the prevention of an arms race in outer space. It also supports the PIROS agenda. The sessions of the OEWG have demonstrated a significant interest among states in finding converging views on reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors. We welcome your draft consensus report as a solid basis for our work on the OEWG's report. We urge all delegations to work with an open mind and a flexible and constructive spirit towards a substantive report that will reflect the following elements. First, the report should note that the OEWG has taken stock of existing international legal and other normative frameworks. concerning threats and risks arising from behaviors with respect to outer space. It should, among others, reaffirm the continued applicability of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. It should note the provisions of the Outer Space Treaty that are relevant to the OEWG's work, and reaffirm that applicable international law also includes other relevant treaties. as well as costumary international law, the law of state responsibility, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law. Second, the report should note that the OEWG has considered current and future threats by states to space systems and actions, activities, and emissions that could be considered irresponsible. It should affirm that work on elaborating norms of responsible behaviors in outer space is a useful means towards addressing threats in outer space. All activities by states in outer space must be carried out in accordance with international law. It is also important that such activities are conducted with due regard to the corresponding rights and interests of other states. It should note that the OEWG provided an important opportunity for states and other stakeholders to enhance their understanding of how states view threats to outer space security, including in space to earth, space to space, earth to space, and earth to earth dimensions. Third, the report should contain recommendations on possible norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors relating to threats by states to space systems, including, as appropriate, how they would contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments including on Paros. While we acknowledge that much work needs to be undertaken this week to achieve consensus on many areas, we believe that consensus could be found on the following thematic areas. Application of existing international law to the space environment, enhancing transparency in building confidence, addressing the threats of destruction and incapacitation of space objects which generate debris. addressing rendezvous operations and proximity operations that could increase the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation, and protecting critical space-based services to civilians. Finally, the report should further reaffirm that political commitments on responsible behaviors can be developed in support of and without prejudice to the pursuit of legally binding measures and instruments in this area. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive. Mr. Chair, the work we have done in this OEWG is an excellent starting point that complements other efforts related to enhancing outer space security, including the newly established GGE on Paros. A follow-up process to the ongoing OEWG aimed at further convergence between these tracks should be considered. The inclusive nature of this process in terms of both participation of stakeholders and the range of issues and measures that could be discussed, makes it an invaluable platform that ensures that all the voices of all states are heard on an issue that affects us all. Our delegations will continue to work constructively during and beyond this OEWG to ensure the success of this process. Thank you.",1
S4M14,4,1,EU,"Thank you Mr. Chair. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the European Union and its member states. We would like to congratulate you and your team for your excellent work in steering the work of this open-ended working group during the three first substantial sessions and continuing to do so in this last session that aims at adopting the final report of our collective work. We appreciate your efforts in submitting as a road draft for our consideration after the extensive consultations with all parties. and we would like to ensure you of our continued support and cooperation for reaching consensus on the report. Mr. Chair, improving space security today is essential as all states, be them space-faring nations or not, are increasingly reliant on space systems and services. The EU and its member states continue to support effective multilateralism with the United Nations at its core in order to ensure a safer, and sustainable world. We will continue to do our utmost to protect the integrity of the rules-based international system which is key to our collective security and the cornerstone of the EU's common foreign and security policy. The EU and its member states fully supported the establishment of the Open-ended Working Group on reducing space threats as a pragmatic step in a cooperative and comprehensive process that helps to build... a common understanding of what can be considered responsible and irresponsible behaviors. The EU has made several joint contributions and several EU member states have submitted national or cross-regional working papers. We welcome the active engagement demonstrated during this process, which shows the commitment of United Nations member states and relevant organizations to address the issue of reducing space threats through norms, rules, and regulations. and principles of responsible behaviors. The EU and its member states consider that the comprehensive work undertaken within the open-ended working group using an inclusive format and a multi-stakeholder approach and encouraging the attendance of other international organizations, commercial actors, and civil society representatives has significant value in addressing space threats to international peace and security. This approach has played an important role in scaling down the risks of misunderstandings, misperceptions, miscalculations and unintended escalation as it is a confidence building measure in itself. Therefore, we consider that the final report should duly reflect the effectiveness and usefulness of this cooperative and comprehensive approach. The EU and Member States will comment on the conclusions and recommendations proposed in the Zero Draft Report received last week. We already consider, however, that the final report should recommend a short but consistent list of possible future norms, rules and principles on areas of convergence based on positions expressed by a majority of states and taking into account that some more urgent and tangible threats should be treated with higher priority than others. These possible norms should then be further discussed and advanced as a part of the work of a new open-ended working group or any relevant follow-up process. The EU and its member states consider that the final report should provide guidance on how this work can be further advanced within the UN system, and building upon the trust and confidence generated through our collaborative endeavour. In conclusion, Mr Chair, in this context, I am honoured to repeat today the commitment of the Member States of the European Union that have made in the joint EU contribution to the works of this open-ended working group in June not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests. The Member States of the EU consider indeed such commitment which responds to the resolution 77 slash 41 adopted by the General Assembly in December last year, as an urgent and an initial measure aimed at preventing damage to the outer space environment while also contributing to the development of further measures for the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M16,4,1,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor at the beginning of this fourth and final session of the Open-Ended Working Group on Reducing Space Threats through Norms, Rules, and Principles of Responsible Behavior. I want to start by thanking you and the Secretariat for your hard work, your dedication, your professionalism, and support of this process. Since we last met in January, you and the team have done an exceptional job in taking the excellent inputs from our discussions in the OEWG. conversations, statements, and papers, and weaving those ideas together into the Consolidated Elements Paper and the Zero Draft of the final report. We also commend you for the inclusive approach you have taken to this process, making yourself available for bilateral consultations and holding informal consultations with all interested parties. It is clear that you have made substantial efforts to seek comments and inputs and have sought to consider the positions of all countries in your approach to the Zero Draft. Mr. Chair, before we get into the substance of your excellent draft report, it is useful to step back and take a moment to reflect on the revolutionary, world-changing events that are occurring almost daily in outer space. From weather forecasts to navigation to communication, space has become an essential tool driving prosperity and security for all states. For many years, the United Nations underpinned the mechanisms of preventing conflict from occurring in outer space. Major steps were taken, such as the establishment of the Paros Agenda in SSOD 1, the creation of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the Four Core Treaties, notably the Outer Space Treaty, which bans the placement in orbit of the world's most destructive weapons in outer space. along with increased threats to our collective ability to operate and explore space freely. We must preserve the global benefits that space provides, reduce the threats to the outer space environment from irresponsible actions such as the destructive testing of anti-satellite missiles, and reduce the risks of miscalculation and misinterpretation that could lead to conflict. to take fruitless steps to improve our understanding of the risks from conflict in outer space and take meaningful action toward developing concrete proposals that address these threats. Mr. Chair, in the view of the United States, the discussions at the OEWG have been constructive, substantive and focused on fulfilling the mandate set out in UN General Assembly Resolution 76-231. We have spent considerable time in extensive conversations. regarding the existing legal regime, current and future threats, and ideas for norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior. Your leadership has been essential in guiding this important work. In the current environment of tension and mistrust, it is important that we take tangible and concrete steps to address the risks of misunderstanding that could potentially lead to conflict or a degradation of the outer space environment. All countries use outer space. whether they launch their own satellites, field their own satellites, or benefit directly from satellites. We must take steps to reduce the various risks to all of us by using this process to develop norms of behavior that can strengthen peace and stability for all of us. As we discussed at the last session of the OEWG, the United States believes that the most urgent threat to space systems comes from destructive testing of Earth-to-space reckless destructive direct descent anti-satellite missile testing affects all nations, including the developing world, by degrading critical space services like weather, navigation, and communication. As an urgent but initial measure to address this issue, last year at the UNGA, the United States introduced what became Resolution 77-41 on destructive direct descent anti-satellite missile testing. calls upon all countries to commit not to conduct destructive direct-descent anti-satellite missile tests. This is why the United States welcomes the language in paragraph 36 of the draft OEWG report regarding such tests. The United States welcomes the recent announcement by the European Union that its member states have made national commitments in line with the UNGA resolution. That brings the total number of states worldwide making such national commitments to 35 countries. we encourage other countries to make such a national commitment. It is through all states making and observing these national commitments that this can become an internationally recognized norm of responsible behavior. Mr. Chair, another tangible step was the convening of this OEWG. The draft report you have prepared reflects difficult debates which covers complex and technical issues, including issues on which not every state agrees. The United States appreciates the inclusion in the draft report of ideas contained in the various papers that we submitted to this OEWG. We recognize that our ideas are just that, ideas from one of many countries. They may not be perfect. They are simply proposals to consider. We recognize that others have differing ideas on what could reduce risks in this domain. In this regard, we welcome the joint statement in support of the OEWG, read on behalf of a cross-regional group of states. and commend the spirit of cooperation it highlights. As such, Mr. Chair, the United States also appreciates your crafting of the Chappell language for the section on recommendations. Let me focus for a minute on paragraph 36 in the draft report. This language is quite clear that the recommendations presented are ideas to which states could give further consideration. They are not, or at least not yet, agreed proposals, but ones that require further study. The breadth of proposals identified is impressive, and I know that they were drawn from the submissions of multiple countries. Yet, despite the exceptional discussions we have had, there is more work to be done on these proposals so that we can reach consensus on a set of norms, rules, and principles. The United States also takes note of the language in paragraph 36 that the list of proposals is without prejudice to the national positions of states participating in the working group. that the United States has concerns about some of these proposals. But we agree that they are proposals that some states have raised in the working group. That is a factual matter, and that they should be discussed. We are prepared to make our case regarding the merits of our own positions on these issues. Mr. Chair. For those states that plan to agree that some proposals should not be included in this list of recommendations, I would urge you to find ways to seek compromise so that the interests of all parties can be adequately reflected in the final report. The United States, for its part, will approach our work constructively and cooperatively. In doing so, It is important to remember that these issues are complex and will require careful and deliberate study. While we all seek to develop norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior, including those that would contribute to a future legally binding instrument, we must also do so in a thorough, meticulous manner. Rather than rush through recommendations which may result in unintended consequences or inadvertently constrain new or novel activities, we owe ourselves a thoughtful, deliberative process. Our governments, our people, our industries, and future generations rely on that work. That is a demonstration of responsible diplomatic behavior. Mr. Chair, it is for this reason, even if we complete this week's meeting, that we With a set of consensus recommendations, the United States supports the calls to continue our discussions in another open-ended working group on developing norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior. As the draft paper suggests, there are many ideas that need further consideration by steps and also further input from organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross and from other non-governmental organizations. through their participation has provided us with an important perspective on these issues. Given the robust, substantive, and concrete suggestions we have had in this forum, we hope other states will support further work in this area in the future. I thank you very much.",1
S4M18,4,1,Germany,"Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor. Mr. Chair, colleagues, Germany marks this year the 50th anniversary of its succession to the United Nations on 18 September, 1973. For five decades, membership in the UN and global engagement in a multilateral framework have been one of the essential backbones of Germany's foreign policy. To mark this historical date, The Federal Foreign Office organized a public event in Berlin with German astronaut Matthias Maurer from the European Space Agency. He spent in 2021 and 2022 175 days on board of the International Space Station, ISS, and shared his impressions with the audience. He described how the crew of the International ISS lives like a big family in a small shared flat. as well as other highlights like his own walk in space that lasted seven hours. But he also mentioned rare moments of absolute silence on board, for instance when ISS entered the cloud of space debris generated by a destructive ACID test shortly before or when the station flew over a blacked out Ukraine in early spring 2022. He concluded his talk. Our blue planet Earth looks like a little spacecraft too, a spacecraft crewed by the whole humanity which has shared responsibility for it and must take care of it. I think these words perfectly underpin the work at this OEWG. Our work makes a difference in practical as well as philosophical terms. Germany. fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the representative of the European Union and the joint statement delivered on behalf of the Group of Friends in support of the OEWG by the representative of the Philippines. We are particularly pleased by the broad support for the joint statement by 33 states which shows that a cross-regional view on the usefulness of internationally recognised norms of responsible and converging. As our daily life is increasingly dependent on space-based services, we believe that such norms are equally beneficial to spacefaring, emerging spacefaring and not-yet-spacefaring nations. From the outset, Germany supported the work of this group and would like to thank the chair and his able and dedicated team from ODA for steering us through three substantial sessions and presenting a substantive and balanced first draft of the final report. We have been pleased with the richness of the debate and with the state's substantive engagements on responsible behaviors dealing with space security. We have been working towards a better understanding and awareness regarding the existing legal framework, security threats and elements for norms of responsible behaviours in outer space. We deeply appreciated the inclusiveness and constructiveness of this working group. Germany believes that the final report should in the first place reflect the value added and usefulness of norms of responsible behaviour. They can mitigate space threats leading to escalation and conflict, and significantly contribute to preventing an arms race in outer space. Norms of responsible behaviors are complementary with the mandates of the Conference on Disarmament, Resolution of the General Assembly, UN Disarmament Commission, and Committee of Peaceful Uses in Outer Space, COPWAS. As politically binding commitments, they can pave the way powered legally binding instrument. Mr. Chair, the report rightly takes a comprehensive approach to security threats and should consider the different vectors they might possess. Germany, together with many other countries, including all UN member states, committed not to conduct direct ascent destructive anti-zetalite tests. Norms of responsible behaviours are best suited to address the dual use character many space objects inherently have, as well as the specific nature of rendezvous and proximity operations. Such norms can better capture the complex interrelationship of capabilities, intention and actual use, which in combination may lead to real and perceived threats by States. Germany has recently adopted its first ever national security strategy, Preserving and developing the global arms control architecture is one of its goals. The strategy further states that outer space is not a rules-free area, and a dedicated space security strategy will set down the future strands of action. We believe that strategies and policies made public can play a very positive role as means of transparency and should be accordingly reflected by the final report. Mr. Chair, we welcome that the draft final report reaffirms the applicability of international law in outer space, including all relevant international treaties, customary international law and international humanitarian law. We should be further working towards a consolidated common terminology which facilitates and shapes the discussion on space security between states and establish criteria for better distinguishing norms of responsible behaviours from TCBMs, as they are not the same. Mr Chair, regrettable. Regrettably, we have to take this opportunity to condemn the DPRK again for its unlawful act by launching a so-called military reconnaissance satellite using ballistic missile technology on August 24. These space-related activities constitute a flagrant violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. It is important to acknowledge that we are still in the middle of the process. The work the OEWG has done so far is an excellent starting point. We wish that the report will show areas of convergence and provide further guidance on future working strands of responsible behaviours. We are in favour of setting up a follow-up OEWG which allows us to deepen our discussion in an inclusive, both... in both formative and substance manner. So please be assured Mr. Chair that our delegation is approaching this week in a spirit of compromise and we are looking forward for a successful outcome. Thank you very much.",1
S4M110,4,1,Netherlands,"In addition to the statement delivered on behalf of the European Union and the cross-regional joint statement delivered by the Philippines on behalf of 33 states, I would like to make the following remarks in my national capacity. Chair, allow me to start by thanking you for your work as Chair. Under your able leadership, the Open-ended Working Group has resulted in some truly commendable achievements, fostering a substantive and inclusive debate among states, and other stakeholders. Furthermore, the OEWG has significantly advanced cross-regional discussions on space security issues. Given the rapid technological developments and the growing dependencies within the space domain, promoting responsible behaviour on outer space is of utmost importance. We believe that establishing norms of responsible behaviour is complementary to the rules laid out in existing international law, rather than being a matter of competition. Building trust and confidence, implementing practical measures and abiding by globally accepted norms and principles for responsible behaviour can go hand in hand with strengthening the current framework of legally binding measures. Therefore, the OEWG has contributed in its own way to the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Chair, this week we gather to work on an outcome document that serves the common goal of reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours. In our view, this document should reaffirm our commitment to the timely registration of information in the United Nations Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space. In addition, we consider that the De Haag Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation should be specifically referenced. Another confidence-building measure that should be included is the UN Global Points of Contact Directory. In accordance with Article 3 of the Outer Space Treaty, we must acknowledge that the entire body of international law applies in outer space. The law-bound conflict, both the use at Bellum and the use in Bello, are applicable in outer space as they are on Earth. Chair, it's misleading to argue that universal recognition of the applicability of international humanitarian law would increase the chances of armed conflict in space. The regulation of conceivable threats does not cause these threats to occur, nor does a lack of regulation prevent them from occurring in any way. Clearly, the exact opposite is true. We recognize the impact of activities in space on civil society, and reiterate that no distinction should be made between civilian and military space systems. And we emphasize the importance of synergy between the various fora dealing with space safety, security and sustainability. We also underline the value of a multi-stakeholder approach. We thus welcome the inclusive process of the Open-ended Working Group, which has brought together various stakeholders from both private and public sectors. Other relevant topics we need to seek agreement this week on include, but are not limited to addressing the creation of space debris by the destruction of space systems, rendezvous and proximity operations, transparency and confidence building measures, and wider sharing of space situational awareness data for monitoring responsible behaviour in space. Chair. Looking ahead, it's crucial that the work in the upcoming GGE on Paros builds on the achievements of this open-ended working group. Furthermore, the Kingdom of the Netherlands is committed to preserve the momentum built by the OEWG and would be supportive of a continuity of the working group process in some form. Preferably, this follow-up would start after the closure of the GGE on Paros to prevent them from running in parallel. Chair, let me conclude by saying you can continue to count on the full support of my delegation to work towards a substantive, consensus outcome. I thank you, Chair.",1
S4M112,4,1,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will keep my opening remarks relatively brief as we have a busy week ahead of us. But before we get onto the substantive business of discussing our draft report, I did want to reflect on the remarkable journey that has brought us to this fourth and final meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group. That journey began almost three years ago when UN member states voted overwhelmingly in favor of resolution 75 slash 36. which invited states to reflect on existing and potential threats to space systems and on how these could be addressed through the development and implementation of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours. Since then, through the national reports that were submitted in response to that resolution, the subsequent report from the Secretary General, and now through the work of this OEWG, The international debate on outer space security has, in my delegation's view, shifted significantly. Through our discussions, we have improved our understanding of what each of us finds concerning and potentially threatening in the actions, activities and omissions of other states in, to and from outer space. We may not all agree on what may be considered threatening or on the solutions. But we have, we hope, improved mutual understanding. And in today's context, that is an important step forward in itself. It seems to us that the focus on behaviors rather than on capabilities has proved its worth. We have made early practical progress. The wide support for UNGA resolution 77 slash 41, calling on states to commit not to destructively test is a clear step forwards in reducing threats to the space systems on which we all rely. We hope that more states will make this political commitment and that such commitments will amount to a new globally accepted norm of behaviour. While ASAP testing is a pressing concern, it is not the only one. Thanks to the inclusive nature of this OEWG, we have ensured that all states, not just the established space have had the opportunity to express their concerns and to put forward their ideas and proposals. We have been truly impressed by the constructive and substantive engagement from so many delegations over the course of this process. We have been struck by the collaborative approach that so many member states have demonstrated, including across what we might term as traditional regional boundaries. The statement delivered earlier by the Distinguished Ambassador of the Philippines on behalf of 33 states is a great example of this, and we thank the delegation of Brazil, the Philippines, the Netherlands and Germany for their leadership of this initiative. We have also taken a significant step forwards when it comes to bridging the perceived divide between legally binding and politically binding commitments. It is clear to us that these two approaches are complementary, and norms, rules and principles encompasses both of these as well as traditional transparency and confidence building measures. We have seen that there is increasing support amongst Member States for a pragmatic approach that encompasses all three types of measure in a complementary and mutually reinforcing way. In this regard, we have always been clear that this OEWG is an important contribution to the objective of preventing an arms race in outer space and that our work should be developed in not in competition with other relevant initiatives such as the upcoming group of governmental experts. Mr Chair, no doubt we will have further opportunities this week to pay tribute to your excellent stewardship of our working group. For now, I would like to thank you and the Secretariat for your efforts since our last meeting to summarise our work so far in your elements papers, for engaging in wide-ranging consultations and for producing a first draft of our final report. which we believe gives us a very good basis on which to work. My delegation is optimistic that we can reach a consensus document. Our hope and expectation is that it will capture in a positive way the important steps forward we have already taken along the lines that I have described. That it will fairly reflect the rich variety of concerns and ideas that delegations have put forward. and that it will set clear direction for the continuation of discussions in the United Nations on the development of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors. I will end my remarks there Mr. Chair and look forward to a constructive and fruitful week of discussions. I thank you.",1
S4M114,4,1,Japan,"Mr. Chair, at the outset, I would like to express a sincere appreciation to the Chair for his unwavering efforts, including during the intersessional period, to seek common ground in preparation for this session, which is now crystallized in the draft report before us. Japan is also happy to join the statement of the cross-regional group delivered by the We would like to reiterate Japan's full support and strong determination to contribute to a consensus report of this OEWG. Mr. Chair, from the previous discussions of the OEWG, it is clear that all States are reliant on space for the peace and prosperity, and that there is a pressing need to address space security in light of the current rapid developments. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight four points that Japan considers important to be included in the final report. First is the benefit of the behavior-based approach. Space is a domain where even innovative technologies developed with benign intention may, if used inappropriately, pose a serious threat to others due to their dual-use nature. Given the blurring distinction between military and civil space assets and services, it is crucial to focus on how a capability is used and its consequences while addressing space threats, rather than focusing solely on capabilities or objects. Such an approach is more observable and can endure future technology advancement, while not hampering development of innovative solutions to space sustainability. Japan family believes that fostering a common understanding or responsible and irresponsible behaviors regarding outer space in an inclusive manner would contribute to reducing misunderstanding and miscalculation, as well as to preventing an arms race in outer space. Second is the applicability of existing international law and norms and the relation between non-legally binding and legally binding instruments. As reaffirmed in previous sessions, existing international law, notably the Outer Space Treaty and the United Nations Charter, apply in outer space and state compliance should be reiterated. While accumulation of practices is limited in the space domain compared to other domains, we are witnessing a rapid evolution of the use of space. In this regard, common understanding fostered within this OEWG could lay the foundation for future legally binding instruments. Therefore, non-legally binding instruments and LBI's are not a dichotomy, not a trade-off, but rather complementary and mutually reinforcing. Third is shared views on threats and norms of responsible behavior. In the face of a challenge of formulating a consensus report that should reflect very informative and enriching discussions at this group, we consider there was a convergence of views on a wide range of topics, including the following four points. First, The urgency of addressing destructive behaviors that cause substantive amount of debris at such behaviors can escalate tensions and pose danger to peace and security, as well as to the sustainable use of outer space. Second, rendezvous and proximity operations are not threat parser, but can be threats when conducted in an irresponsible manner, such as operations that cause physical damage to others without prior consent and those that lack transparency. Third, reaffirmation and articulation of transparency and confidence-building measures related to outer space that can reduce misunderstanding and miscalculation. Fourth, the interest in and need to continue discussions on the threats and norms building on the work of the OEWG. Mr. Chair, Force is the value of this OEWG and the continuation of our discussions. Japan highly appreciates the inclusive dynamic and interactive approach that this OEWG has taken under your skillful guidance, which has generated genuine dialogue. pertaining to space security with the participation of various relevant stakeholders. This merits to be mentioned in the report and we support a follow-on process to deepen our discussion further. Mr. Chair, taking this opportunity, I would like to reiterate our strong condemnation of North Korea's launch using ballistic missile technology conducted on August 24, 2023, this year. Such a launch is a clear and flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, and poses a grave threat to regional and international peace and security. North Korea announced its intention to conduct another launch in October. Japan urged the DPRK not to conduct further launches using ballistic missile technology and to fully comply with all relevant UNSC resolutions. Thank you Mr Chair for your kind attention.",1
S4M116,4,1,Singapore,"Mr Chair, the delegation of Singapore would like to express our gratitude to you and the Secretary for the excellent organisation of this OEWG. We would also like to thank you for your draft consensus report which provides a useful starting point for further discussions during this session. Singapore aligns itself with the joint statement delivered by the Philippines and co-sponsored by 33 delegations, including Singapore itself. Singapore recognises the importance of outer space in providing capabilities to help tackle existential challenges like climate change and to serve important economic sectors such as aviation and maritime. As a small state, it is in our interest to support and promote a rules-based approach based on applicable international law. for the responsible use of space for all. We believe that this approach best supports the preservation of outer space as a peaceful environment for the conduct of space activities and as a global commons that remains accessible and beneficial for all humankind. Existing international law must underpin the basis of the OEWG's discussions. This includes the UN Charter, the UN Treaties on Outer Space, and customary international law as applicable. In addition, Singapore also underscores the importance of relevant General Assembly resolutions and consensus documents such as the 2013 Group of Governmental Experts' Statement on Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures in Outer Space Activities and related recommendations adopted by the UN Disarmament Commission as a basis for discussion. To advance the work of the OEWG, the meeting should strive for new areas of consensus. As a practical way forward, Singapore supports the development and adoption of norms of responsible behaviours to facilitate consensus building, without precluding the future possibility of a legally binding instrument. In this regard, efforts to reach a common view on certain issues could pave the way towards avoiding misunderstanding, miscalculation and unintended escalation in space and preserve the peaceful uses of outer space. One such issue is the creation of space debris. of which destructive anti-satellite activities are a major cause. Such space debris tends to be widely distributed and can be unpredictable, potentially colliding with and causing irreparable damage to other orbiting satellites, and exponentially increasing the likelihood of further collisions. Singapore therefore supports the cessation of destructive anti-satellite activities so as to ensure the sustainability of outer space by avoiding the creation of more debris, and the development of norms, rules and principles in this regard. Additionally, Singapore recognises that there is a need for greater transparency and better communication with regard to space activities, such as rendezvous and proximity operations – RPO. We encourage further discussions of norms, rules and principles on this matter as part of confidence-building efforts. Mr Chair, It is vital that Member States work together to reduce space threats and preserve outer space as a peaceful global commons. Singapore reaffirms its full commitment to contributing to the OEWG's work in this final session. We hope that this week's discussions will move us all towards the development of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour in outer space. We will also support an open and inclusive follow-up process to the ongoing OEWG. to continue our discussions on such vital topics.",1
S4M117,4,1,South Korea,"Mr. Chair, let me begin by reiterating my delegation's full support for your efforts to make this open-ended working group a success. With your able leadership, the OEWG process has inspired fruitful discussions on outer space security and has been a platform for forming a common understanding of space threats. We align ourselves to the joint statement delivered by the distinguished delegation from the Philippines and would also like to provide our national positions. Throughout the last three sessions, we jointly explored what could be the most effective way to reduce space to ensure a safe, secure, and sustainable space. While languages and methods may differ, all states, irrespective of their technology status, were able to reach a common understanding of the need to develop norms, rules, and principles on space security further. As my delegation presented its view throughout the last three sessions, The Republic of Korea believes that a behavior-based approach is timely, pragmatic, and realistic, and appropriate in addressing threats in outer space. In particular, our substantive report should reflect the following considerations. First, space threats should be defined based on action and behavior, rather than the capabilities themselves. This holistic and comprehensive approach is much needed in light of the dual use and dual purpose nature of our space. Second, an effective approach should entail, among other things, an appropriate set of transparency and confidence building measures, norm of behaviors, and political commitments. During the OEWG process, the RK has submitted working papers on our national position, and in the draft report, such as a multilateral pre-activity notification on space security related behaviors and a commitment to not to conduct direct ascent anti-satellite missile testings. Mr. Chair, we welcome your draft report as it well summarizes our concerns and collective will to respond to such concerns. The Republic of Korea believes that the key lies in balancing the different views and perspectives, and we stand ready to engage constructively. Mr. Chair, while all the member states and relevant stakeholders have convened here today to find the most effective way to guarantee safe, secure, and sustainable peace in space, it is truly deplorable that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been chosen to take the opposite path by launching a so-called military reconnaissance satellite using ballistic missile technology on August 24. We need to remain vigilant as the DPRK is abusing the UN treaty embodies to legitimize its illegal and prohibited launching activities, as it has done numerous times. I would like to make it clear that any launch that uses ballistic missile technology, regardless of what it carries, can contribute to further advancement of ballistic missile technology capable of delivering nuclear weapons. With each test, the DPRK is getting closer to achieving its goal. This is why the Security Council adopted many resolutions that prohibit any activity using ballistic missile technology. Its launch does not fall into the category of peaceful use of outer space, contrary to the DPRK's deceptive narrative. Therefore, we strongly condemn the DPRK for its unlawful act, which constitutes a flagrant violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. We also urge the DPRK to cease its provocations that undermine the international legal regime governing outer space. and degrade conditions for expanding international cooperation in reducing space threats. Mr. Chair, before I conclude, I would like to briefly share the Republic of Korea's recent activity on space security issues. We are glad to announce that the UNIDIRS project on space security portal and the Lexicon for Outer Space Security to support transparency, information sharing, and the capacity building will have a showcase event this Wednesday. We are happy to have supported this project financially, and we look forward to your active participation in this project. The Republic of Korea takes this opportunity to express its firm commitment to play its due role during the partner countries to ensure the success of the OEWG process, and hope that our work continues beyond these just four sessions of the OEWG walking process. Thank you.",1
S4M119,4,1,New Zealand,"Thank you Mr Chair and tena tato katoa or greetings in Te Reo Maori, New Zealand's Indigenous language to you all. As this is the first time that my delegation has taken the floor, I would like to begin by thanking you for your leadership throughout the OEWG. I assure you of New Zealand's full support and I thank the Secretariat and interpreters for their work in supporting this meeting. In addition to the joint statement delivered by the Distinguished Ambassador of the Philippines on behalf of the Friends of the OEWG, to which New Zealand aligns, I will share some remarks in my national capacity. The OEWG has clearly highlighted the importance of work on keeping the space domain stable and secure, and the criticality that states act at all times in accordance with international law. Events from last week have also highlighted the importance of this work. North Korea's launch on the 24th of August using ballistic missile technology is a clear of United Nations Security Council resolutions and threatens regional and international peace and stability. We condemn the launch in the strongest terms. Mr Chair, As a space-launching state, Aotearoa New Zealand advocates for a peaceful, sustainable, safe and secure space environment. We are encouraged by the wide engagement and the depth and breadth of discussions throughout this process. This engagement reflects a wide recognition of the importance of reducing threats in outer space. Discussions at the OEWG have highlighted many points of agreement, in particular, states have recognised the importance of the existing international law which underpins space activities. This includes the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, a wide range of treaties that govern conduct in outer space, and the law of state responsibility. In this context, context, I would like to share our particular appreciation for the ICRC's work to elaborate how IHL applies to outer space activities. As the guardians of IHL, they have a special role to play in this regard. At the same time, states have acknowledged that existing international law may not be sufficient for managing all aspects of space security into the future. The outer space environment is rapidly changing in response to technological developments and a rapid increase in the breadth of space activity. Further work is needed to ensure that international law remains effective for space activity in the 21st century. There has been wide agreement, Mr. Chair, on the irresponsibility of activities which add to the growing problem of orbital debris through the deliberate destruction of space systems. This agreement is reflected in a growing number of states that have committed to never test direct ascent anti-satellite missiles. We encourage all states to join us in making this commitment. Many states have seen value in elaborating norms of responsible behaviors as a useful and practical step towards reducing threats in outer space. This approach does not preclude the development of legally binding measures and can contribute to their development in due course. States have emphasized the importance of enhancing transparency, building confidence building, including through improved communication around space activities. This is an important way to reduce the risk of misunderstanding, misperception, and an unintended escalation in space. And finally, Mr. Chair, states have highlighted the importance of developing rules and norms around particular types of space operations, such as rendezvous operations and proximity operations, as well as to protect the provision of critical space based. services to civilians. Mr Chair, we are encouraged that these areas of agreement have been reflected in your draft report. We appreciate that there is still much to do this week before we reach a final agreement. In space, as in the multilateral context, we are at our best when we work together. In that spirit, we encourage all delegations to work together with a constructive approach towards achieving a substantive report. Thank you, Chair and distinguished delegates. We look forward to a productive session.",1
S4M121,4,1,China,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. As this is my first attendance to the meeting of this working group as ambassador of China on Disarmament Affairs, I would like to thank you and appreciate your efforts for the work of the working group. I and my delegation are willing to... continue supporting your work and we are looking forward to working with all parties to promote the efforts of the working groups as to negotiate and conclude a legal instrument on outer space arms control and early date and realize the fundamental aim of prevention of arms race in outer space. This is the final session of the working group. We always maintain that the binary distinction between responsible and irresponsible space behavior is too simplistic and subjective and can easily become a political tool. Therefore, we voted against UNG Resolution 76-231 with a mandate to establish this working group. In spite of this, we participated in all sessions of the working group with professional and constructive attitude and stated views and positions. Overall impressions that the discussions of the working group have demonstrated the common will of all parties to prevent an arms race in outer space and have also reflected deep differences of views among parties concerning various agenda items. Especially on issues such as whether being responsible can be the criterion to assess space behavior, whether international humanitarian law is applicable to outer space, what are the implications and extensions of outer space threat and how to tackle them? Some views are even against each other. In such a situation, how to comprehensively and accurately sum up common standing and objectively reflect the discussion in a balanced view remains a challenge for the working group. Mr. Chair, China carefully studied the draft distributed by the Chair on the 21st of August, and we have noted your efforts and other parties' efforts to bridge differences. We have also noted that the draft incorporated quite a number of concepts and views on which there is no common understanding. proposals that are conducive to the maintenance of space, security in outer space and conclusion and negotiation of legal instrument have not been... adequately reflected, we have the following views on the direction of the working group and of the draft before us. First, it's necessary to focus on security governance in outer space. We believe that the report of the working group should explicitly urge all parties to make the commitment to negotiate and conclude a legal instrument on arms control in outer space and make specific suggestions so as to fill the gap. of existing international law concerning arms control. This is the most fundamental way for the maintenance of security out of space. It's necessary to further clarify a reasonable relationship between responsible behavior and existing legal regime. to ensure compatibility of the report with international law to avoid a situation in which this concept confuses international legal concepts and misinterprets international law and shakes the basis for outer space security governance. Different parties have different deep differences of view on whether international law is applicable to outer space, the report should objectively reflect this. Second, it's necessary to fully respond to fundamental security threat. At present, the tendency to weaponize and make outer space a battlefield has intensified a certain country takes outer space as war fighting domain and takes offensive outer space. policies and military doctrines, this is the most urgent and most fundamental security threat to outer space at present. Discussions that avoid this fundamental threat but focus on physical form of threat and the formulation on such basis would be tantamount to the formulation of rules of engagement and this would be contrary to... the prevention of arms trades in outer space. The report should take this threat as priority and ask all parties to make the commitment not to seek hegemony and dominance in outer space and not to take outer space as warfighting domain. At the same time, mega commercial constellations are the most important reason for the increase of collision among space vehicles and they may get involved in geopolitical conflict. This should be paid attention to. It's necessary to point out that direct ascent asset test is not the major reason for space debris. The issue of space debris is being discussed within the framework of the Committee on the should adopt a prudent attitude in dealing with this matter. Third, it's necessary to increase cooperation to tackle threat. to increase capabilities to tackle threat. Exchange of views and technical cooperation in outer space and such efforts is conducive to the increase of capabilities of various countries to tackle space security threat. No country should set up. barriers against development of space technology and peaceful use of outer space of other countries on the basis of ideological bias and prejudice or its national security interest and even use domestic law. to hamper the efforts of other countries. At the same time, we believe that cooperation for space monitoring and situational awareness should adhere to the principle of common efforts to consult, build, and share, and should not be used for the development and test of space weapons. and should not serve military purposes as offensive and defensive exercises. These efforts should be reflected in the report. We believe that the core purpose for the establishment of this working group by the UNGA is to maintain peace and tranquility out of space and prepare for... the negotiation conclusion of legal instrument in the future. It is with this understanding that we have participated in the working group. We hope that all parties can make come efforts to build a community of global security and open new paths to security based on dialogue instead of confrontation, partnership instead of alliance, win-win instead of zero-sum game. And this is also the right way to resolve the issues that some delegations have mentioned as threat to outer space just now. We are willing to explore with all parties to find effective ways to tackle threat to outer space and make our contribution to the mantises of peace, security, and sustainability of outer space. My delegation is willing to exchange views and cooperate with all parties under your guidance. make efforts to negotiate and conclude comprehensive and balanced and objective report on the basis of principle of consensus. Just now in your statement, you mentioned the atmosphere, the smell of consensus in your statement. Just now in other colleagues' statements, I also detected a smell of tension. I sincerely hope that your smell of consensus will prevail in the end. Thank you, sir.",4
S4M123,4,1,Sri Lanka,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, Sri Lanka complements the work accomplished by you as the chair of this open-ended working group to date, based on the mandate given by General Assembly Resolution 76-231. We are thankful to all Member States for their constructive engagement throughout the past sessions towards reaching a substantive outcome of this working group. Mr. Chair, Sri Lanka recognizes the common interest of humankind in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes without discrimination. Sri Lanka has been actively engaging in multilateral efforts for the prevention of an arms race in outer space over many decades since becoming a signatory to the Outer Space Treaty in 1967. on the testing and development of space weapons, preceding multilateral negotiations on a treaty to prohibit all weapons in space in 1985. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has been co-presenting, together with Egypt, the UNGA First Committee resolution on prevention of an arms race in outer space in keeping with our long-standing and principled position on this subject and the promotion of peaceful uses of outer space. the Paros resolution, the current international legal regime pertaining to outer space does not in and of itself guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Today, with the rapid advancement of new space technologies, prevention of an arms race in outer space has become critical. We believe that the mandate of this working group is to make recommendations on possible which could contribute to the negotiation of a legally binding instrument. Further, we wish to highlight the necessity of effective measures for verification to prevent an arms race in outer space. Mr. Chair, Sri Lanka is of the view that the draft report should be strengthened on the need for the development of international law on space security. We also believe that the report should reflect a consensual text and reiterate Sri Lanka's position. that the early negotiation of a legally binding instrument on Paros should be a priority. An increasing number of space actors, related emerging new technologies and a fast blurring line between civilian and military users of space capacities give rise to the need to address existing legal gaps in the outer space treaty. needs to recognize the need for further advancement of international law on outer space, building on the existing legal frameworks. We welcome in this regard the recognition of the applicability of relevant treaty and customary international law to outer space activities in the draft report. Sri Lanka further wishes to underline that the norms, rules and principles developed by the Open-ended Working Group should not provide the ground for any subjective interpretation of existing legal obligations on the conduct in outer space or the possibility for generalization of outer space as a domain for possible conflict undermining the goal of PAROs. We reiterate that the working group should highlight the importance of applicability of international law regarding outer space activities. that Member States should further consider proposing possible norms, rules and principles to address mitigating outer space debris, prevention of militarization of space and protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure. We should pay extra attention to preventing irresponsible behavior which could have potential impact on international peace, security and stability as well as interrupting essential civilian services. scientific research and development, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk prediction. In keeping with growing international concerns regarding modern outer space capabilities, Sri Lanka calls for the universalization of existing international law applicable to outer space activities. It is important for our delegation that the Open-ended Working Group report reiterates the priority need for early negotiation of a comprehensive and non-discriminatory legally binding instrument on Paros. Voluntary non-binding measures, including transparency and confidence building measures, cannot and should not be a substitute for an international legally binding instrument to prevent an arms race in outer space. that the deliberations of this forum would lead to an inclusive and comprehensive consensus outcome report. I thank you.",4
S4M125,4,1,France,"Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, everybody. I shall like to begin this first statement by thanking you, Chairman, and by congratulating you for the work which you have been doing very consistently and with great determination throughout the course of this session of the Open-ended Working Group. You have put in constant effort in order to make sure that we comply with the mandate that was given to this group while being as inclusive as possible at the same time and consulting all states. You've also taken into account the expertise held by other parties. We are now coming to the conclusion of the work of this group and France would like us to have managed to reach a point where we can agree a report on consensus by this Friday. and we will contribute to that in as constructive a manner as possible. As of now, we think we can draw some conclusions and indeed some lessons from the work which has been done over the last two years. That work has indicated that this group has been a success. To begin with, it brought together an increasingly large number of states and non-state actors, and this has illustrated the fact that space security is important to everybody, not just a handful of nations. Furthermore, it has made it possible for participants to have an in-depth exchange of opinions on space threats and to agree the... essential need for all those involved in work in space to hold discussions on these issues. Thirdly, it made it possible to reiterate the applicability of international law to the space environment. It also highlighted the importance of applying confidence-building and transparency members, something which we already realized a decade ago. Last but certainly not least, it has shown that taking an approach based on responsible behaviours makes it possible to tackle a wide range of threats and breathe new life into the goal of preventing an arms race in space. On this point, Resolution 7741 shows that this approach can give specific results when it comes to space security. The OAWG and its establishment has in and of itself made a major contribution to increasing space security. Our discussions have enabled us to highlight several possible approaches to work to developing norms in the future, and I shall come back to that particular point in a later statement. We've also shown that it's essential that the work done here be continued. so that we can refine our work, be more specific about the practical and theoretical concepts involved and, in the end, develop effective norms. This is a point which we think should be duly reflected in the report. We welcome the fact that 33 countries support this same conclusion. We heard that in the joint statement which was made at the beginning of this discussion by Her Excellency the Ambassador of the Philippines. that shows that many participants in this group want to see the work here continue in the inclusive way in which it has been handled thus far, and it also shows that an increasingly large number of states and non-state parties are concerned about and informed in work done on space security. We welcome this initiative. Continuing the work is essential, therefore, if we are to come up with norms on responsible implementing the transparency and confidence building measures which we have established. Continuing with work on this also means a long-term effort which is essential for negotiating legally binding instruments over the longer term. There's no conflict between those negotiations and norms of responsible behaviour. Indeed, the latter are an essential precursor of the former. I would also like to take this opportunity, if I may, to congratulate UNIDAY on the work that they have done and which France has been supporting. The tools they've developed will be extremely useful in the continuation of our work. The space security portal is the specific... implementation of a transparency and confidence building measure, the kind that encourages states to share their strategies, their doctrines and their policies related to space security with others in a spirit of full transparency. France has contributed to this itself and through the European Union. Thank you very much, Chair.",1
S4M127,4,1,Venezuela,"Good morning. Thank you very much, Chair. It is a pleasure to see you once again. I left my post for a certain time, but now I am back following maternity leave. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to express its gratitude to you, Chair, for the way in which you have conducted our work. You can count on my delegation's full support. We would also like to thank you for your efforts to prepare the document containing possible elements. And we take note of the first draft report. Our delegation has looked very carefully at the documents you prepared, and we have also looked at the comments submitted by other delegations. We will therefore now share the views of our delegation on the draft report. Chairman, first of all, we recognize that outer space is an ever more congested and competitive domain where vital activities for humankind take place and where there are increasing peaceful uses of space such as scientific research, telecommunications, navigation and climate monitoring activities. There are also increasing concerns in this domain, such as that of the proliferation of weapons and anti-satellite systems, space debris and cybernetic threats amongst others. Against this backdrop, the Open-ended Working Group has enabled us to hold an inter-state dialogue and a dialogue with other stakeholders with a view to achieving a consensus on the rules, norms and principles aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space and on how to preserve space as a common area of humankind. During the first session of this open-ended working group, my delegation actually highlighted the urgent need of ensuring equal access without any discrimination for all nations to the use of outer space on the basis of international cooperation. in areas such as scientific research and the transfer of technologies. We also reaffirmed the need to maintain outer space free from dangers, a sustainable outer space, and to prevent that area from becoming a theatre of war. In this context, my delegation is a party to a plethora of treaties aimed at ensuring transparency, precaution, cooperation and coordination in space activities, and also aimed at preventing any action that might generate risks or interferences in other space users' activities. Moreover, it is clear for my delegation that those activities which are not of a military purpose, such as international cooperation for peaceful uses of outer space, as well as the study of space-related activities and research programs and investments into space exploration. These all are matters that actually fall within the mandate of the Committee on the Peaceful This has been clearly detailed by the document presented by the distinguished delegation of the Russian Federation. Secondly, we believe that it is necessary to recall the following. On the sidelines of the work of this group, some states have expressed their interest or intention of developing space military capabilities. This could pose a threat for space, peace, and security. The most obvious example is the announcement of the creation of the U.S. Space Forces as an independent branch of the U.S. Armed Forces with a view to protecting the U.S.' national and freedom of action in outer space. This has led to a number of tests of a anti-satellite wetmephans, both from Earth and in other areas. My delegation repeatedly argued that states' efforts should be geared towards preventing an arms race in outer space and preventing the placement of weapons in space. This requires negotiations on a legally binding instrument that is comprehensive and non-discriminatory in nature to ensure the full and effective prevention of an arms race in outer space. Given that the voluntary initiatives, including confidence-building measures, can provide a partial contribution to reducing distrust and improving the situation, that is worth noting. But they are strictly voluntary and complementary, and they cannot act as a substitute for a more official the non-first placement of weapons. And that has been the position of the non-aligned states. My delegation expressed its concerns regarding the notions of responsible behavior and the elements that are contained within that vague notion, which is not a legal notion, and which could be interpreted. along the lines of there being acceptable behaviors or legitimate or licit behaviors in the field of war or conflict in outer space. And we believe that such an interpretation would run counter to the principles of international law as they currently stand and as they are meant to ensure the peaceful use and exploration of outer space. are intrinsically subjective in nature and fuzzy. Therefore, they are not sufficient for preventing potential harm. This was stated in the document presented by the Islamic Republic of Iran. These comments were made by my delegation during the Open-ended Working Group's previous sessions. However, we believe that they are not duly reflected in the draft report that has been prepared. Chairman. Taking into account the purpose of this fourth session, my delegation would like to make the following concrete recommendations for the draft report. First of all, the threats reduction and notion of responsible behavior are not sufficient. Recognizing that space is part of the common heritage of mankind and that exploration and use should take place. exclusively for peaceful purposes in full respect of applicable international law, currently requires the establishment of measures aimed at preserving outer space as an area free from art conflict. And we need to also ensure strategic stability and there is a need for effective and legally binding measures to prevent an arms race in outer space and also to reduce build trust between space actors. Secondly There are in the field of space exploration peaceful activities, but there's also a need for there to be concrete rules aimed at preventing the placement and use of weapons in space, including, of course, weapons of mass destruction. Thirdly, with a view to preventing the extension of deterrence, doctrines which tend to be precursors to arms races, preventing the exception of those to outer space, it is also necessary to have a prohibition on efforts to pursue supremacy in outer space or efforts aimed at achieving strategic advantages in outer space. Fourthly, we should also clearly prohibit the creation and deployment of technologies, obstacles and illegal restrictions in the form of unilateral coercive measures, which are aimed at impeding or obstructing the space activities of other states with peaceful purposes, in particular those of developing states. Fifthly, the draft treaty prepared by Russia and China on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space. and on the use or threat of use of force against space objects should be given due consideration by all states and it could serve as a basis for beginning negotiations within the conference on disarmament. My delegation hopes that these considerations will be reflected in the draft report and to conclude I would like to reiterate my delegation's full support for bringing our work to a successful conclusion. conclusion. Thank you.",4
S4M129,4,1,Italy,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. At the outset, let me congratulate you on your skillful and patient work in steering us to this last session of the open-ended working group. We look forward to further substantive discussions and the approval of the report by the end of this week. Italy fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union and the statement delivered by the Philippines on behalf of our cross-regional group of states. which shows the high degree of convergence we have reached within this working group. We fully believe that the OEWG has already provided a valuable contribution to our common goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. We regard security in space as a multisectoral and global issue that requires the engagement of not just UN member states but also of international organizations, commercial actors and civil This is why we appreciate the OEWG's inclusive and multi-stakeholder approach. This has allowed inclusive and cross-cutting dialogue and made a useful contribution to our common goal of achieving a common understanding of how best to act to reduce threats to space systems in order to maintain outer space as a peaceful, secure, stable and sustainable environment free from an arms race and conflict. the benefit of all. Mr Chair, we welcome your draft report and are convinced that it represents a solid basis for the work ahead of us. Please allow me to highlight some key points that are important to us. As we said many times, to address the complexity of space risks and threats one must first protect the integrity of the existing legal framework. It is therefore the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter on international humanitarian law, to the exploration and use of outer space. The report should recognize the importance of the United Nations Treaties on Outer Space and reaffirm that all principles enshrined in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty are applicable. The widest possible adherence to existing international instruments on the peaceful exploration and use of outer space must be promoted. The report should also reflect the extensive and useful discussions we had on current and future threats by States to space systems and actions, activities and missions that could be considered irresponsible. considered particularly urgent, such as the persistent development or testing of anti-satellite missiles. Such activities are of great concern because they create long-lasting debris clouds compromising the security of outer space activities. Italy has committed not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests following the adoption in New York in December 2022 of UN General Assembly Resolution 77-41. This decision is part of Italy's strong commitment to ensuring security in outer space. Mr Chair, we also believe that the report should make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours relating to threats by States to space systems. We take note of the views expressed by some delegations that these norms cannot be a substitute for a legally binding instrument on Paris. We are aware that positions diverge on whether or not we need a legally binding instrument. Yet, notwithstanding those differences, the report should properly reflect the key relevance of continuing to work on the development of these norms to increase security in outer space. Norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours can indeed complement the existing legal framework governing space activities. In addition, as has been said, has often been the case in the history of conventional international law, they can serve as non-binding tools for the gradual evolution of international law. They can in fact be an important intermediate step in maximizing the chances of a successful outcome of future negotiations on a binding treaty. We're also convinced that the reports should reflect the importance of transparency and confidence-building measures We fully believe that a crucial step towards achieving greater security in outer space is represented by the effective implementation of transparency and confidence measures, including those identified by the Group of Governmental Experts in 2013 endorsed by the UN General Assembly. In this regard, we consider that the report should contain a specific reference to the hate code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation. Mr Chair, we deeply value the substantive work conducted so far and we consider that the Open-ended Working Group has played an important role in finding converging views on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours. We would like the report to emphasise the effectiveness and usefulness of the cooperative and comprehensive approach undertaken within the OEWG. Rest assured of my delegation's full support and cooperation throughout this week. We are ready to work with you and other delegations in a constructive way for a consensual outcome. I thank you Mr. Chair.",1
S4M131,4,1,Canada,"leadership throughout this OEWG process. You have demonstrated a strong commitment to ensuring a successful outcome for this group and I can assure you of the full support of my delegation as we enter this final and critical week. We would like to note our alignment with the statement delivered by the Ambassador of the Philippines on behalf of the group of friends of the OEWG and we were pleased to join with a cross-regional group of states expressing support for the working group. We would also like to join others in condemning the DPRK for its recent and failed launch using ballistic missile technology as prohibited under United Nations Security Council resolutions. Mr. Chair, the imperative of maintaining security in the space domain has never been so clear, and the widespread participation and enthusiasm that we have seen from Member States over the last three sessions has demonstrated a growing recognition of this imperative. We would particularly like to note our appreciation of the openness and inclusivity of this OEWG process. We think it has been a great benefit that all states, regardless of their level of development, are able to participate. We also appreciate the inclusion of civil society, as the role of private sector actors in space will continue to increase, and as societies become more and more dependent on space systems for many facets of our daily lives. It is crucially important that we incorporate and consider these perspectives. The work of the OEWG has done much to advance awareness of the applicability of international law, including international humanitarian law, to outer space, to broaden understanding of the range of threats to space systems, and propose norms, rules, and principles to reduce misunderstandings and miscalculations in space. Our task for this week is to agree to a consensus report that addresses the mandate we have been given. The first draft you have produced is a solid basis from which we can begin our discussions, and we believe there is much in there that we can agree upon. Some of the recommendations contained in your draft report represent significant progress towards improving space security, and more importantly, provide the basis upon which further work can proceed. possibly culminating in one or more legally binding instruments in the future. We note in particular the recommendation to refrain from destructive direct-descent anti-satellite missile tests. As this behavior has already garnered the support of the United Nations General Assembly, we can see the development of a norm that is gathering broad consensus and could form the beginning of new international space law. However, one element we feel is missing from the report is an acknowledgement of the very real impact that insecurity in space has on communities here on Earth. Resilience to harm is less equal across societies, and these impacts can be felt disproportionately based on gender, race, sexuality, geography, and socioeconomic status. In the final report, Canada would like to see an acknowledgement of this disproportionate and recognition of the need to include perspectives and recommendations that are gender-informed and inclusive. My delegation has developed a short paragraph that could be added to the report and which we would be pleased to submit to you for the working group's consideration. We look forward to providing additional comments on the report throughout the week. Mr. Chair, although the OEWG is coming to an end, our work is far from over. In November of this year, the group of governmental experts will begin its examination on substantial elements of a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. It is important that we view these processes as not in competition to each other, but complementary. It is not a choice between norms of responsible behavior and legally binding instruments. Both can exist. Both have a role in helping to achieve the objective of reducing space threats. and both can contribute to the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Indeed, as we have emphasized at many points throughout these working group sessions, one process can help pave the way for the other. Once we have an established body of norms that state support and follow, it becomes a far easier task to codify this into legally binding instruments. Once again, Chair, Canada applauds your leadership of this process and we look forward to working constructively with all delegations to reach a successful conclusion to this OEWG. Thank you for your attention.",1
S4M133,4,1,Israel,"Chairperson, Israel would like to thank you, your team, and the Secretariat for all of your efforts to reach a common ground and achieve a substantial final report by consensus. We would like to extend our congratulations to India and the Indian Space Research Organization for the successful landing of the Chandrayaan-3 mission on the south pole of the moon. We are looking forward to the findings of the scientific mission as its success is the success of all humanity. As we begin the last formal session of the Working Group and prepare for the discussion on the final report, please allow us to make a few general comments. Israel attaches great value to the Working Group and recognizes its value as a forum that promotes a greater understanding on various aspects of reduction of space threats during peacetime, and a forum which includes many relevant actors. We believe it is important to base the final report upon conclusions reached by consensus reflecting the deliberations held by this group. We note that there seems to be wide agreement on certain notions, such as the notion that international law applies to activities in outer space, the importance of promoting international cooperation and trust-building measures, as well as regarding the importance of information sharing and de-escalation mechanisms. We think it's important that the report encapsulates these widely shared insights. There is, however, disagreement regarding other issues. In this regard, among them, Article 36 of the draft report lists numerous proposals for possible norms, rules, and principles, many of which are highly controversial and widely contested. Israel, along with other states, has concerns regarding many of these proposals. and generally maintains that it would be inappropriate and premature to include them in the final report. While Israel sees merit in states considering further proposal for norms, the list of recommendations stipulated in the draft has not been sufficiently discussed by the working group and requires further analysis. Mr. Chair, we would like also to reiterate Israel's view that existing international law applies to state activity in outer space and provides a sufficient legal framework to address such activity. Israel would like to highlight the importance of the final report reflecting this legal situation, as well as reflecting that the report's conclusions and recommendations are without prejudice to existing international law. Israel also has specific comments regarding the proposed text of the report, which will be presented further on in discussions. We would like to extend our gratitude once again to you, Chair, for the leadership you have displayed throughout the open-ended working group process. Israel hopes that the final report will fully acknowledge the complexity of the issue at hand and the need for a thorough, gradual, and meticulous process that builds a stable foundation for the continuation of the conversation on this subject. This will allow the members of the group to address any suggestions for possible norms with a responsible and prudent approach. I thank you Mr. Chairperson and I wish us all a fruitful week.",1
S4M135,4,1,Sweden,"Mr. Chair, and first of all, I want to add my delegation's voice to those that have already thanked you and the Secretariat for all your work and dedication to ensure that the OEWG is inclusive, substantive, and conducive to progress. I also want to thank you, Chair, for your draft report, which will serve as a good basis for our work this week. Sweden fully aligns itself with the statement made by the representative of the European Union. We're also one of the 33 states that align with the joint statement in support of the OAWG delivered by the distinguished ambassador of the Philippines. This statement very well captures the strength of this process and the expectations for the work ahead of us. And I simply want to add a few points in my national capacity. Sweden believes that the OAWG, which we are fully supportive of, is a pragmatic and constructive step in building common understanding on what constitutes responsible and irresponsible behavior in outer space and how various aspects on this can be addressed. Developments in and with regard to outer space are rapid and they happen here and now. Agreeing on norms of responsible behavior, therefore to our mind, constitutes the best way forward at this moment. without excluding the possibility of future legally binding instruments. In addition to norms, transparency and confidence-building measures are important as they contribute to security, reduce threats, increase predictability, and so on. And in that vein, I would like to mention that the Swedish government, to address challenges and opportunities that space entail, has initiated the process of developing a defense and security strategy for space. This strategy will describe our strategic goals and priorities, taking into account the EU space strategy for security and defense and our future membership of NATO. In addition to laying out our policies, the publication of this strategy will in itself be a transparency and confidence building measure, thus contributing to security in space. As mentioned already by the representative of the European Union, all 27 members of the EU, including Sweden, have made commitments not to conduct destructive, direct ascent, anti-satellite missile tests. We believe this to be a very important step, sending a signal of our clear commitments to outer space security and serving as a confidence building measure. As for the work ahead of us. The joint statement delivered by this distinguished colleague from the Philippines urged all participating delegations to show flexibility and to work constructively towards the adoption of a consensus report. We believe that the report should be clear in affirming that international law, including the UN Charter as well as international humanitarian law, is applicable to outer space. For Sweden, it is important that we, in our endeavors to find common ground, do not undermine or dilute existing international law. Furthermore, Sweden believes that the report should include recommendations on possible norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior, whether it is a convergence of views and positions. And the joint statement delivered earlier by the Philippines mentions some thematic areas where consensus could be found. So I will not repeat them here. It is of importance that the work that we have been doing in the OEWG can continue. We have made great progress and there are many areas of convergence, but also many issues still to discuss. We believe that the report should reflect this and offer a path for how our endeavors can be further taken forward. And the discussions within this group have indeed been interesting and fruitful, engaging and interactive. They have been enriched by the participation of various actors. demonstrating the added value of a multi-stakeholder approach. And I would like to take this opportunity to in particular thank the ICRC for its participation and invaluable contributions to the work of the group. The report of the group should acknowledge the usefulness and value added of a multi-stakeholder inclusive approach. And the work that we are conducting here will contribute not only to fostering common understandings of threats, policies, views on norms, et cetera. but also complement other processes that strive to contribute to outer space security. My delegation is committed to contribute during this week and look forward to work together with you and all other delegations. Thank you very much.",1
S4M137,4,1,Switzerland,"Thank you, Chairman. Switzerland speaking straight after Sweden may have caused a certain amount of confusion. It sometimes does, but I do hope people will know who made which statement. Chairman. We should like to begin by thanking you for your indefatigable efforts to chair this working group since it was set up, and also thank you for the inclusive and transparent manner in which you have been discharging your responsibilities. We should also like to extend our gratitude to the Secretariat for the various types of support it has given to our work. You may expect to have our full support throughout the week of last week of the session of this group. We welcome the joint trans-regional statement made by the Ambassador of the Philippines on behalf of 33 member states of whom Switzerland has won. This statement emphasized that there is a sizable number of states from various regions of the world whose points of view are getting gradually closer together on key elements of our discussions. We believe that this is a promising development for our work this week and we hope that it will contribute to our work having a successful outcome. Having said that, I should like to make a further few comments in our national capacity. First of all, and as we are getting close to the concluding moments of the work of our Open-ended Working Group, I should like to welcome the interest that the work gave rise to among Member States and the quality of the exchanges that have been a feature of these sessions. that it can, as a dedicated process open to all parties, add considerable added value when it comes to reducing space threats. Our discussions have made it easier for us to reach joint understanding on the nature of space security threats and the impact of those threats on space security. sustainability and safety in space over the long term, including for those using space for civilian and peaceful reasons. Our work has also shown the development of norms, rules and principles on responsible behaviours is necessary and is an additional approach to other efforts being made on disarmament. It emphasizes the complementarity between our work and work done elsewhere. And these are considerations which we think should be emphasized in the group's report. Secondly, we should like to thank you for the zero draft of the final report which you have submitted for our consideration. Generally speaking, it seems to reflect the discussions that the group has held. We consider that this. draft final report is a solid basis for the rest of our discussions this week. The draft report is, generally speaking, complete, and that means that we have a foundation for common understanding of the problem which we are here to discuss. That agreed foundation is essential because we are tackling certain subject matters for the first time. The report also strives to reach compromise there where we know that points of view are not necessarily moving closer together. Lastly, it includes a series of recommendations which are essential given the mandate that our group received and which will help it to contribute to the strengthening of space security. I do not wish to get too much into detail or to repeat what has already been highlighted in the joint statement made by the Philippines, but we would like to raise the following points in respect of the report because we consider them to be particularly important. We welcome the fact that the draft report reiterates that international law, including the United Nations Charter, is applicable to all activities engaged in outer space. The respective international law in space is an essential aspect of responsible behaviour. On this point, I should like to reiterate our unshaped conviction that international humanitarian law applies to all armed conflicts, whether they be international or not, and whether they take place on Earth, in the air above Earth, or in space. We should also like to welcome the fact that the draft report clearly tackles the issue of tests and the potential use of anti-satellite capacity which may have destructive effects. And that also in its recommendations. This is a problem which has already given rise to considerable concern and our group might be able to at least start by providing a response to those concerns. Navigation, communication and Earth observation satellites in particular play an essential role in the smooth operation of critical civilian infrastructure. The fact that the draft report underscores this point and furthermore recommends that no action should be taken, which might have as an effect the interruption of these services which are essential to the civilian population, seems to us to be an important and essential step forward. I have only made a few preliminary comments in this statement, and we shall make some more specific comments about the report when we start to go through it in detail. Before concluding, however, there is one final point that I should like to raise. Exchanges in this group have not only been useful and productive in general, they have also underscored the fact that we have many questions to which we still have not found answers and that a great deal remains to be done if we are to draw up these norms, rules and principles on responsible behaviour in space. Quite a few of the elements contained in the draft report make this clear both implicitly and explicitly. This being the case, it seems to us to be both important and appropriate. that this working group continue its work in the future on the basis of a renewed and more focused mandate. It would also seem suitable to us that this consideration be made in the report of this group and this session to the General Assembly. Thank you, Chairman.",1
S4M139,4,1,Iran,"Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Let us first welcome you back to the chair for the fourth and last meeting of this OEWG, in which the report of the group should be finalized by consensus. We sincerely thank you and the Secretariat for preparing of this last session, including preparation of the different documents at hand. Mr. Chairman, we have reviewed your documents on possible elements of the OEWG final report, including the latest as your draft final report of the OEWG as contained in A-AC 294 CRP-1. We expected that this conversion of the consolidated elements to the CRP would happen at later so as to a discussion on the consolidated element paper would saturate by the OEWG. So we would like that the chair would clarify how he would proceed with this CRP as it didn't take into account the entire range of issues related to security of space. Of course, we are very pleased. just from the beginning of your statement that you have given the explanation that this CRP is considered as zero draft for consideration of the OEWG. Mr. Chairman, we are compelled to reiterate that the text of CRP is yet unbalanced and does not take into account the views and comments of all members of the OEWG addressed in previous meetings. It does not specify how possible recommendations of the report would contribute to the negotiation of long awaited legally binding instrument for Paros. The CRP in its first part has touched upon international space law, but has given specific interpretations of some specific provisions of the OST 9067, for example, application of due regard that is quite new and has been recently addressed by legal experts. Furthermore, the issue such as the compatibility of space law with aviation law or law of the sea or other areas that due to the complexity of the outer space require careful consideration and the views of expressing the CRP yet to be further addressed. For example, as you are aware, Mr. Chairman, the delimitation of the air vis-a-vis space is yet a challenging issue in the cupus without any result. And then how can we determine the compatibility of the issues of space with aviation law here? Some views were also expressed by panelists that are respected but are not agreed by consensus but are reflected as the consideration of the OEWG. Mr. Chair. Other technical issues like definition of risks, hazards, and their relations with threats to space, or the issue of IHL are the ones that require further and very delicate detailed discussion, mostly in the context of negotiation of legal instrument. In particular, such specific technical terms required to be defined as terminology or definition or criteria in the context of the legal binding. document. On the issue of criteria for determining the threats, what constitutes responsible behavior, the view of my delegation and other delegation are well known. In the CRP, as the view of some delegation reflected as concrete, the view of those against behavioral approach has been expressed as a view expressed. We have to reiterate the issue of determining threats in a space in terms of responsible or irresponsible behavior is subjective matter and prone to political adversarial judgments that upon which some countries may evade their own commitments and put blame on others. Behavioral approach and its relation with actions and activities in a space does not properly address the threats to space security as we have stated in our recent submission, particularly they are oxymoron with warranted political side effects. Mr. Chair, regarding the various actions, activities or omission in relation with the space threats, we believe that enlisted activities are not exhaustive and they should define and elaborate it further. For our part, we think some new emerging threats, like threats to sovereign rights of states, such as threats from unauthorized mega constellation activities like internet services, as intervening in internal affairs of states, and military activities of such mega constellation should be addressed as new emerging threats to space. Another emerging threat is the colonization and exclusive use of space resources by private technology owners, which could result in deceptive practices related to resource extraction, resource conquest, and ultimately resource-related conflicts. Space resource extraction on a large scale and their transportation to Earth. would also lead to damage to a space environment as well as it would contribute to production of space debris, which all poses serious threats to satellite and space at large. Indiscriminate increase in space debris would jeopardize space exploration for future generations. Mr. Chairman, on recommendations part of the CRP-1, we still believe that this part requires Further consideration in particular on cooperation portion, we are very keen to add our previous principle position regarding the provisions that states should not obstruct states' development of space technology for peaceful use of outer space due to ideological bias, national security interests, or imposing illegal unilateral sanctions to other states involving domestic laws. This was reflected in the first element paper in 6C, but it has been deleted in CRP1. Finally, Mr. Chair, depending on how you would conduct the deliberation on this CRP, we are very ready to work with you to submit our proposed package of amendments and additions and deletions to this CRP to make it more streamlined as you wish. We have to... reiterate that this CRP, up to still now, is far from emerging consensus to become the final report. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.",4
S4M141,4,1,India,"Thank you Mr. President. Let me begin by acknowledging your work and that of your team in steering this process. My delegation assures you of its full support. India appreciates your inter-sessional consultations and the circulation of your proposal as a basis for the draft report. The draft report in its current shape is ambitious and requires further substantive discussion if we are to have a consensus outcome. Mr. President, India is a space-faring nation. We have a well-developed space program with development and security dimensions. An Indian spacecraft landed on the moon last week. An Indian rover, even as we meet, is exploring the moon. I would like to take this opportunity to convey to this group that India believes that outer space belongs to all of us. We are one Earth, one family and have one future. We reach for the moon and beyond in peace. We wish nothing but peace to those who travel with us and for those who will come after us. I thank my friend from Israel, a country with which we have excellent bilateral relations for its congratulations. Mr. President, India's views on the OEWG process are recorded in the explanation of vote to UNGA resolution 76 slash 231. India has nevertheless participated in this process constructively. The elements of our position have been repeated at every session of this OEWG. India believes that priority should be accorded to developing uniform interpretations and understandings of the provisions of the existing legal treaties relating to outer space. This includes developing common understandings of terms such as due regard, harmful interference, peaceful purposes amongst others. These must be developed in appropriate platforms including this. We believe that increased clarity on existing legal frameworks will contribute to reducing misperceptions or misinterpretations in outer space. We would like to reiterate our preference for a legally binding instrument on preventing arms race in outer space. India is open to the development of universal and non-discriminatory, non-binding norms and transparency and confidence building measures, as they can be complementary to a legally binding instrument. We believe, however, that they are not a substitute for legally binding instruments. India has concerns about subjectivity in the assessment and interpretation of space behaviors and perception of threats. We are concerned as to who makes these assessments, about how they are made and about the application of such determinations. India has concerns about verifications of space behavior using current technology and the access to relevant information and data. My delegation believes that threats to safety, security and sustainability of outer space must be considered comprehensively. A selective focus on certain space threats over others may impact the process of developing consensus. Our discussions in this body must consider the substantial body of work and discussions that have taken place on enhancing outer space safety, security and sustainability in relevant forums. In this context, we believe that the overlaps and the creation of multiple standards on the same set of issues should be avoided. India as a developing country believes that the outcomes of any space security related process including this OEWG should not discourage the exchange of scientific and technological research and development for peaceful and legitimate purposes. Mr. President, my delegation has sent a number of language proposals that reflect some of our major concerns. We acknowledge with appreciation that several of these find mention in your draft report. Mr. President, you have a difficult job. The Working Group deals with very important issues in a rapidly changing technological and scientific landscape. Major differences in opinion exist. This is a working group of the General Assembly and its report must accurately reflect the consensus view where there is one. It must also reflect the diversity of sentiments and view where there is none. My delegation will continue to participate in a constructive spirit. In that spirit we request that some of our concerns and matters of importance to our delegation that we do not see in your draft and which we have consistently articulated be included. My delegation believes that the link between safety and sustainability of outer space on the one hand and security on the other is not clearly established. This is a matter that requires further discussion. My delegation also has specific concerns. about the language concerning the categorization of certain acts, including but not limited to direct-accent ASAC testing. As a major space-faring nation, India is affected by debris in outer space. We have proposed specific language which we believe records our concerns and brings balance to the report. Mr. President, we have a number of other concerns which we will articulate during the course of discussions. Let me conclude by reiterating our fullest support to you and our desire to engage constructively and substantively in these proceedings. Thank you.",1
S4M142,4,1,Hungary,"Thank you Mr. Chair, distinguished delegates. Since this is the first time that Hungary takes the floor, the Hungarian delegation would like to congratulate you for presiding over this session of the Open-ended Working Group. I am confident that with your leadership we will have a very successful session and I want to confirm the full support of the Hungarian delegation to your endeavors in achieving our common goals. While we fully align with the statement of the European Union, allow me to make the following remarks in national capacity. Hungary firmly believes that the Open-ended Working Group's valuable work established by the resolution 76-231 on reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors is just the beginning of an expanding dialogue on a safe and secure outer space. We remain supportive of such efforts. In light of the rapid evolution of technology and the related space economy, it is imperative to enhance the dialogue among member states. Space is accessible to practically all states, and now also to a growing number of non-state actors. Meanwhile, the freedom of our action, our security, our economies, the daily running of our societies depend on the safe, secure, and autonomous access to space. Our dependence on space systems and services is increasing. We are more vulnerable to irresponsible and threatening behavior. Certain actions have made outer space to become a contested domain. In this new space age, transparent space activities are of strategic importance. Mr. Chair, distinguished delegates, Hungary, together with its EU partners and NATO allies, strongly advocates for responsible behavior in outer space. Strengthening the safety, security, sustainability and peaceful nature of outer space activities remains a key priority. and it is the common interest of present and future generations. Therefore, we join our voice in calling for a comprehensive approach in addressing the challenges, risks, and threats to the peaceful use of outer space in compliance with international law. This notion is a basic principle of the Hungarian National Space Strategy. Hungary has never conducted space activities threatening the operation of other space assets States in outer space. In light of the 75 years of Hungarian space heritage and to further our commitment in the peaceful, transparent and responsible use of outer space, Hungary is committed not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests. Mr. Chairman, allow me to wish you and everyone an interesting and fruitful session and good luck with your endeavors.",4
S4M144,4,1,Russia,"Thank you very much, Chairman. We would like to express the certainty that your skilled leadership will help the open-ended working group to reach consensus on an outcome document and make a contribution to preventing an arms race in space. You may count on the support and the cooperation of the delegation of the Russian Federation. We are now coming to the final part of our work in preparing a final document for this committee. And that is a document that needs to be balanced, a document that needs to be based on consensus. We are disappointed that the position of the Russian Federation does definitely not seem to be sufficiently reflected in the draft document. Therefore, we should like to reiterate one or two of our approaches of principle to preventing an arms race in space, which we believe do need to be reflected in the outcome document of this group. The Russian Federation is consistently in favor of maintaining space as an area for exclusively peaceful activities by all states on an equal basis, as well as ensuring this goal rather can only be achieved through developing generally recognized and legally binding principles and norms of international law, which would be... comprehensive and aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space. The topic of preventing space from turning into a launch pad for aggression and war, which would of course be something that is fully possible. which would take on very real features. Confirmation of this is the carrying out by certain activities of policies aimed at placing weapons in space and using outer space for carrying out military activities. with a view to ensuring their domination and supremacy. There are large-scale programs aimed at developing weapon systems which are designed to use force or the threat of force in space and from space or vis-a-vis space. Such activities have a very negative impact on international peace and security, and they are fraught with the risk of destabilizing the situation and encouraging an arms race in outer space. This would fully undermine the prospects limiting and reducing arms in general. We call for an end to the efforts to position space as a new arena for rivalry and conflict between states. Instead, the U. N member states should focus on adopting at the national and also international levels obligations to fully exclude outer space from sphere of an arms race and to preserve it for peaceful purposes for the well-being of all humankind. In particular we are talking about the fact that in outer space including in near-earth orbit and on celestial bodies there should not be any weapons placed weapons of any kind and also the use of force or threat thereof should be prohibited regarding space objects and their use. There should be a comprehensive ban on strikes aimed at destroying space objects. Specifically, such an approach allows for the adoption by UN member states the following obligations which we have repeatedly spoken about during the work of these groups. Specifically, to not use space objects as a means for striking any target on Earth, in the atmosphere or in space. To not create or test or deploy weapons in outer space for any purpose, including for as an anti-satellite means. for the use against earth-based targets or targets in the atmosphere, and also to eradicate the already existing systems that states might have. To not create, test, or deploy, or use space weapons for anti-missile defense, as anti-satellite means. or for use against Earth or the atmosphere. To not destroy, harm, or disrupt the normal functioning or change the spaceflight trajectory of space objects of other states. To not encourage or assist other states or groups of states, or indeed any non-governmental organizations, including legal persons and... those that are registered or who are placed within the territory under the jurisdiction of a state or under their control, organizations to not encourage them to do any such activities. A reliable guarantee. The guarantees for preserving space free from weapons are not reliable as they are enshrined in the legally binding treaties on the prevention of an armed space in outer space. And addressing the questions of a peaceful use of outer space and ensuring space activities cannot be. cannot be promising. They will be completely pointless. The basis for these instruments should be the Russian and Chinese proposal on preventing the placement of weapons in outer space, the use of force, or the threat of force regarding space objects. In light of the priorities of the tasks to prevent an arms race in outer space, we would like to warn the working group against focusing on issues that are not relevant to the First Committee of the General Assembly regarding the regulation of outer space. We would like to draw attention to the fact that a whole range of resolutions, including topics contained in Resolution 76-231, including that of space debris, Many topics which were included in the draft report are already being discussed by COPUS. ignoring the mandate of Kropius is not acceptable as this threatens to undermine the key role of the committee in discussing the space agenda as enshrined in General Assembly decisions. And we hope that the current Chair on the Chair of the United Arab Emirates will point to this in their statement. We believe that any measures of transparency and strengthening confidence in space activities should be aimed at a full prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space and the use of force or threat thereof regarding space objects or with their help. And these cannot substitute effective measures to prevent an arms race in outer space. They can merely complement them. In order to support international peace and ensure equal and indivisible security for all, as well as in order to raise the predictability and sustainability of space, states activities regarding the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. international measures that are and political obligations about the non-first placement in of weapons in space are absolutely essential. The full format of these initiatives include more than 30 members of the United Nations. The Russian Federation counts on the achievement by this open-ended working group of results that will foster the implementation of the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. on developing a relevant multilateral legally binding instrument containing the guarantees for preventing the placement of weapons in outer space and the use of force or threat thereof regarding space objects. We hope that this working group will also lay a sound substantive basis. for the activities of the group of governmental experts on prevention and arms race in outer space, the creation of which was supported by an overwhelming majority of UN member states and which will start working this very year. agreeing on fragmented rules of behaviour which do not take into account the approach of all UN member states and which are aimed at ensuring domination of a small handful of states in outer space and not at resolving key tasks relating to the prevention of an armistice in outer space will not allow for ensuring international peace and security. They will lead to an escalation of tensions in outer space. and they will also further drive apart the international community and also they will limit equal access to space for research and for its use for peaceful purposes. The adoption of such measures without a universal legal regime enshrined in international treaties on preventing an arms race in outer space is fraught with the most serious negative consequences for the maintenance of... space free from weapons as well as for disarmament and international security in general. As regards the continuation of the work of this open-ended working group in the future, which many states have mentioned, well at this stage we would like to refrain from emitting any premature judgments or speculation on this count. As we say, In the Russian Federation there is a saying... that the result should be judged only after the work has been done. We therefore believe it would be premature to decide what the outcome of this work should be and we believe we should focus on the preparation of the draft report and also following the results of that work to determine what negotiations format would be relevant for continuing to discuss this topic with a view to swiftly developing and signing a legally binding document. This is particularly relevant right now, bearing in mind the fact that a whole range of states continue to harbour lots of doubts about the added value of the very notion of responsible behaviour. We have heard this during this morning's session. To conclude, we would like to express our disappointment that a whole group of states at this highly expert level within this group, developed a politicized campaign against the DPRK. We consider these actions and these statements to be harmful and very cynical and hypocritical, a hypocritical attempt by the U.S. and its allies to exert pressure on the DPRK and to distract from the escalatory activities of the U.S. and its allies in that region, which are themselves a genuine threat to international peace and security. Moreover, we believe that such a politicization of the activities and work of this working group, especially at the final stages of its work, will not lead to any good. nor will it help narrow positions between states, and nor will it only create additional politicised and artificial obstacles to achieving consensus regarding the outcome document. We hope that these states will return to common sense and refrain from making such politicized views public in the future. Thank you.",4
S4M12,4,2,Malaysia,"Thank you, Mr Chair. At the outset, allow me to express my delegation's appreciation to you for steering the work of the OEWG since its first session. Malaysia assures you of our full support and cooperation. Malaysia holds the view that outer space and other celestial bodies are the common heritage of humankind. Outer space must be used, explored and utilised for peaceful purposes only, and shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries. in respect of their degree of economic and scientific development. As a responsible space actor, Malaysia remains committed to support the international legal framework in ensuring the peaceful exploration and useful use of the outer space. Mr Chair, Malaysia believes that there is an urgent need to address the serious concern raised by various states regarding possible militarization of outer space. Malaysia also believes that we need to address how to avoid behaviour that can be construed as threats as well as to mitigate accidents, miscommunication or lack of transparency which could lead to miscalculations and escalation of tensions and arms race. Malaysia echoes the legitimate concerns that existing legal instruments are inadequate to meet the needs of today's spacefaring and space reliance communities. Therefore, we believe there is a need to consolidate, reinforce and enhance the existing legislation by immediately commencing the negotiation of a legally binding instrument for the prevention of an arms race in outer space, Paros. Malaysia recognizes that there have been efforts in this regard in the past. However, due to diplomatic hurdles, such efforts have not been able to reach consensus amongst the international community. In light of this, Malaysia took the position to support the mandate of this OEWG through the UN General Assembly Resolution A-Aria-76-231, with the view that the OEWG will contribute to elaboration of a legally binding instrument on Paros in the future. We share the view that any voluntary and non-legally binding measure cannot be substituted to a legally binding treaty on Paros. Malaysia welcomes the draft report that has been circulated and believes that it is important for the OEWG to consider the following. First, to ensure that the overall process of the OEWG is transparent and inclusive. Second, even though States may have diverging views on some issues, it is vital to ensure that this initiative receives consensual support from all Member States, particularly the major players in outer space. the effectiveness of this initiative will be limited. Third, in relation to the elements under the norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours, we underscore that all norms, rules and principles to be outlined by this group must respect the principle of ensuring that outer space is used, explored and utilised for peaceful purposes only, and shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries. irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development. Any forms of weapons and activities that threatens the peaceful, safe, stability, security and sustainable environment of outer space must be prohibited. Fourth, while the established space actors may have diverse and in-depth knowledge and experience in outer space, it is paramount to identify and address the concerns and challenges faced by the emerging space actors and the common issues. faced by both established and imaging space actors in outer space. Fifth, there is a need to identify a clear distinction on what needs to be controlled, whether it is the technology or how such technology is used. This is important in view of the dual-use nature of technology. Sixth, regardless of whether there is technically an arms race, it is critical to understand the effect and repercussions of interfering with space system. considering that space will continue to be used for military purposes. Seven, with regard to notifications of military operations and exercise, we would like to qualify that this must not in any way hamper operations and responsibility in defending national sovereignty. Mr. Chair, in closing, we look forward to a productive discussion and successful outcome of this final OEWG. Thank you.",4
S4M14,4,2,Peru,"Thank you, Chair. Let me begin by reiterating Peru's gratitude for seeing Chile at the helm of such important work. We welcome the draft report, which was circulated last week, and which is an excellent basis for further developing our debates this week. We would also like to recognize your efforts through the preparation of the document elements on question 6A and 6B regarding the open-ended working group, documents to which Peru contributed through contributions in writing at the start of this year and statements. Peru aligns itself with the statement made by 33 states, delivered this morning by the distinguished delegation of the Philippines. And we will now proceed to provide a few additional comments in our national capacity. The rapid development of science and technology allows humankind to make ever more progress and carry out ever further activities in outer space for the use and exploration of space. Such progress. along with the interest shown by all members of this open-ended working group, have demonstrated that the distinction between developing states and space actors is now obsolete. Therefore, Peru, which was one of Latin America's pioneering states in signing up to the outer space treaty, as well as the other treaties relating to space, would like to reaffirm the applicability of international law, including the UN charter and other relevant branches of international law. In light of people's interest in the peaceful use and exploration of outer space, we would like to recall that outer space should be exploited and used for the common good of humankind and for the benefit of states regardless of their level of scientific and economic development. Also, everyone should be able to benefit from space technologies. Peru also believes that international humanitarian law is applicable to outer space. In particular, we'd like to welcome the contribution here made by the International Red Cross Committee to this debate. A satellite could be considered a critical asset or a strategic asset, as is Peru's case, for institutions can rely on them, institutions that provide essential services for society. I'm talking about communications, about seismic monitoring, about geolocalization services, as well as the management for natural disaster risks, and I name but a few. Chairman, as has been said by other delegations, this working group has inspired inclusive and substantive debates on this topic. And this is an excellent starting point, which is complemented by other related efforts, such as the need for beginning negotiations on a legally binding instrument for preventing an arms race in outer space. or the group of government experts on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and various other meaningful initiatives in the framework of the first committee of the General Assembly. Therefore, Peru believes that there should be a monitoring or further work done by this open-ended working group which should be geared towards greater convergence. This will help prevent the militarization of outer space. Thank you.",1
S4M16,4,2,UAE,"Thank you, Chair. Esteemed delegates, Firstly, allow us to echo Israel's congratulations to our friends in India on their successful and historical lunar landing. Distinguished delegates, my delegation welcomes the fourth session of the open-ended working group and affirms its full support and cooperation towards the successful work of the working group. We recognize the importance of international cooperation in preserving outer space for peaceful uses, including the development of international guidelines and standards governing outer space activities. As we reflect upon the past sessions, We value the unwavering commitment that has been demonstrated in our shared pursuit of achieving the objectives of the open-ended working group. As a contribution from the UAE, we would like to reiterate key elements that align with our views. The UAE's views touch upon the main principles of ensuring a safe, secure, and a sustainable outer space for all Member States, which includes 1. Strengthening trust and transparency between states in maintaining the peaceful uses and prevention of an arms race in outer space for the long-term sustainability of space activities and the space environment. Two, maintaining outer space for peaceful uses only. We also acknowledge the right of member states to develop their capabilities and space systems in a peaceful manner. Three. It is up on member states to take necessary measures to account for the needs and capabilities of states with emerging space programs. This includes promoting knowledge transfer to emerging space nations to build technical capabilities to mitigate risks to space assets while promoting homegrown innovation. 4. The inclusion of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, UNUSA And the outcomes of the Open-ended Working Group on space threats is of paramount significance, given UNUSA's commitment to promoting international cooperation and ensuring the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and their role as the Secretariat of UNCUPOS, their perspective and alignment with the efforts would greatly enhance our collective understanding and mitigation of space threats. Five, equal and fair access to space is an important element to be considered when defining norms, rules, principles, and verification methods that address threats to space systems. Six, there is a need to agree on a reference terminology document which will serve as a tool to accelerate the open-ended working group outcomes in the development of international standards and principles. The UAE reaffirms its full support to the work of the Open-Ended Working Group and reaching consensus. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S4M18,4,2,Indonesia,"Thank you Mr Chair. Since this is the first time my delegation takes the floor, allow me to express our appreciation to your able stewardship in guiding the work of this open-ended working group, as well as your efforts in producing the draft report. Mr Chair, with your permission allow me to share our general view on elements that could be considered in further discussing the substantive report. The interpretation of the term peaceful purposes must encompass the prevention of an arms race in outer space and its weaponization. Any other interpretation would not suffice to prevent nor reduce space threats and would be contrary to the spirit of the Outer Space Treaty. States' adherence and obligations to relevant applicable international law, in particular 1967 Outer Space Treaty, are key to govern conduct of states in their activities in outer space and addresses these threats. The Outer Space Treaty sets out the provision on inclusivity and equality among all states, non-placement of weapons of mass destruction, States' responsibility and liability, and international corporations, all of which are legal obligations in order to reduce space threats. In its preamble, the Treaty also stresses that exploration and use of outer space must be exclusively for peaceful purposes, for the benefit and in the interests of all countries. My delegation supports the inclusion of elements to reaffirm the importance of a good faith, transparency and confidence building in guiding the conduct of states in outer space. In this regard, we believe that there is a need of a robust, transparent of outer space launching system to prevent militarization of outer space or relevant threats in space systems. Making space as a new battle domain will run counter to our objective of preventing arms race in outer space. In that regard, Mr Chair, my delegation would like to underline that the elaboration of rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour as well as transparency and confidence building measures would only be effective if they also lead or contribute to the formulations of a legally binding instruments on Paris. The absence of universal legally binding instrument of Paris opens the possibility of the increased risks and threats of weaponization in outer space. We believe that such instrument will consolidate and reinforce the outer space regime in the context of preventing arms race and will serve as an important cornerstone in reducing space threats. In closing, Mr. Chair, rest assured of Indonesia's full support to your leadership, and we hope that threats to space systems can be discussed and reflected in the draft report in a comprehensive and a balanced manner. I thank you.",4
S4M110,4,2,Egypt,"Thank you, Chair, for giving us the floor. Please allow me at the outset to join the others who congratulated the State of India for their great achievement in moon landing on the south pole of the moon, a great achievement for all developing states, and this confirms that this is now a possibility, a real possibility, for all developing countries. and I would like to be very brief in my statement and I would like to focus on our vision with regard to the draft report. to thank you and your team for your professionalism and able stewardship of our work over the last three sessions and to reassure you the full support of my delegation throughout the final rounds of meetings where we look forward for constructive outcome. I would like also to highly value the professional and dedicated efforts of the UNODA and UNIDIR in support of the work of the OEWG. As we approach the concluding stage of our work, we would like It is quite important to commend the opportunity this OEWG has availed for a dedicated inclusive discussion on the views regarding reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior. We believe that the OEWG is a constructive platform for an inclusive dialogue among the wider UN membership with the participation of all relevant stakeholders in reducing space threats. Through its mandate, this OEWG, we believe it should contribute to its endeavors to all the efforts aiming at achieving the prevention of arms race in outer space, complementing the existing mandates of the Conference on Disarmament, the United Nations Disarmament Commission, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the newly established group of governmental experts on further practical measures for the prevention of an armed race in outer space. Non-legally binding transparency and confidence building measures for outer space activities should complement the existing international legal framework pertaining to outer space activities. Non-legally binding mechanisms should not be perceived as a substitute for legally binding mechanisms and should not undermine the existing legal obligations or hamper the legal use of outer space particularly by emerging space actors. Egypt believes that a comprehensive legally binding instrument on Paris is necessary to avert serious threats to international peace and security, as well as saving the world a huge opportunity cost from the socio-economic point of view, taking into consideration the vast economic resources that would be wasted on our space and outer space that no one can win. We consider that a legally binding treaty is necessary to preserve the long-term sustainability of the peaceful uses of outer space. Mr. Chair, Egypt's comprehensive position on many points addressed through the draft report has been clearly explained in the working paper previously submitted in this regard, and I will not go into details explaining them. It is available on the working paper. Yet I would like to make a very clear point that Egypt does not support any reference to the HECOC with regard to our work. It falls totally beyond the scope of this discussion. Mr. Chair, my delegation considers the first draft you have circulated a good basis for our discussions this week, yet work still needed to have it actually reflecting the accepted common ground and points of convergence in a comprehensive manner. The question on how to follow up on our work is very relevant, yet it should take into consideration that such follow-up should be inclusive and fully aligned with the ongoing and the upcoming processes, relevant processes, in particular the newly established GGE. Having said that, Mr. Chair, let me assure you of the full cooperation and dedication of the delegation of Egypt. with the view of reaching a consensus report, clearly reflecting the points of consensus and emerging convergence. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M112,4,2,Austria,"Austria aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union and the written contributions submitted. In addition, we would like to share some remarks in our national capacity. We want to start with thanking you for your excellent leadership in the past three sessions, the structure of the discussions, your various papers and the excellent selection of panelists have provided us with deep insight and fruitful discussions. The draft report you have submitted to us is comprehensive. and reflects not only the breadth of the discussions, but also the diversity in views. We will actively engage in the deliberations of the text in the coming days, and are eager to hear the views of others, but would also like to share some general remarks already at this point. First, let me underline once again the importance and timeliness of the work conducted under the mandate received by the General Assembly. In light of increasing risks and threats in outer space and to its peaceful use for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, This working group represents an opportunity to provide multilateral answers to these security challenges. We can recognize the benefits of a behavior-based approach due to the inherent dual-use nature of many space systems, which requires a better understanding on possible threats and their perception. We see the value of this work for the establishment of a legally binding instrument in the future, while addressing the most pressing challenges in the short term. Mr. Chair, the discussions during the three previous sessions focused on the topic set out in Resolution 676-231 under its paragraph 5. We welcome that these discussions and their structure are reflected in the draft report and as such take stock of the existing legal framework, consider threats and irresponsible behaviour and provide recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles, as tasked by the General Assembly. In light of the unique nature of outer space and the changing situation through new technologies and stakeholders, it is highly important to reaffirm the applicability of international law in outer space. We consider our past discussion on certain concepts of the outer space treaty a highly important exercise. Many of them, and in particular the concept of due regard, harbors large potential for the new space age, but need more detailed interpretation. We agree on the account reflection in the text with some additions to be proposed. but also see value in continuing these discussions. The application of international humanitarian law is of particular relevance for the mandate of the OEWG. The significance of such an affirmation lies mostly in the huge reverberating effects even the smallest armed confrontations in outer space could have on the civilian population and civilian objects on Earth, and therefore the necessity to observe its principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution. We see a clear need for a strengthened application of current international law as currently recommended in the report. At the same time, we should also not forget the instruments that are already at hand. More specifically, the De Hague Code of Conduct and the Convention on Registration of Objects launched into outer space. As one of the states who has ratified all outer space treaties, we encourage other states to do the same. The current situation in outer space is insufficiently regulated. We are in need of rules of the road that define and specify existing provisions of the outer space treaty, also taking into account examples from the legal regimes governing air and sea. This includes guidance on how to conduct rendezvous and proximity operations in a non-threatening and transparent way. Further iterations of our working group could establish minimum separation distances, all practices and procedures in this regard. Another issue is the lack of means to sea. A proper assessment of behavior in outer space and the attribution of malign activities will only be possible through expanding the sharing of SSA data and through an expansion of the available information on space objects. We therefore support recommendation K and the many benefits of international cooperation on global SSA capabilities through a dedicated mechanism, ideally within the framework of COPUOS and the assistance of UNOSA. Mr. Chair, the biggest threat for the peaceful use of outer space is the creation of space debris. through various means. Ways to address the threat include a clear norm against further direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests, as well as other co-orbital attacks generating debris. The member states of the European Union have collectively committed to not conduct any such tests. Austria itself has made a further national commitment not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests on the 30th of March, 2023, within the conference of disarmament. We are also concerned about the incapacity incapacitating effects of cyber attacks, also as it is difficult to assert accountability and responsibility in such incidents. Another element of our work we need to highlight again, and which deserves sufficient space and emphasis in our report, is the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure. This is necessary due to the reliance of white parts of societies on outer space in health care, transportation, communication, or energy. and to the problem of dual use of many space systems. Let me also share some remarks on our future work. We support the continuation of this working group in order to further build on our efforts and expand the understandings achieved so far. Many work streams and ideas have only started their career and we are eager to continue their discussion. By now, we do also have a clear understanding of the relation of our work with other bodies such as COPWAS, the UNDC, the CIDI, and the upcoming TGE on Paris and where to add value. We particularly valued the inclusiveness of this process, which matches the global repercussions of the threat it is meant to address. In the same vein, we appreciate the multi-stakeholder approach of the OEWG and the participation of international organizations, commercial actors, and civil society. Any new OEWG will have to continue its work in a similar manner. Mr. Chair, once again, let me assure you of our support in achieving a substantial outcome this week, and we will actively engage in the upcoming discussions. And as a final point, we also want to join others in congratulating India for its moon landing. I'm personally very excited about the scientific results that will come from this mission. I think this is the spirit in which we should also conduct this working group. In the end, many of the activities in outer space are benefiting for all of mankind. Thank you.",1
S4M114,4,2,Cuba,"Thank you, Chairman. It's a pleasure to have you back. The Cuban delegation would like to begin its statement by joining congratulations to the Indian delegation on their excellent successful landing on the moon last week. This is to their credit and will be the benefit to all of us. Thank you for all the hard work you have been doing as chairman of this group. We know that you've spared no effort to bring this session of the committee to a positive ending. despite the differences which we've seen and heard on this particular topic since we adopted the resolution setting up this group. You have always striven to seek consensus and we appreciate that. We also appreciate the value and relevance of the existing international legal system in respect of the use of space. We strictly respect the treaties and principles which govern states' activities. in respect of exploring and using space for peaceful purposes. However, this does not, per se, guarantee the prevention of an armed race in outer space. And that is why we think we need to consolidate and strengthen the existing system so as to guarantee that we have space security, only peaceful activities carried out in space, and full transparency in respect of the latter. These are issues which we think should be reflected in our final outcome document. We would like to underscore, sir, the importance also of respecting the mandates of the various United Nations bodies and committees which consider the various aspects of outer space and human interaction with it so as to avoid duplication, including in respect of the output of this working group. Transparency and conference building measures and other voluntary measures should be just a provisional step on the road towards the full adoption of a legally binding instrument. This latter will strengthen security and predictability of activities carried out in space through providing inter alia a ban on the placing of future weapons in space. The negotiation of a legally binding instrument is something which we think should be a key element of the report, one on which specific recommendations should be made. The Russian Federation has already put forward several important suggestions in their most recent working document. We are happy that there is some preliminary language on this instrument. But nonetheless, we do think we need to do more to emphasize the express prevention of the further placing of weapons in space. Chairman, no outcome here and in other settings can in any way undermine the legitimate right of each and every state to benefit from space technology which they can use for peaceful purposes in order to promote their development. And that... on an equal footing with every other state and without any discrimination. Declarations on legal principles and on international cooperation make this clear. We would like to reiterate that we do not think limits should be placed on access to space for any countries who at the moment have limited or no participation in space exploration and space use. On the contrary, we should be working to avoid... the harmful practices of some space powers which cause harm to the full and equal enjoyment of the use of space for peaceful purposes for other countries. The Non-Aligned Movement very recently in the course of discussions on outer space in the Disarmament Committee last April, I think this was urged very strongly that states refrain from adopting any unilateral measures. which might run counter to international law and which might also place obstacles in the way of or prevent peaceful space activities being carried out by developing countries. We would support what has been said in Torelia by the delegations of Venezuela and the Islamic Republic of Iran on this point, and we urge, Chairman, that international cooperation be mandatory rather than optional, which is what it appears to be. as reflected at the moment in this zero draft of our outcome document. Chairman, we feel that in promoting universal consideration of space as a shared heritage of all mankind, we would be urging all countries to protect the peaceful use of space and protect it in the future. Only this way can we guarantee that space is used correctly for peaceful activity and at the same time bring down the level of space threats. This also is something we think should be clearly reflected in the document. Chairman, we also need to avoid distortion, multiple interpretation and harmful reinterpretation of the existing legal framework. Clarification of revisions on the peaceful use of space is one thing, but these should be solely considered in the Legal Committee of Corporates. This working group does not have a mandate to do this, as has already been made clear by the distinguished delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Chairman, we consider it a shared responsibility that all of us bear to avoid space becoming a location for... armed conflict. This would not only effectively destroy the promising future of space applications for the sustainable development of the Earth and its inhabitants, but it would actually constitute a major threat to the existence of both the Earth and its inhabitants. We think that the potential militarization of space is a major threat at the moment, as is the further deployment of weapons in it. Preventing that is what any agreement we reach should be focused on. In conclusion, Chairman, we would like to say that we have had rich and substantive discussions at this session, and these have highlighted several things. Firstly, the fact that all delegations agree on the growing importance of space, and secondly, that we have a clear divergence. on which focus we should take to best maintain peace and security in space. In order to reach consensus, we're going to have, we think, to concentrate on those elements where there is no consensus and avoid saying we've reached an agreement in areas where we clearly haven't. We are... willing to continue to work to build consensus, and you can rely on the active and constructive participation of Cuba in this process as the work continues. Thank you.",4
S4M116,4,2,Chile,"First of all, allow me to congratulate you and express our gratitude for your leadership in this open-ended working group. We rely on your vast experience on disarmament affairs, sharing various international bodies devoted to outer space, security and sustainability. And we believe your efforts... your efforts will lead us to reaching a consensus report. Chile supports the UN statement made by the Philippines and emphasizes the complementarity of this group with the mandates of the Conference on Disarmament, the United Nations Disarmament Commission, the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the newly established Working Group of Government of Experts on Further Practical Measures for the Prevention of the Arms Raising Outer Space. Mr. Chair. We appreciate the constructive dialogues and efforts made by member states in order to achieve consensus among divergent positions. We recall the promotion of common positions of the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region, taking advantage of our shared values, our region's multilateral tradition, and of course, the chairmanship of the OEWG, who is a representative of this region. In this regard, we would like to thank the Argentinian authorities and Secure World Foundation for organizing the workshop and analysis of recommendations for space threat reduction through possible norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior, suggestions to the OEWG for Latin America and the Caribbean. We would like to recognize the importance and contribution of non-governmental delegations in these discussions. In particular, we thank the delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross for its contributions in the area of international humanitarian law. Finally, Chile reiterates the full validity of international law and the norms of international humanitarian law, and emphasizes the complementarity and non-competitive nature of the different processes, in particular of the OEWG and the GEG of the UN, and the OEWG and the GEG of Paros. We stand ready to support your efforts towards a successful and substantive outcome by the end of this meeting. as a further step to guarantee the present and future secure environment for space technology enjoyment. Thank you. Muchas gracias.",1
S4M118,4,2,Thailand,"Mr. Chair, my delegation would like to join the other to congratulate India for the successful moon landing last week. Thailand would like to commend your stewardship and contribution to the possible elements paper and the draft report that could serve as the basis for our discussion this week. The discussion of the Working Group has proven that we are all increasingly reliant on space systems and services for our security, economies and for the well-being of our society. Thailand wishes to share its preliminary comments on the recommendations in the draft report as follows. First, the recommendations should support space activities and corporations that aim to promote the capacity building measures, space situational awareness, and those activities which will not be used to deceive, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy space systems. Second, the recommendations should also strengthen the effective implementations and the universalization of trust and confidence building measures. as entailed in the report of the GTE. We are of the view that such effective measures can contribute to the effort to prevent armrest in outer space by decreasing tension and risk to the conflict. Third, the recommendations should highlight the norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors, which are encapsulated in the existing international treaties, including the UN Charter, the Outer Space Treaty, and the Partial Test Ban Treaty. It is a prime time to focus on how we can work together to foster and increase responsible behaviors in accordance to international laws. Mr. Chair, before I end my remarks, my delegation wish to express our support to the work of the OEWG that can serve as a platform to further identify, prevent, and mitigate existing and potential threats. to space security and in an inclusive manner. You can count on Thailand's full support and ladiness to work with other delegations in reaching the substantive outcome. I thank you.",1
S4M120,4,2,Turkey,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. We would like to thank you for unwavering efforts in reaching a substantive and consensus-based final report. You can count on our delegation's support in your endeavors. Mr. Chair, Turkey attaches particular attention to the prevention of arms raids in space and the protection of the right of unrestricted access to and use of other space for the benefit and welfare of all countries. In this regard, We welcome the UN Secretary General policy brief titled For All Humanity, The Future of Outer Space Governance published last May. We welcome the emphasis made during the discussion of the Working Group on hindered and unhindered access to space and related technologies while recognizing the challenge of the dual-use nature of some space objects. There is an increasing need for differentiating civil or military objectives of space objects, which could be regarded as a good example of norms in this field. It is also important to maintain transparency and trust by increasing international cooperation in the field of space. Bearing in mind the current state of play in international affairs, the establishment of a legal basis doesn't seem to be likely in the near future. This shouldn't impede us to work towards the development of a peaceful and stable space domain. Developing a shared understanding of norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors is essential to provide transparency and increased trust and international cooperation in outer space. It could also pave the way for a future legally binding instrument in this field. Recognizing that a possible substantive outcome in this open-ended working group is crucial in this regard, we call on all parties to show flexibility as much as possible. I thank you.",4
S4M122,4,2,Algeria,"Thank you, Mr. Chapperson. The delegation of Algeria would like to convey to yourself their highest regard for your efforts in preparing this fourth session of the Open Ended Working Group with regard to reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles. And we can rely on the support of our delegation in your endeavors. The delegation of Algeria highly values your efforts in preparing the draft report which was circulated to us and which presents a good basis for discussions of the open and end working group. And we shall contribute constructively in the discussions of this document with regard to item seven of the agenda, as you have mentioned, with regard to the organizational matters. And we shall only talk now about the general matters, just like every other delegation who spoke before us. Firstly, Algeria shares its concern with regard to the increasing threat represented by the arms race in outer space and its ramifications on the international peace and security and all fields of daily life, economic and social and scientific. This arms race... requires all our countries to bear the responsibilities in committing to activities which might represent a risk towards our common goal of achieving security in outer space as an environment free of weapons of mass destruction or any other sort of arms race in a manner that permits everyone to benefit from space. The increasing use of space requires increased transparency and ambition with regard to confidence-building measures. And in this regard, all countries who have great space capabilities have a particular responsibility in the effective participation to achieving peace in outer space and to prevent arms race in the outer space, as well as refraining from any activity that might be in contradiction with this goal. and with the UN Charters and its rules and the principles of international law to safeguard peace and security and promote international cooperation. Outer space and celestial bodies remain a common treasure for all humanity which shall be explored, used in a spirit of cooperation to the best benefit of all humankind and countries and regardless of their degree of development or scientific progress. and with regard to achieving the full use of technology in outer states through cooperation, technical assistance, and building capacities in this regard in developing states. Algeria once again reaffirms its support for all efforts in the organization of international law in the outer space in order to prevent any accidents and grave threats to international peace and security in outer space. Algeria considers the disarmament conference, which is the only multilateral negotiating body with regard to disarmament, should be the one playing the pioneering role in this field in maintaining negotiations with regard to legal instruments pertaining to the issues listed on the agenda of the conference with regard to prevention of arms race. in outer space. This endeavor of Paros also reflects the many commitments made during the Disarmament Conference and Algeria's voting records at the General Assembly of the United Nations in this regard, especially the resolution establishing this open-ended working group. And we shall always keep up a balanced approach. in dealing with issues pertaining to outer space. Mr. Chairperson, the issues discussed in this open-ended working group have a great importance with regard to the UNGA Resolution 76231, with regard to the current and future challenges with regard to security in outer space. And the thematic discussions which have taken place so far... In addition to the submissions made so far, the working documents have led us to a clear understanding with regard to many issues pertaining to the organisational and legal concepts, especially with regard to threats emanating from the behaviour of states in outer space, with regard to UN Charter and the Outer Space Treaty. In this regard, the tasks and the terms of reference of the OWG based on the review of the current legal instruments with regard to all the states, also dealing with the current legal gaps in this regard. And this is one of the most important aspects related to AutosPage, which require codification and framework. And this also requires the final report needed to complement the existing legal framework and the rules of responsible behavior, as well as the end goal of preventing arms race in outer space that has to be reflected very clearly in this report through negotiations in an expedited manner to achieve new legally binding instruments to achieve the end goal of the International Committee in this regard. The Algerian delegation would like to reaffirm the need for balance and clarity with regard to the legally binding instrument. Non-legally binding measures cannot be a good precondition to achieving this, but only a manner of facilitating negotiation. And in this regard, the full and actual respect of existing legal frameworks and the well-intentioned in this regard can enshrine these rules and frameworks. And this can lend more vitality to achieving a good image of good behavior by countries in safeguarding international peace and security. In this regard, we need to keep our discussions in their comprehensive framework and to achieve consensus with regard to Paris. according to the vision that was dedicated by paragraph 80 of the final report of the UNGA which states the need for further measures and the starting of international appropriate negotiations with regard to a space treaty. My delegation seeks the spirit of consensus to rein over our negotiations and discussions. and for all positions to be overviewed in a balanced manner, achieving further consensus in the future. at the EOEWG. Mr. Chapperson, finally we would like to reaffirm our full willingness to collaborate with the Member States in order to fully collaborate and we would like to see the opportunity to convey our thanks to the UNODA and UNIDIR for their valuable efforts. Thank you, Mr. Chapperson.",4
S4M124,4,2,Brazil,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Allow me to begin by congratulating you and your team for your stewardship of this process thus far and for the preparation of the draft report that we have before us. We believe that the draft captures the gist of our proposals and ideas discussed throughout the three previous sessions and that it represents a very solid basis for the substantive outcome that we fervently wish this OAWG will achieve. My delegation associates itself with the joint statement delivered by the delegation of the Philippines on behalf of the Friends of the UAWG. We also wish to take this opportunity to join others in congratulating India for its lunar exploration mission, Chandrayaan 3. The success of this ambitious and bearing endeavor is a success for all humankind. Mr. Chairman. My delegation stated clearly in the previous three sessions of the UAWG that Brazil remains firmly attached to the objective of negotiating a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. However, we see no opposition between that objective and the pursuit of the mandate of this working group, that is, the recommendation of non-binding norms on state behavior. We believe that such non-binding norms would contribute to clarifying the generic principles contained in the outer space treaty and their relevance to space security in a manner that is analogous to the work that has been carried out by copuas over the past seven decades in the field of civilian space activities. Rizou believes that such clarification would represent invaluable contributions to solving the conceptual disagreements that have thus far hobbled our efforts to reach consensus on a treaty on Paris. Mr. Chair, regarding the contents of your draft report, beyond the comments made in the joint statement of the Friends of the UAWG, my delegation has a few additional remarks to make in its national capacity. First, my delegation commands the recognition of the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, International Humanitarian Law, throughout the space. My delegation wishes, however, to propose to include a reference to the 1977 Convention on the Prohibition of Military and Other Hostile Uses. of environmental modification techniques and mod. Another issue of particular interest to my delegation is the issue of destructive anti-satellite weapons. These weapons and their testing have been identified by numerous states as one of the primary drivers of insecurity in outer space, as evidenced by the national positions consolidated in the report of the UN Secretary General, contained in document A slash 76 slash 77. While reiterating the positions expressed in our working paper on the issue of destructive ASAP weapons circulated during the third session of the UAWG, my delegation strongly supports the proposal by the ICRC on paragraph 20 of your draft report, which states that there is no international obligation that specifically prohibits the creation of debris caused by deliberate hostile acts or by the destructive testing of anti-satellite weapons. by recalling that there are relevant rules of international law that may nevertheless prohibit or restrict behaviors prone to the creation of debris. Mr. Chairman, Brazil is firmly committed to ensuring the continuation of the work carried out in this working group and to the preservation of a forum on issues related to space security open to the participation of all states in an inclusive and participatory manner. We are also committed to ensuring that the results of the SOAWG builds on many discussions and that our recommendations become a firm basis for the negotiation of a legally binding instrument or instruments on that issue. The upcoming GGE on Paris is the most promising avenue to ensure that this goal is reached. Brazil has chaired the first GGE on Paris established by the General Assembly, which concluded its work in 2019. Regrettably, the group was unable to reach consensus on substantive recommendations. That result was not due to shortcomings of its final report, which was widely praised as balanced, consistent, and useful. Instead, the lack of consensus derived from mistrust among key players, which prevented the leap of faith that is necessary in order for generating progress on disarmament, non-proliferation, and arms control to take place. We believe that in order for the upcoming GGE not to repeat the dynamics of its predecessor, we will need to inject a dose of resolve and mutual trust into the process. In Brazil's view, the successful conclusion of the present OEWG and the adoption of recommendations on norms for responsible behavior in outer space can play that crucial role. Having been selected to participate in the upcoming GGE, Brazil will undertake all efforts to ensure that the work of both four are characterized by complementarity and a mutually reinforcing dynamics. Mr. Chair, before we move into informal closed negotiations on a draft outcome report, rest assured that Brazil will support your efforts to bring this OEWG to a successful conclusion. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M126,4,2,Colombia,"Thank you very much, Chairman. As this is the first time that I'm taking the floor, allow me to begin by congratulating you on your skillful leadership of our work. And I'd like to convey to you Columbia's full support for your mandate. As everyone knows, my delegation supported the statement that was delivered on behalf of 33 states by the distinguished delegation of the Philippines this morning. The content of that statement made it possible for us to reiterate once again our gratitude to the Chairman and the Secretariat for the preparation of this session of the Open-ended Working Group. We'd also like to thank you for your summary and for the working papers that were circulated by various states and delegations. We welcome the efforts that have been made, and we'd like to express our support for future developments and our full cooperation for ensuring that the work of this working group is compatible with the work of other fora within the UN system relevant to the space domain, be it in arms reduction or the applicability of international humanitarian law amongst other things. We'd like to highlight the importance that the norms, rules, and principles of responsible on mitigating the impacts of the militarization and use of force in outer space, and in particular the consequences that these might have on the population at large because of the interruption of common services or goods that are based on outer space services or assets. Therefore, we believe it is more necessary than ever to reach agreements so as to adapt the international legal framework to matters relating to the use of outer space and ensure that these uses are fit for our times, times marked by swift development technology. We also must ensure the peaceful use of outer space and thereby contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. You can... all count on Colombia's full support. Thank you.",1
S4M128,4,2,Pakistan,"Thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you for stating the work of our open-ended working group and we would also like to thank UNODA and UNIDAY for their efforts in assisting you in coming up with this draft report. Mr. Chair, we will be sharing the detailed comments on the draft report in the informal setting of course as you have desired, but at this point in time let me take this opportunity in sharing some of our journal comments and observations on the work that is ahead of us. Although my delegation did not vote in favour of the resolution, still we joined in the work of Open-ended Working Group and we have been participating constructively in our sessions. Mr Chair, the resolution was non-consensual one, but we do not have that option when it comes to adoption of our report. It has to be adopted by consensus. Now how can we do that? We believe that it is important we preserve our common understandings of the past. and build on the convergences in the report. The common understanding needs to be developed regarding the conceptual framework also. Throughout our work of this open-ended working group, there have been concerns expressed on the framing of the conceptual framework of responsible behaviour. We believe that an approach that takes into account both capabilities and behaviour is the most balanced way to move forward. We believe that we can address this balance, Mr Chair, in our report. as we have done in the past as well, for example in the GGE report of TCBMs in 2013. In our view, the primary litmus test for the relevance and value addition of this open-ended working group is whether and to what extent it maintains international consensus on preventing an arms race in outer space or Paris. For us, Paris remains the North Star as far as objectives of this open-ended working group is concerned. Forcing the dangers of militarization of outer space, the international community has been calling for decades for further measures and appropriate international negotiations to prevent an arms race in outer space. The SSOD-1 and numerous subsequent UNGA resolutions reaffirmed that realization of this long-standing imperative. This open-ended working group should endeavor to answer the fundamental question of how to launch Paris negotiations on urgent basis. This open-ended working group is also taking stock of international rules and laws, and we welcome the work and efforts that has gone into report in this direction. While taking stock, it is important that the open-ended working group is also able to state clearly about the gaps that exist in our legal regime. and we believe that for those gaps to be filled, legal fixes are required. Mr Chair, TCBMs can play a complementary role, but they can neither be a substitute nor a precondition to legally binding approaches. The norms, rules and principles can be supported in our work and in the report as long as they are contributing to the broader objectives of preventing an arms race in outer space. Mr. Chair, regarding the future outcome of this open-ended working group and follow-up, we believe that whatever this open-ended working group is able to adopt and decide, it should complement the work of the Paris GGE that is being established. I think it's important to build synergies and complementarities to ensure how this process is followed up. It would be premature at this stage to think and decide in isolation about another open-ended working group without first assessing the contribution for the Paris GGE. Mr. Chair, and the last, we assure you of our full support to the work of this group and enduring the negotiations of our report. Thank you once again.",1
S4M130,4,2,Argentina,"Thank you, Chairman. First and foremost, allow me to congratulate you on all the work that was done during the intersessional period and for presenting this draft report, which we believe is a sound basis for the discussions that lie ahead this week. You can count on my delegation's full support for bringing this cycle of discussions to a successful conclusion. In addition to the declaration delivered by the Philippines this morning, with which we align ourselves, we'd like to make the following comments in a national capacity. The importance of outer space for everyday activities has led to the development of counter space capabilities that... can be used to try and degrade or undermine the space systems of other nations. For Argentina, such counter space measures to counter or destroy or jeopardize other systems can put at threat satellite systems which are involved in telecommunications or earth monitoring and also they can disrupt the services provided to the national and international communities. Therefore, we believe that the work of this group is particularly important on that particular account. Argentina supports the work of the open-ended working group, but at the same time, we believe it is important to preserve the work that is done in Copuos. We must avoid overlapping topics, topics being discussed in both fora. The work done by Copus, however, should serve as food for thought within this group. We need to ensure that we reach consensus on technical points and make sure that the points we agree on are of use to all of humankind. That is why we believe that we should not be too restrictive in the definitions that we use regarding behaviors. Regarding the safety and security of space activities and diminishing potential risks, we believe it is essential to foster dialogue and communication. These should take place in a timely way and a transparent fashion, and we should foster the exchange of information, international cooperation, and the establishment of contact points. Similarly, it is vital to respect the principles and norms set out in existing space treaties and documents, including the guidelines on the sustainability of activities in space and other co-pros. documents and also those regarding nuclear power. Also the relevant provisions of the register of satellites and other space objects. We also believe it is important to ensure that de-orbit or re-entry activities are carefully monitored so as to reduce... the risks linked to space debris and the risk of collision. It is important to uphold the international community's commitment to not place weapons in outer space and to ensure that we minimise the risk of collision or unplanned manoeuvres. In Argentina, we held the regional work group on the reduction of space threats. This allowed our region to exchange views and information about the different aspects that are relevant to this group's mandate. We welcome the participation of the countries of the region and the Secure War Foundation and UNIDIR as well as your own participation in that event, Chairman. Thank you.",1
S4M132,4,2,North Korea,"the work of this group. Having listened to some allegations made against my country, I am compelled to take the floor to categorically reject them, in particular the pretty posterous and shameful and also illogical claims made by South Korea and Japan. of military reconnaissance satellite is a legitimate response to the undisguised military series of US and its allies and exercise of the universal right of the sovereign state to defend its sovereignty and internal integrity. Nobody is entitled to take the issue with this. DPRK's satellite launch should be particularly blamed. The US and all other countries which have already launched 1,000 satellites should also be punished and condemned. This is nothing but the sophism of self-contradiction and also politicization. What a shame. Everybody says no politicization, but their actions, their behaviors, means politicization. The UN Security Council's resignation against DPRK that banned the legitimate right of an individual member of the State of the UN to develop the space are nothing but illegal documents wantonly violating UN Charter and other international law as they are products of hostile policy of the US and its followers. towards DPRK aimed to deprive the DPRK of its sovereignty and right to existence and development. I would like to underline once again that my country never ever recognized and rejected and will not be bound by such resolutions. which seriously violating DPRK's right to use space. How can DPRK's self-defense measures, like launching satellite, be branded as a provocation or threat to peace and security? And how can the US and other countries spy satellite satellite launch and military exercise such as U.S.-South Korea joint military drills against my country at its doorstep be justified, portrayed, even beautified as the protection of peace and security. The development of military reconnaissance satellite is directly related to the security of our state, which is under constant military threat by US and other hostile forces. One of the latest examples is the large ever-joint military exercise drill named Ulchi Freedom Shield. by the US and South Korea, which kicked off from last week. These joint military drills, which have been held for more than half a century, is getting more and more dangerous and aggressive and more and more frequent as it mobilizes the huge number of military personnel US status assets and with a detailed attack plan. As a group of delegation who spoke about the DPRK once again revealed their ill-intended attempt to politicize this forum to direct pressure on DPRK, which will never work. As for Japan, whatever we do, whatever we're launching, they have no face to say this and that about my country. It's because they have already seven spire satellites, and then they are planning to run the network of the spire satellite, adding three more. So their irresponsible behavior will only divert our attention from the substantive discussion on the draft report. I strongly demand them to stop such an unintended attempt to artificially hinder the work of the group. with the issue, not related to our discussion. I thank you.",2
S4M134,4,2,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to respond. Not having commented on this issue until now, I am compelled to make some brief remarks. We reject the disingenuous claims that the US is acting in a hostile manner. US allied military exercises are routine. They are lawful. And they are defensive in nature. And unlike the DPRK's ballistic missile launches, They are not prohibited by the United Nations Security Council resolutions. As a reminder, the DPRK actually conducted six ICBM launches in 2022 before the United States and the Republic of Korea resumed our large-scale exercises in August of that year. The UN Security Council has repeatedly demanded the DPRK not conduct any further launches using ballistic missile technology. These launches directly undermine the non-proliferation regime. They move us away from our collective goal of disarmament. And they threaten the DPRK's neighbors and the entire world. Thank you.",2
S4M136,4,2,South Korea,"Thank you Mr. Chair for giving me the floor to exercise our delegation's right of reply. The DPRK insists that the recent launch was an exercise in the right for the peaceful use of outer space. It is simply appalling to see how the DPRK is denying the legitimacy of the UN Security Council resolutions. I have already explained the very reason why the UN Security Council resolution unanimously and repeatedly prohibited any launch using ballistic missile technology by the DPRK. Indeed, it has been developing its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs based on its own playbook. We should not fall for its deceptive tactics to legitimize its illegal and prohibited launching under the pretext of peaceful uses of our space or to deny the legitimacy of the UN Security Council decisions. Taking this opportunity, I would also like to explain how its so-called satellite launching activity can be relevant to our working group's discussions. As a clear illustration, it did not issue airspace or maritime safety notifications to the International Maritime Organization. nor the International Civil Aviation Organization, or the International Telecommunications Union. As pointed out by the Assistant Secretary General, Mr. Khalid Kerry, during the open briefing of the UN Security Council in August 25, convened in response to the DPR case launch, such an announced launch represents a serious risk to the international civil aviation and maritime traffic and a threat to international peace and security. The launch was illegal, unlawful, and at the same time, irresponsible, and we condemn the DPRK for such action. With regard to the DPRK's false claim of the U.S. and the ROK's hostile policy, I would like to remit our right of reply to simply point out that an allegation is simply not true. The hostile policy is not the root cause of the situation in Korean Peninsula. And there is no such thing as hostile policy. The DPRK's ever-growing threat from its unlawful nuclear missile programs are the very reason why we are strengthening extended deterrence cooperation with the US, not the other way around. And I would just because this does not fall into the mandate of the OEW working group, I will not indulge into the to explain what Ilji-Pullyeon, what Ilji exercise is about. It's just a. mere exercise of the government officials to what to do in just in case there is a war in Korean Peninsula. It's not a war exercise. It's how we will respond if there is a war in Korean Peninsula. Thank you.",2
S4M138,4,2,Japan,"Thank you, Mr. Chairperson, for giving me the floor. It is unfortunate that I am bound to exert the right of reply by the misleading intervention by the representative of DPRK on Japanese space policy. Japan's activities in the field of space development are in full compliance with the Outer Space Treaty and other relevant international agreements. and are strictly for peaceful uses based on the principles of pacifism of our constitution. It is completely inappropriate to compare Japan with North Korea, since the latter is prohibited from conducting any launch using ballistic missile technology, including artificial satellites, by the relevant use UN Security Council resolutions. Thank you very much.",2
S4M140,4,2,North Korea,"I'm sorry to ask for a second right of reply. As for the situation, even nowadays, even at this moment, the U.S. and South Korea are playing dangerous war games that might incite an unprecedented nuclear war in Korean Peninsula, while advocating logic over strength. So why we have to develop nuclear deterrent and ISPM programs is because we are under the consistent threat of the America and ISRIs for more than 70 years. They started joint military exercise more than half century ago, and then the scales of joint military exercise getting bigger and bigger, and then more frequent, and then using more modern military strategic assets. Therefore, we have to develop our defense capabilities. And as for the South Koreans' response, I'm rather surprised. What South Koreans are doing nowadays reminded me in the past what happened in Korean Peninsula. South Koreans are descendants of Shilla, the kingdom of Korean Peninsula in the past. And what South Koreans are doing nowadays remind me of Silla. Silla, who brought foreign forces to destroy Goguryeo, you know, fellow countries. What they are doing nowadays, just the same ones. But they have to know DPRK. is not in a corporeal. We have strong defense military capabilities, nuclear deterrent, ICBMs at its core. So don't, as for the South Koreans, I ask them, I plead them, don't make a trouble which cannot be copied to copy it. And if you are continuing, You are making a big mistake. Then you will pay a heavy price. As for Japan, we are using every opportunity when we are doing self-defense measures to demilitarize their forces, the demilitarize of Japan. As for Japan, Japan is a defeated country in Second World War. Even UN charter. They are described as an enemy state. They don't have the right to have regular army. They can have only self-defense army, which means no air forces, no marine forces. But what do you think nowadays? They are increasing military budget every year. They are trying to seek opportunity to regularize their re-militarization. One of the reasons we have to develop our Nissan Air Defense capabilities is Japanese military maneuvers. So nowadays, South Korea and Japan are trying to kind of alliance against my country at the direction of the U.S. Those kinds of inner alliance, or maybe cooperation, I don't know, looks like junior or senior partnerships. As for the South Koreans, Korea was colonized more than 36 years by Japan. But how they can cooperate with Japan? As a Korean, I'm very shame and I'm very sorry to see South Koreans. They have no self-pride. You are colonized by Japan. You are suffered by Japan for more than 36 years. If we are Japan, maybe we will apologize every month, every year. At least 36 years, they should apologize for what they did during the Korean rule of my country. It's really surprising. International order are not right, upside down. Majority always means right. So we know what we are doing. We know we are doing right ones. We know we are doing whatever to do to defend my country, to protect my country, to be equal to the member of the international community. Thank you.",2
S4M142,4,2,South Korea,"Thank you Mr. Chair. Since this item is not relevant to the mandate of the OEWG, I will try to be very brief. I just took the floor to explain that the Republic of Korea takes pride in fully abiding the international instrument and norms on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We take our full pride to be thriving economically and to be thriving politically in a democratic world. by abiding those international instruments and norms on nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. And I think everyone in this room had clearly heard why the Republic of Korea had no choice but to strengthen our military cooperation with the United States in response to the dangerous nuclear rhetoric from the DPRK. I would just limit my intervention to this. And since the delegation from the DPRK has reminded us about the history and the importance of it, I'd just like to remind him who has started the Korean War in 1950. Thank you.",2
S4M144,4,2,Japan,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairperson. I will be very brief. I'm very sorry to be bound by the irrelevant remarks by the representative of DPRK on our defense policy. Under the constitution, Japan has adhered to the basic precept of maintaining the exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not becoming a military power that poses a threat to other countries and observing the three non-nuclear principles. peace-loving nation. And also, the representative of DPR has wrongly mentioned the course of the history. We are very much humbled to see and to face the history. And also, we are very much proud of the history of reconciliation with our neighboring countries. And also, I hope it will be the case with the United Nations. the country, the government, which the representative of the ITPRK has presented. Thank you very much.",2
S4M146,4,2,North Korea,"Point of order, not a statement. As points of order, I ask who is making continuation of these discussions? Who raised the first issue? This is not related to the discussion we are doing nowadays. But I'm surprised. So the right of the flight cannot be given to my country because of rules of procedure. I think it is the first time at the CD meetings. One time I had a false right of reply. But I had only two. But you say rules of procedure, so right of reply is not allowed. It's not equal. It's not the kinds of discrimination I felt from the chair. I'm very sorry to say that. So, I want to say one more thing. The outrageous and the people's claims by South Korea and Japan deserve no response. To us, their deceptive and hypocritical association only sounds like a desperate scream of a person in despair. The rationale and reason behind such a pose and face attitude is to justify the provocation action and propose... There is a point of order by another delegation,",2
S4M148,4,2,United States,"Yes, Mr. Chairman, it was a point of order.",2
S4M12,4,9,Russia,"Thank you very much, distinguished chair. You have now highlighted some points related to the organization of the work of our group today. Also, you said that you prepared a chairperson summary in your personal capacity. Could you please clarify? How are you planning to circulate this summary? What work will we be carrying out related to the presentation of the summary, especially in light of the fact that Just now you proposed that we carry out work on the draft report. Moreover, we're seeking additional clarification to find out how will we be carrying out our future work on the draft report as far as I understood yesterday. during our informal consultations There was no reference made to a procedural report. We were somewhat surprised when we received this latest draft. But in any case, if there's a desire or willingness by delegations to work on this draft report, then we are ready to actively participate in that work. But we believe, in light of the work carried out by the group in during the consideration of the previous version of the report and also during the informal consultations. we believe that it would be justified. and in fact it'll be just simply honest, fair to continue. our work on this version of the report in the form of informal consultations. This is how I understand your proposal, and if that is indeed the case, then we will be ready to actively and constructively participate in the study of the draft report of this working group. Thank you.",1
S4M14,4,9,Philippines,"Thank you Mr. Chair. First of all, thank you for your excellent, fair, balanced leadership. And we are in full support of the way you have been steering the work of this group. We also would support your prerogative to prepare a chairperson summary under your own responsibility and I would agree with you that it is best that we leave it to your judgment given that we are pressed for time. In terms of the consideration of the procedural importance to the inclusive and open manner with which this OEWG is animated. And in this spirit, we would have a very strong preference to consider the approval of the procedural report in a formal manner so that our colleagues at CAPITOL can watch the proceedings. Thank you.",1
S4M16,4,9,Russia,"Thank you very much, distinguished chairperson. First we'd like to receive a reply to our question, namely, how are you planning to present your summary? in different international form because the General Assembly or UN member states did not give you any instructions to do that. Moreover, what we are talking about now is a consideration of yet another version of the draft report. And I specifically am not saying for a procedural report because the nature of this document will, in fact, require further discussion. I'm reading the title of the document that you presented to us. It is yet another version of the draft report of the group. and against the background of your proposal to start the discussions of the draft report, it's very unusual for us to listen to you say that you are planning to prepare a summary. And this is why we're asking this question. Now on procedural issues that were just now referred to by the distinguished representative of the Philippines. In other words, the proposals to continue our work on this version of the draft report in a formal plenary session. We believe that this is a very inconsistent approach. Previously, we carried out our work on the previous versions of the draft report in informal consultations. My colleagues in Moscow would also really like to listen to the way the discussions are being held in connection with the work of this working group. And I think that... the international community and colleagues from non-governmental organizations would also be very much interested in this work, especially since a lot of things were discussed and presented, and for our part we presented a whole set of different proposals, very substantive proposals to be included in the draft final report. stage we have to continue our work on the draft final report in a formal plenary session. Now if a relevant decision is to be taken, then I'm afraid that we would be forced to present our substantive proposals on the draft final report, and in that case we would prefer to start considering the very first version of the draft final report that was circulated. in order to ensure that in an official formal plenary we will have a substantive discussion on the results of the work of the working group. Now if distinguished delegations insist on that, we are ready to carry out that work and we will actively and constructively participate in such work. But as far as I understood, you, Mr. Chair, your idea was somewhat different. not to start such discussions in a formal plenary, but rather carry out our work on the draft final report in informal consultations, closed consultations, only with the participation of UN member states. That was a proposal that was made on Monday. All delegations supported that proposal and we believe that this is exactly the way we should carry out our work on the draft final report if we wish to achieve any results. Thank you.",1
S4M18,4,9,Panama,"Thank you very much, Chair. Good morning to distinguished colleagues. At the outset, I'd like to join those who thanked you for circulating so quickly this draft. of the procedural report and we fully support the focus that you are taking. We believe that it is important to have a summary under your responsibility. This is not a new practice in the work of these working groups and this is something that we can support your approach. And my second point is that We would also prefer to have discussion in a formal plenary session. But we will, of course, support what you decide to be most relevant. But I think we have already did make all our general statements, and now it's time to look at the report section by section. Thank you.",1
S4M110,4,9,Philippines,"Thank you, Chair. First of all, I commend you for your efforts to bridge the gaps among all parties over the past few days to promote consultations. I have also taken note that... You just mentioned that you would present a chair summary in your own name. We understand this summary. The President As for the chair summary, I have two questions for your clarification. First, The Chair's summary has an official paper number, document number. For instance, for instance, A slash or S slash as an UN official document. Will the Chair's summary have a similar number in the future? Secondly, Any other business I thank the distinguished representative of China and to immediately react to his questions.",2
S4M112,4,9,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for your clarification as to how you intend to proceed with your chair summary. My delegation is a little bit surprised that some would feign surprise about this method considering that this is a common practice in multilateral forums such as this. So we fully support how you intend to proceed. And with regard to how we proceed with our work on our business, which is the final outcome of this OEWG, I fully subscribe to what you have said. There are two considerations. The final report, the substantive report, obviously we are done with that and we are considering how to proceed with regard to our work on considering the procedural report. And I wish to reiterate my delegation's view that it has to be done through a formal setting to participate and to see how we are considering this. And we wish to flag that doing things in formal format is the ordinary form of business of UNGA bodies such as this. Informal modes are extraordinary tools that we can use to expedite and to facilitate with ease our work, but this is not. the usual case. In this particular case we have a shorter document and we do not have to rely on an extraordinary format to consider this given that it is relatively shorter and less difficult and contentious we would like to believe than the longer substantive report. So we just wish to reiterate our strong preference to have consideration of this in a formal setting. Although of course we as a constructive delegation would always support the prerogative and the proposal and the ruling from the Chair if the Chair believes otherwise. Thank you.",1
S4M114,4,9,Russia,"Thank you, Chairman. Perhaps it's just our delegation that has some kind of misunderstanding about exactly what we agreed yesterday in the closed informal consultations. I say that China has also referred to it. As far as we are concerned, it's absolutely clear that yesterday we did not agree to prepare any procedural, any draft procedural report. At least our delegation did not agree to that. and we consider this Chairman as being your proposal to continue work in that direction. As far as we're concerned, this draft report... is not procedural or non-procedural. It's a report from the group and that is the heading on CRP2, draft report, it says. It can be procedural, it can be more substantive. That's up to us to decide. The Russian Federation at this stage can say one thing clearly and specifically. To quit, If delegations insist on continuing work on the draft report in a formal plenary session, then our delegation will be prepared to participate in that work. But in that case, we will then be talking about a really substantive discussion. in order so as not to waste the three, four actually, days of informal discussions discussing the previous version of the draft report, suddenly then opening up a formal plenary session to discuss some shortened version of the report. Well, our delegation did not agree to that, even if that work is done. Furthermore, We operate here Chairman as you know on the basis of consensus. At this stage, taking into account the differences and the divergences which exist in this room about the continuation of future work, we would suggest a pause in the meeting and to discuss this issue separately in informal consultations with you and other delegations that might be interested. If we don't do something like that, I feel that the work on the draft report would be very, very difficult, especially given the misunderstandings which appear to have arisen for our delegation and indeed for other delegations, and probably bearing in mind the comments I've held among quite a few other delegations here in this room too. Thank you for your attention.",1
S4M116,4,9,United Kingdom,"Thank you Mr Chair, good morning and good morning to all colleagues. Thank you once again for the work that you and your team did overnight. There is no confusion in the mind of my delegation and my delegation was of the understanding that all who participated in the informal consultations that you convened yesterday Mr Chair were of the same view. And that was that we are mandated by the resolution to prepare a report for the General Assembly at its 78th session, that there was no prospect of containing any substance in that report for reasons that the distinguished delegates of the Russian Federation will be well aware, and that we were going to then limit the report that we're mandated to produce to a strictly procedural summary of the work that we had done to fulfill our mandate. That was our understanding. We understood that to be the understanding of every other delegation in that room. And as the distinguished delegate of the Philippines has said, that is standard practice across all UN proceedings. So we support your proposed way forward, Mr. Chair, and we're rather mystified that there should be any debate about this. Thank you.",1
S4M118,4,9,China,"The President There was a conclusion that was reached. There was no consensus reached, if not a conclusion. Let me rephrase. I remember that the Canadian delegate said something to the effect. The only consensus that was reached was that there was no consensus. I also recall that you said, Mr Chair. that. There will be no report. as for how we proceed with the procedural report. whether in a formal or informal setting. I don't think it's necessary to debate on this issue. The form is not important. Thank you, Chair.",2
S4M120,4,9,Australia,"Thank you very much, Chair, and good morning, everyone. Let me first begin by thanking you again, Chair, for your leadership and your very clear guidance to us on your intentions and for the quick work on the procedural draft report. I have to confess, I feel that I'm a sense of bewilderment, which is one I have felt at other times during this week, that we're having this discussion. You've been very clear on your intentions to work on a procedural report at this point. That really is the only option forward for us in light of the situation we found ourselves in yesterday, which was very clear in the informal discussions that there is no prospect for a substantive report. I can only echo the comments of others that this is of course entirely standard procedure for these sorts of groups. We have a mandate to produce a report. My delegation has come here today to do just that. to work on the draft procedural report you have prepared. We also support your intention to produce a summary under your own authority. I think that is an excellent way forward at this point to capture some of the richness of the discussions that have been had here. So we support that way forward. We hope that we can wrap up this conversation very quickly. I did not wanna add to it, but I felt compelled to recall this standard practice as others have done. My delegation is happy to have that in any setting that you deem appropriate. We're certainly happy to have that discussion in a formal setting, but I do hope, Chair, that we can get on with the business of discussing the procedural report as soon as possible. Thank you.",1
S4M122,4,9,Japan,"Thank you very much for giving me the floor. you propose to guide us on these papers. I think it is the only option which is left taking into account of what has happened until yesterday. I think it is a logical conclusion that your proposal is a logical conclusion. So we have to follow that. And also, this group is fully mandated by the UNJ. solutions to make a report to the UNGA so we have to fulfill that mandate. And also your idea to present the draft summary as your own working paper is quite a reasonable option under these circumstances. So I would like to fully support your idea of presenting your chair summary as your working So it is the established practice of our exercises. Thank you very much.",2
S4M124,4,9,Canada,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'll be brief, as I don't think this is a debate that warrants a great deal of our time. I just wanted to clarify my remarks yesterday that I made in our small group consultation for the benefit of the room. I did say that the only consensus that we seemed to reach was that there was no consensus on the draft report. But my remarks were confined to the substantive report to which we had been discussing up until now. It was not a reflection of how I felt about a procedural report. I'm fully supportive of the production of one. I think at a bare minimum we owe something to the General Assembly who, you know, through over 150 votes, supported this resolution. At a bare minimum, resources have been spent to convene this group over the course of four weeks over the last year or so. And I think we have to account for what we did with those resources. And even if at all the minimum we can produce is something that says we met and we discussed this mandate, I think that that's something of value that needs to be accounted for. Thank you very much.",2
S4M126,4,9,South Korea,"Thank you, Chair. I just also felt compelled to take the floor because quite surprisingly some delegations have a difficult recollection of what happened in there and I think human memory can be deceptive. So I just took a look at my notes from yesterday where actually I had a clear last sentence that says, Chair's report will not be a consensus and I said procedural report. actually you have clearly mentioned that there will be two things. There will be a chair's report which will not be a consensus and produced under your sole responsibility and there will be a procedural report. And just like as the delegation from Canada has just mentioned, and I think we actually owe this, our general assembly who has mandated us to work in this working group. And actually, if we recall the paragraph from the resolution that has mandated us, it said that it decides that the open-ended group shall work on the basis of consensus, hold its organizations, and meet, so it has actually mandated us to do things. And I think we bear responsibility to actually explain what we have done. And as the Canadian delegations have said, there is also the... UN budget that has gone into this process. So we actually clearly see the merit of the procedural report, not to mention that it's a long-standing practice within the UN when there is no consensus on a substantive thing we produce procedural reports, as we did in Paris GGE. Thank you.",1
S4M128,4,9,Chile,"Thank you, Chairman. To start with, my delegation would like to thank you for your leadership and for your persistence in running these discussions. At the same time, we regret that it has not been possible to build consensus on the draft report of the Open Ended Working Group on Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviors. However, We take note of and support your decision to submit a chairs report and we support what has been said by the Republic of Korea, Canada and other delegations who have supported having a procedural report on what we have done in order to comply with the mandate we received from the UN General Assembly. We think this will make it possible for us to pick up the observations which are made in the course of the discussions. continue through multilateral dialogue with gradually making headway towards agreements which will enable us to guarantee the sustainability and safety of work in space. We welcome the report that you will be producing under your own authority. Thank you.",1
S4M130,4,9,France,"Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, everybody. I will keep it very brief. I just offer my full support to the way in which you have suggested that we carry out our work this morning and this afternoon. I endorse your proposal on having a procedural report. This is the normal procedure that we follow. If I recall correctly, yesterday in the small group meeting, several delegations, including the delegation of China, were well aware of that and fully understood the procedure. So I'm a little surprised now to see that this procedural report, which is normal practice, is coming up against opposition. Another one of my recollections from yesterday's meeting was a very relevant remark made by the Philippines delegation. And it was mentioned by Canada too just a couple of minutes ago here. And that's the question of the respect which we owe to the United Nations General Assembly. That respect requires us to submit some kind of report to them. Thank you.",2
S4M132,4,9,Switzerland,"Thank you, Chairman. The previous speaker said he was somewhat mystified or a previous speaker said he was somewhat mystified and Being mystified is something that happens to our delegation on quite a regular basis too. We were not able to participate in the small limited group yesterday afternoon, so we can't really issue any opinion on what was said or done or understood there. However, having said that, the fact that we are intending to adopt at the very least a procedural report... and the resolution that set up this open-ended working group said we had to give in a report is a standard practice in any procedure mandated by the General Assembly. I do not recall when any such process has been unable to adopt at the very least a procedural report. If we were to be unable here to do so, I think... we would be setting a precedent. a precedent which could have consequences that would go way beyond this working group. Therefore we support the approach which you, Chairman, have outlined in order to bring to a swift conclusion as possible the work of this open-ended working group today. Thank you.",1
S4M134,4,9,Syria,"Thank you Mr Chair. I'd like to thank you for holding this meeting. and for your keenness to bring our work under the Open Ender Working Group in this session to a fruitful conclusion and to a consensus amongst the Member States. It is evident for our delegation, Mr. Chair, that there is a difference of opinion as regards the way forward. as regards going forward with the work of the open-ended working group. in which case we are used to going back to the mandate given by the General Assembly to such processes that is General Assembly Resolution 76 over 2031. It is clear and it's in paragraph 5D. the resolution calls for submitting a report to the General Assembly. in the 78th session of the General Assembly. the resolution did not specify whether the report should be substantive or procedural. And at the same time, that resolution stipulates that we would work, we should work on the basis of consensus. That was evident during the consultations that took place until yesterday. that such consensus on the draft report by the working group has not been achieved. The second point that I wish to point out is the chairs summary. Once again thank you very much for clarifying that the chairs summary would be a working group, a working paper rather. amongst the documents of the working group, consequently. This paper will be presented when the working group plenary is held. and Once the session, the fourth session of the working group is over, it will be over, that paper. The third point is... if the working group wishes to continue. negotiating over the draft report. then an informal setting with a working group would give an opportunity to member states to engage transparently with a view to reaching a consensus on the proposed report. This is our established practice. since the beginning of the current session. given the fact that an informal setting gives a wider opportunity for reaching understanding. And thank you, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M136,4,9,Brazil,"Our delegation too is very supportive of the proposal, proposed course of action that you have presented to us this morning. We are, we cannot deny that there is a profound disagreement on substantive matters. It was evident throughout this week and particularly yesterday, but it is the view of my delegation that a procedure report must be presented to the General Assembly. This has been mandated upon us. This is a mandate that was bestowed upon us by the General Assembly and that we cannot ignore. This also has been the course of action that has been followed by GGEs and OEWGs established by the UNGA for many years. And we share the concerns that were expressed by the Swiss delegation about the precedent that we might be setting if we might deviate from that course of action.",2
S4M137,4,9,China,"Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Chair. The President The President My Distinguished delegate from the Republic of Korea In her first sentence, she said that human memory may be deceptive. The President The President Any other business should not hamper our efforts to conduct discussion that is underway now. My understanding is that our current controversy is that first... Do we need, whether we need a procedural report? Second point. whether the meeting should be conducted in an informal setting or formal setting. I think we should address the second point first. because when the second point is addressed, will it be possible, will it help us to discuss the first point? Any other business Any other business I thank the distinguished representative of China and give the floor to the distinguished representative of Singapore.",2
S4M138,4,9,Singapore,"Gracias, Senor Presidente. I will be brief. My dedication fully supports your proposed way forward in view of the lack of consensus on the substantive report, as was evident and clear from the small group meeting yesterday. Thank you. Gracias.",2
S4M140,4,9,Cuba,"Thank you Chair, good morning colleagues. I'll be very brief because time is money. From the very beginning we were planning to start in the discussions, but after participating in your consultations, my delegation believe that you'll be producing a paper under your responsibility. and we heard you say the same here in the room. Also, it is clear that there are differences that prevented us from having a substantive reform and there are fundamental differences in points of views. According to our recollection of the meetings, there were... no discussions related to the procedural report. I think the confusion is here in the room and I agree fully with Canada. We do not need to spend more time to discuss this. Let us clarify existing doubts related to the final procedures. Let's do that without delay. We are convinced that in a brief, informal session we'll be able to achieve an agreement. Thank you.",2
S4M142,4,9,Nicaragua,"Thank you, Chair. Nicaragua joins the concerns that were raised by the distinguished delegation of the Russian Federation, Syria, and China. We believe that this document requires further consideration and more discussions, and we recall that any report that comes out of this document is not a report of the United States work of the working group should be based on consensus in line with the mandate of the UN General Assembly. In this respect, we support the proposal made by the Russian Federation to suspend the meeting and to continue our work in an informal session. Thank you.",1
S4M144,4,9,Venezuela,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. My delegation was somewhat confused. It seemed that the discussions that we were having were aimed at to clarify the understandings that were reached during the informal consultations that took place yesterday and we did not participate. And it's difficult for my country to talk about a discussion that we didn't participate and we've heard the concerns raised by delegations related to the report that was presented yesterday afternoon. Now, we've been working in informal sessions since Tuesday and inform them. sessions as we all know give delegations a possibility to reach agreement quicker therefore we have made a statement under item five because my delegation understood that on agenda item seven there were no formal discussions that were opened now the question of the report question that requires a solution for me for my delegation to simply present a report for the sake of presenting, it is not the most elegant solution. And if we look at the different precedents, we know that such precedents do exist. And I do thank the Republic of Korea and Canada for their comments. Money was invested in these meetings. It's more than $147,000 from the budget. So my delegation would like to ensure that we take into account that delegation... that countries like my own, where financial resources are blocked due to unilateral course of measures, we have to have some justification when we talk to capital that we had all of these sessions and that we should have a minimum level of agreement in the working group that we spent some money on. haven't been able to reach an agreement. This is why we participated in actively in the consultation. So we support the proposal made by Cuba to move to an informal session so we can achieve progress quickly. Thank you.",2
S4M146,4,9,Mexico,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'll be very brief. Simply to support the proposal that you made, we believe that first as an exercise of accountability to our General Assembly, we have to agree that there were no agreements. on some questions of substance but we are completing our work and we are reflecting the discussions that took place in different meetings and we believe that perhaps we should try to avoid a negative precedent. if the General Assembly does not receive this type of report and like to support your proposal for a chairperson's summary so that we have some reflection of the substantive elements that were discussed in this session under the exclusive responsibility of the term in it so we do not lose any of these valuable contributions.",2
S4M148,4,9,New Zealand,"Thank you Mr Chair. I will speak only briefly because others have made these same points but because this issue is so important I feel that I have no option but to voice Aotearoa New Zealand's complete support for the approach that you have outlined. This includes discussing and adopting a procedural report whether in an informal or formal session as you see best. We also support your plan to release a summary of discussions under your own authority. Such an approach is an established and an essential practice of multilateral processes. As others have stated, it is also necessary to fulfil our mandate delivered to us under the UN General Assembly, notwithstanding that current discussions were not able to reach a consensus report, as I am sure every delegation in this room had hoped for. And such a report can only help but to inform future discussions on these important issues. I hope that we can continue with your planned way forward without delay. Thank you Mr Chair.",1
S4M150,4,9,Netherlands,"Let me also be brief, three points. It was clear that there was, and that's probably the only consensus we have at this moment in the room, that there was no consensus on the substantive report yesterday in the informal consultations. But we have to move ahead now. And then let me make three remarks. It's indeed, as also the distinguished representative of New Zealand said, that it is an established practice once we cannot agree on a substantive document, we try to have a procedural report. Also to live up to the expectations within the United Nations General Assembly. But mandated this body. Second, we see no added value in going into informal discussions now. So we support your approach to do this in a formal setting. And last but not least, number three, we consider the prerogative of the chair to submit a report on his own behalf, reflecting the discussion that took place. Thank you very much.",1
S4M152,4,9,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Also, I would try to be brief, but I would respond in an interactive fashion to some of the comments that have been expressed. First of all, on the Chair's summary, that is completely your business, and I think we will follow whatever you think is appropriate and how you would proceed with that. Second, our business is to heed the command of the General Assembly, given that we are a subsidiary body to the General Assembly. to submit a report. The mandate given to us is to submit a report. And while we do so, we operate on the basis of consensus. To fulfill that, we have two options. Submit a substantive report which is the ideal, or submit a procedural report which is the minimum. Obviously the uh... we had consensus to go to an informal mode because we wanted to have a higher level of ambition on the report but it is clear that there is no consensus and we will now go to the minimum the procedural report The procedural report as the minimum level of report is something that we need to submit whether this body likes it or not. Submitting a report is not subject to our consensus here because this is a decision imposed upon us by a higher body, which is the General Assembly. So therefore, I cannot accept that there is an issue on whether we would submit a procedural report or not. That is not the issue because this issue is resolved by the mandate of the General Assembly. Regarding the modality of how we would proceed, we struggle to understand why we would need an informal setting because if we are going to consider a procedural report, as it is clear that we don't have the consensus to go beyond a procedural report, Why do we need an informal session? The procedural draft that you circulated is clear, concise, and straightforward. It says this group met, and this group elected the chair, and this group discussed matters in accordance with the mandate, even reflecting the language of the mandate of the resolution. Why do we need an informal? But if the informal is needed for some minor tweaking of the text, fine, we can go along with having an informal session, maybe you can suspend the meeting for an hour and work on some minor tweaking of the draft. But it would be excessive to have a long informal session where other stakeholders will not be here to see us decide on something really simple. This really goes against the spirit of this OEWG which is to promote inclusivity and the participation of all stakeholders. We can agree to an informal manner if you need some minor tweaks in the draft, but if the informal meeting is going to be conducted to decide whether or not we will submit a procedural report, we cannot agree because we have no competence to make that decision. And the last point I wish to make Mr. Chair, I think we have been discussing this too long. You have the power under Rule 35 to make a ruling and decide which... way you think would be the best way forward for the group and we would submit to your leadership. Thank you Mr. Chair.",1
S4M12,4,10,Philippines (Multi Country),"I have the honor to take the floor on behalf of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malawi. Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, my country the Philippines, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Samoa, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. While we could not adopt a substantive report in accordance with the mandate of the Open Ended Working Group on reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior, we nevertheless thank you and your team for the excellent, fair, and balanced manner with which we have led this process. We welcome that 34 states delivered a joint statement in support of the OEWG. which has now been submitted officially as a working paper. We reiterate our appreciation for the OEWG process, which has inspired open, substantive, interactive, and enlightening discussions pertaining to outer space security. The OEWG has proven itself as a constructive platform for an inclusive dialogue among Member States with the participation of all relevant stakeholders on reducing space threats. including this week, have demonstrated a significant interest among States in finding converging views on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors. We continue to reaffirm that political commitments on responsible behaviors can be developed in support of, and without prejudice to, the pursuit of legally binding measures and instruments in this area. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive. The work we have done in this OEWG is an excellent starting point that complements other efforts relating to enhancing outer space security, including the newly established group of government experts on further measures on preventing an arms race in outer space. A follow-up process to this ongoing OEWG aimed at further convergence between these tracks would be useful. The inclusive nature of this process, in terms of both participation of stakeholders and the range of issues and measures that could be discussed, makes it an invaluable platform that ensures that the voices of all Member States and relevant stakeholders are heard on an issue that affects us all. Our delegations will continue to work on these matters constructively beyond this OEWG. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M14,4,10,Brazil,"Thank you Mr Chairman. My delegation associates itself with the joint statement delivered by the delegation of the Philippines on behalf of the Friends of the OEWG, who wish to add the following points on our national capacity. My delegation deeply regrets that we have arrived at the end of this exercise without being able to adopt by consensus a substantive report. Notwithstanding this, we are of the firm belief that this open-ended working group has been a success, thanks to your able and competent leadership. Regardless of the position countries find themselves in the spectrum of space capabilities, every delegation has benefited from this exercise. We owe you and your dedicated team a debt of gratitude for the skill, dedication, and fairness with which you have steered this process. Throughout these four sessions, we had invaluable opportunities to listen to the opinion of renowned experts, to discuss all aspects of space security, and to work together to build common understandings on norms for state behavior as a foundation for much needed progress on strengthening the legal framework. But most of all, the OEWG provided the first opportunity for all member states to share their concerns about space security, concerns that had long been stifled due to the lack of a forum with a specific mandate to discuss those issues. The ample engagement throughout these two years confirmed that space security is not an exclusive domain for major spacefaring nations. All states are already being affected by the escalation of tensions in space. Moreover, it emerged clearly that developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the deterioration of the safety and security situation in space, and that the borders between these two concepts are becoming increasingly porous. The conclusion is crystal clear. This process cannot and will not end today. We look forward to discussions during the upcoming session of the General Assembly on how to ensure its continuation. The way forward is more, nor less, engagement. Mr Chairman, out of this OEWG, my delegation wishes to highlight three main takeaways. The first is that there is wide or even universal agreement on the ultimate objective of preventing an arms race in outer space and on its relevance and increased urgency. The second takeaway is that the longstanding fundamental disagreements on the ways and to achieve that ultimate objective remain just as entrenched. The third takeaway, which is a logical corollary of the first two, is that although there is convergence on the final objective to achieve Paros, we need to resort to alternative approaches in the meantime to address pressing challenges in the space environment. The reiteration of traditional positions, some dating four decades, Some even hold the view that the perpetuation of the status quo comes to their benefit. They could not be more wrong. Mr. Chairman, in our opening remarks this week, we expressed the hope that the results of this OEWG become a firm basis for the negotiation of a legally binding instrument on Paros, and that channeling the results of our work towards the upcoming GGE on Paros is the most promising avenue to ensure that goal. The lack of substantive report has not changed that assessment. confident that complementarity and mutually reinforcing dynamics between these two fora is the only realistic way for those genuinely committed to progress towards Paros. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",1
S4M16,4,10,Australia,"Thank you very much Chair. First let me thank you, the Secretariat and of course the interpreters for your tireless work over the four sessions and intercessionally to facilitate the Open Ended Working Group. Australia was very pleased to align with both the joint statements delivered this week on behalf of a large number of States and we fully support the views expressed therein. I'd like to add some further comments in our national capacity. Like many in this room, Australia is disappointed that we could not reach consensus on a report. But for us, and I think for many others in the room, the process itself represents a valuable outcome. We have engaged in very rich discussions during the course of the working group, capturing a diversity of views. And we have done so in an inclusive and open manner. As a result, we now have a wealth of statements. working and conference room papers, and expert presentations to draw upon going forward. Chair, PARIS is our shared goal in this endeavour. To be effective in reaching that goal, we must respond to the complexity of the space environment as it now exists, and the nature of the contemporary space security threats we are now seeing. To do this, we must explore the full suite of measures at our disposal. including political commitments and legally binding instruments. As discussions during the course of this open-ended working group have shown, adopting an approach to this work that focuses on behaviours has many benefits in the dual-use environment of space. Taking a behavioural approach allows us to define what actions we don't want to see occur. Importantly, a focus on actions, activities and emissions is the most effective approach in a domain in which technologies and capabilities are developing at a rapid pace. For these reasons, responsible behaviours will be an important part of any future space security treaties. Developing norms and principles around these behaviours is our first task. This has been the traditional pathway for many legally binding instruments and our discussions here have been an excellent start to this work. So my delegation supports those countries in the joint statement and others in the room calling for further work on these important issues. We thank delegations for the very constructive engagement to date and look forward to further inclusive discussions on these issues. Thank you Chair.",1
S4M18,4,10,EU,"Thank you very much Mr. Chair. The delegation of the European Union associated itself to the joint statement of 34 states delivered a moment ago by the distinguished delegates of the Philippines. We deeply regret that this session has not been able to adopt a consensual substantive report on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior as an outcome of four fruitful sessions of exchanges of view. This inclusive and comprehensive process has allowed a better mutual understanding. And we continue thinking that this is a first and very necessary step on the road towards a legally binding instrument in the future. We will continue work on allowing a... good mutual understanding so as to achieve the ultimate goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. Thank you Mr. Chair.",1
S4M110,4,10,New Zealand,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. My delegation associates itself with a statement delivered just now by the Philippines on behalf of a group of countries. And I wish to make some comments and remarks in a national capacity. As we reach the final moments of this OEWG process, I would like to share again Aotearoa New Zealand's appreciation for the skilled and patient leadership you have provided over the last two years. The elements papers and draft reports that were produced during this working group went a long way towards highlighting key areas of convergence across an evolving, busy and at times challenging conversation. We are certain that these important documents will become part of and will enlighten future discussions on outer space security. We would like as well to thank your wider team and the Secretariat, without whose hard work we would not have been able to take discussions as far as we have done. We thank also our diligent interpreters. Mr Chair, like other delegations, we are disappointed that we will not be able to conclude this two-year process with consensus on a substantive report in accordance with our mandate given to us by the General Assembly. We do not see this process as having failed. In fact, we have seen this important conversation evolve and develop. This demonstrates both the significant and growing interest among states on reducing space threats, including through developing rules, norms, and principles of responsible behaviors. It also demonstrates the value of this OEWG process as an open and inclusive process. which allows for the participation of all states, as well as international organizations. Many aspects of the discussion towards preventing an arms race in outer space had seemed to be in deadlock. Now we have seen encouraging convergence on a number of key issues. This convergence can perhaps be most clearly seen in the joint statement delivered by the Philippines on behalf of 34 states, including Aotearoa New Zealand earlier this week. This statement reaffirmed the applicability of international law to outer space. This includes the UN Charter, key space treaties and international humanitarian law. It also highlighted that elaborating norms or responsible behaviours in space is a useful means towards addressing space threats and that these can be developed in a complementary way to any pursuit of legally binding measures. The joint statement and our discussions also highlight the need to continue this conversation and we look forward to the opportunity to do so. Mr Chair, we recognise that this important conversation would not have moved as far as it has done, nor as fast, without your stewardship. So in closing, we thank the very many delegations who engaged constructively in this OEWG process. We have seen strong efforts to identify... and to find key issues and work towards areas of common ground and consensus. It is our hope and trust that it is this spirit of what we call in the indigenous language of New Zealand mahi tahi, which means working together, that carries on into all future discussions on Paris. Mr. Chair, thank you again for your leadership and for your efforts.",1
S4M112,4,10,China,"The President During the four sessions we've held, we've fully elaborated our positions on relevant issues, and we also enhanced mutual understanding on each other's positions. We commend the Chair and your team for your diligent work. The discussions of the OEWG also demonstrate that on many issues, there's still entrenched divergence, disagreement, or even completely contradictory views on some of the issues. The concept of norms of a responsible behavior have not enjoyed common agreement, the so-called space threats, space systems, and other terminologies, or do not enjoy a broadly agreed understanding. We should discuss whether it is feasible to discuss the applicability of IHL in outer space. There is still disagreement on this issue. We must reflect whether this process can be a means or most effective means to address relevant issues. the objective of international community of apparel has not changed. Ensuring peace and security in outer space should not and cannot stop. Currently, some countries are engaged in military buildup and military expansion in outer space, and the need to address this issue has become more urgent. China has always believed that negotiating and concluding a legally binding instrument to fill the gaps of international law in outer space is the way to go or the only effective way to prevent an arms race in outer space. The OEWG and its discussions further demonstrate that. On the negotiation and conclusion of legal instrument to prevent an arms race in outer space on this objective, all parties have agreement. However, regarding specific scope and specific steps to take, there are still divergent views. China is ready to work with all parties to continue to engage in in-depth discussions within the framework of UN on perils. to negotiate and conclude the element of a legal instrument and engage in in-depth and substantive discussions. We expect the international community to summarize relevant international discussions on the issue of space security, including the discussions held at the city, the DC, the GGE, and today's and summarize relevant successful experience and lessons to be drawn, and coordinate relevant international efforts and proposals from different parties to form the maximum consensus, to jointly promote the multilateral governance on space security, and effectively prevent an arms race in outer space. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S4M114,4,10,Switzerland,"Thank you, Mr President. Thank you, Chairman. To begin with, we should like to thank you for the way in which you have been steering the work of this open-ended working group. Thank you for your commitment and your dedication to doing your job. It is, of course, regrettable that the group has not been able to reach agreement on a final report, but that is not in any way... the result of the way in which this meeting has been run. It is the result of divergent viewpoints between members' days, which can doubt, unfortunately, to be insurmountable. We would like to extend our thanks to the other members of your team as well, and to the Secretariat. I should like to reassure you that I'm going to be brief in this statement, and I'm going to make just three points. The discussions in this working group have demonstrated the added value of a specific open-ended process in which all UN member states and other interested parties can join in order to deal with the issue of reducing space threats. These discussions have made it possible to improve our shared understanding of the threats which exist to security and safety in space, and they've also emphasized the need to find a response to those threats. That is something that remains unchanged, even if we were not able to reach agreement on these various elements. Secondly, our work has highlighted the value added of an approach based on the development of norms, rules and principles on responsible behaviour in space. Such an approach does not of course replace the approach based on capacity or potential which we support, but it is a complement to that and strengthens it and will, we think, contribute to helping us to make progress with it. As discussions in this group have shown, Basing oneself only on an approach focused on capacity will not help us to improve security in space. We regret, therefore, that some delegations have opposed one approach to the other. We fear that the deadlock we have seen in some working groups is going to complicate progress on other processes in different groups, and we do hope that is not going to be the case this time. The work we've done here has highlighted one thing more than anything else perhaps, and that is the fact that it has opened up a major new area of work. Space threats remain unchanged. There are trends which we have identified which indicate that they are going to become increasingly complex over time. Therefore, the establishment of having a follow-up procedure to our work seems to us to be essential. We also need to do a bit of thinking about how a new working group is going to operate, so as to make it easier for any such group to actually achieve conclusive results. Thank you very much, Chairman.",1
S4M116,4,10,Peru,"Thank you, Chairman. I would like to begin by saying that my delegation associates itself fully with the common statement made by the Philippines delegation on behalf of a number of states. And in my national capacity, I have one or two other comments that I would like to make. Peru has participated in this meeting and indeed in previous meetings with the goal of making a contribution to... reaching a consensus-based final report in line with Resolution 76231, which would be robust and help to reduce tensions between states in space and therefore security threats there. And this is absolutely essential at a time of global instability and difference. Despite, however, your extraordinary efforts as Chairman of this open-ended working group, And despite the substantive discussions which we held and the useful exchange of information we had, as well as growing agreement on certain issues, we have not been able to build the consensus that would have been necessary to emerge from this group with, and we regret that very much. Given the general interest of all mankind in making progress on the use of outer space for solely peaceful purposes, we would like to recall... that the space environment should be used for the benefit of all countries, all states and all peoples, whatever country's level of economic and or scientific development. Peru therefore believes that on this particular subject, we should continue in the United Nations to work together in order to further identify areas where we can move towards agreement and new ways of achieving that agreement and our final goal, which is overall improving the governance of activity in outer space. Thank you.",1
S4M118,4,10,France,"Thank you, Chairman. To begin with, I would like to say this, take this opportunity of my closing statement to thank you and congratulate you because with the assistance of the Disarmament Affairs Office, the Secretariat and the United Nations Institute on Disarmament Research done impressive work. You steered our work expertly. You did it skillfully and you showed an intense sense of duty and dedication. in your attempts to bring us to successful conclusions. Alas, we were not able to agree by consensus on a report that is, to put it mildly, regrettable. Some delegations in a very small minority. didn't seem able to contribute to helping us all make progress on the issue of space security, which would have been in the interest of all Member States and would have been to the benefit of our ultimate goal of preventing anomalies in space. this delegation, some of them even tried to stop. this meeting getting to certain conclusions and I think they were in denial of the reality at the time. However, at the same time we have made some progress in that a great number of states have been interested in and involved in the discussion. When you called a small meeting yesterday evening you would have noticed that we had trouble actually all fitting into the room. The Philippines' statements have been supported by 39 states. France was one of them, and that goes a long way to show the rising level of interest in this topic. In that sense, we have all made progress in reaching a better common understanding of the nature of space threats and the perception that different member states have of them. It is clear that all the delegations in this room, even those who opposed an agreed... conclusion to the very, very end have understood the situation better and I hope that will help us to make progress in the future. We have made some movement. We will continue to contribute to our common work in the hope that we achieve a better outcome next time. Thank you, Chairman, for your efforts and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, from other delegations for your cooperation and involvement. Thank you.",1
S4M120,4,10,Japan,"Mr. Chair, first of all, my delegation would like to express our sincere appreciation for your effective leadership in skillfully guiding us throughout the discussions at the open working group or reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior. I would like to thank also members of your team who helped us in the most efficient way throughout our activities. Also, I am delighted that my delegation could fully align itself with the joint statement delivered by the representative of the Philippines on behalf of a large cross-regional group, which strongly supported our common endeavor towards norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior as well as the work of this working group, which should be, in our views, properly followed up. Thanks to your excellent guidances, we found the forum of this working group to be inclusive, interactive and meaningful, as it enabled us to engage in deep discussions on substantial matters, including through panel discussions. While it was regrettable that no consensus was reached on the substantial report and even on the procedural one, we are deeply concerned that that this deviation from the established practice of open working group activities based upon UN General Assembly resolutions and constitute a precedent to the J.J. Paros in November this year. Now Japan considers it is are to be of utmost importance for us not to stop here, but to continue working on further considerations on norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors and engaging in any related efforts to develop them, building upon the discussion at this working group. In this light, we look forward to the Chair's summary. which we believe will constitute a valuable contribution to future discussions and initiatives on this issue. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Japan is ready to constructively contribute to advancing our work with all UN member states in order to reduce threats to space systems through the further development of norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors and to prevent an arms race in outer space. I thank you, Mr. Chair, for your kind attention.",1
S4M122,4,10,South Korea,"Mr. Chair, looking back the intense discussions we had last four sessions, it is truly regrettable that we were not able to agree on a consensus report. Nonetheless, the lack of consensus cannot overshadow the fact that we had a very useful discussion within the OEWG. Let me spell out that again. Open-ended working group on reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors. as highlighted by the joint statement delivered by the delegation from the Philippines on behalf of so many of us in the room. We worked in one spirit to see what are the gaps in existing international framework pertaining to space security and discuss the areas where we see the urgent need to address the gap. We made vigorous efforts to identify areas of convergence. We were also able to make our collective voice heard on the issues of concern. I have every confidence that the rich discussions we had would be well captured in your report. Mr. Chair, in spite of different views and priorities, no one can deny the values and benefits of the OEWG as an indispensable platform for an inclusive dialogue among all relevant stakeholders. Our work must go on to demonstrate our enduring commitment to reducing space threats and enhancing the security and security of the OEWG. stability and sustainability of space. The Republic of Korea has firm confidence that our collective efforts toward defining threats and responsible behaviors will serve as meaningful stepping stones toward a creation of legally binding norms in the area of space security. We should continue to work together to make progress. Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my deep appreciation to you, Mr. Chair. and the Secretariat for the hard work to lead this important meeting. Thank you.",1
S4M124,4,10,Netherlands,"Mr. Chair, thank you for giving me the floor. And I would like to start by expressing our deep-felt gratitude to you, Mr. Chair, and to your team. I also would like to thank the interpreters for their work, without which we cannot engage with each other. We thank the Philippines for delivering our joint statement, align ourselves with the statement of the EU, and wish to make the following observations in our national capacity. The Netherlands greatly regrets that we have not been able to agree on a consensus report in accordance with our mandate and everybody present in this room knows why this is the case. We recall this mandate was given to us by the General Assembly. We were proud to be part of the group of 34 nations issuing a joint statement this Monday that has now been submitted as a working paper. We are equally proud to be part of the 39 states on behalf of whom the Philippines just issued a joint statement. The cross-regional nature of those statements indicates that there is, in fact, broad agreement across the various regions of the international community that we should be open to look beyond this open-ended working group and continue working on these matters. Chair, I take this opportunity to emphasize our priorities. First, we consider the mandate important and think that space threats can and will be reduced by developing norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours. This does by no means mean that we do not support the end goal. The end goal, that is, the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Also, this does not mean that we would not support the development of legally binding instruments. In that context, the behaviorist approach, consideration of the principle of due regard, pre-launch notifications and TCBMs are important to the Netherlands. Secondly, we consider that compliance with international law is a sine qua non for the safety and security in outer space, as it is on Earth. Relevant international law includes the five United Nations treaties on outer space. the UN Charter, the Law on State Responsibility and International Humanitarian Law. Third, As to our outlook to the future, despite the somewhat disappointing result of this open-ended working group and the absence of a substantive report, we do think the discussions we have had here in Geneva this week were an achievement. They were inclusive, open and transparent. And we look forward to continuing this work and in that regard we will continue to support an inclusive and multi-stakeholder approach. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M126,4,10,Nigeria,"Thank you. Thank you for giving Nigeria the floor. My delegation aligns with the statement made by the Philippines on behalf of 39 states and wishes to make few comments in national capacity. Chair, as my delegation takes the floor for the first time during the concluding session of the work of the OEWG on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors, allow me to commend you. and the manner in which you have stared this process since inception. My delegation further wishes to appreciate the inclusive nature of the OEWG, which availed all stakeholders, including developing countries, the opportunity to register their views and concerns on the conduct of space-related activities. In previous sessions of the OEWG, my delegation participated constructively sharing views on various aspects of prevailing discussions. Having reached the conclusion of this OEWG, and cognizant of the report prepared by the chair, my delegation wishes to acknowledge the attempt of the chair to balance all views and concerns in the most pragmatic manner, and regrets that this process was unable to reach consensus to adopt both a substantive or procedural outcome document. However, we also took note of the concerns raised by several delegations on the non-reflection of their comments and proposals. Nonetheless, my delegation is aware of the difficulties associated with trying to balance the opinions and views of all stakeholders. This unfortunate reality further stresses the need for flexibility and the demonstration of political will by member states. Mr. Chair, my delegation wishes to seize this opportunity to highlight one key aspect of your initial report, which we found to be quite consistent with our interests. The significance of due regard in relation to space-related activities, as reflected in what is now to be hopefully called the Chair's summary, remains of great importance to my delegation. We are of the view that the concept of due regard is of utmost importance to developing states and should be upheld in these discussions even beyond the work of this OEWG, particularly as it takes into account the balancing of interests and the prevention of misunderstandings that could result in conflicts between states. In conclusion, Mr Chair, my delegation welcomes the Chair's intention to prepare. a summary of the proceedings of the OEWG on reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors. We reiterate our commitment to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, as well as the establishment of a legally binding instrument on Paris. And we look forward to future dialogue on these. I thank you.",1
S4M128,4,10,Canada,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'll keep this short as what I have to say echoes the comments of many others that have already spoken. First, we would like to thank you and the Secretariat for all of your efforts over this session and the previous ones to make this working group a success. You have had the unenviable task of trying to reconcile very divergent views, and we recognize that you have done your very best. We fully align ourselves with the statement delivered by the Philippines on behalf of a growing number of states. It is great to see that the events of the last few days have only reinforced the value of the Responsible Behaviors approach that this group has been mandated to advance. Although we are disappointed in the outcome, we do nonetheless feel much has been achieved. The value of this process is self-evident by the broad engagement of a number of states as well as the participation of civil society. We all share the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. And we are appreciative of the increasing recognition that there is not just one single way to achieve this. As I mentioned in my opening remarks from earlier this week, the OEWG has concluded, but our work is not over. We greatly hope this forum will continue with the same enthusiastic participation we have seen to date. We look forward to the upcoming GGE process, and I can only assume the discussions will be as engaging and spirited as this one. Thank you once again, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M130,4,10,Iran,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me to join previous speakers in thanking you and your team for excellent work you have done on guiding us through this two-year journey in open-ended working group on reducing threat in outer space. Also, let me to thank the Secretariat and distinguished panelists for their contribution in this process. Their insightful contributions enriched the discussion through the work that we have done in this process. Despite the fact that we casted our vote against the resolution that established this working group, my delegation entered this process with open mind and constructive approach. We clearly elaborated our concern and our expectation from this exercise with the aim of making it a success. It is clear that member states have different perceptions from the threat that emanates from space and space technologies. Space technology should contribute to the development and prosperity of the human being, and it should not compromise the national sovereignty and endanger the national security of the member states. We hope that this process could contribute in our shared goal of creating a legally binding instrument toward the prohibition of an armed race in outer space. Once again, I reiterate that for making a success, this process the main security concerns of member states should be recognized and the aim should be reduced such a threat and we need avoid any selective approach by ignoring the security concerns of some and highlighting the others. Our collective effort toward reducing space threats should be set in a way that addresses the main concern of member states in a balanced manner. In this way, having a clear definition of different dimensions of threat, we should that we are going to reduce is a must. Finally, Mr. Chairman, starting negotiation on prevention of arm race in outer space is a must that should be immediately started in conference on the summons as mandated by SSOD 1. I thank you, Mr. Chapters.",1
S4M132,4,10,Israel,"Thank you, Chair. Israel would like to express its gratitude for the very hard work that was carried out by yourself, your team, and the Secretariat over the last two years, and especially during this past week. The work in the Open Internet Working Group under your leadership. made it possible to have a varied discussion of different points of view and a substantive dialogue with respect to the reduction of threats in outer space. Thank you very much and Shabbat Shalom.",1
S4M134,4,10,Cuba,"Thank you, Chair. We'll try to be as brief as possible. As we are concluding the work of this open-ended working group, I'd like to once again thank you and your team and the Secretariat for the very clear efforts that were carried out, the delegation of Cuba, just like other countries. present in these discussions, participated in the work of the group in good faith and very actively and constructively in the substantive discussions, but also in those related to the final report, all of that, even though Cuba voted against the resolution and we placed on record our substantive reservations. with the question of the focus and rules of responsible behaviors in outer space. From the very first session of this group, we highlighted our priorities that are shared by many delegations. And we really hoped to have at the end a final document that would be balanced and based on consensus. differences that exist but that would contain the minimal elements that are necessary in our work to prevent an arms race in outer space and among those who'd like to highlight the urgent need to launch substantive negotiations on a legally binding instrument on Paris that will include a prohibition on the placement of weapons in outer space and a prohibition on the threat or use of force against space objects. Second, the use of outer space for peaceful purposes to the benefit and interest of all countries regardless of their level of development. And the third main point, the consideration of outer space as a common heritage of mankind. refrain from adopting unilateral course of measures that violate international law that may create obstacles or prevent spatial activities for peaceful purposes of developing countries. We take the Liberty Chair to highlight these elements so that you could take this into account in our work. Mr. Chairman, we were in favor of moving forward in negotiations on Paris. Nevertheless, we also participated constructively in the relevant work on questions of conference building and transparencies, and we see complementarity between the two sets of issues. But... The latter should not become a substitute or precondition or an obstacle in the progress of a step-by-step approach. And also we should remember that we should be focused on binding measures. Mr. Chairman, in the GGE established in line with Resolution 7, T2-250 where? Also, very valuable discussions took place in the context of Paris. A final report was not adopted, unfortunately, by consensus. We do hope that the discussions in the next GGE on Paris will be able to see significant progress. And we'd like to say right away that we are already supporting the very important work of that GGG. We cannot reproduce yet again another failure. Thank you.",1
S4M136,4,10,Venezuela,"Thank you very much, Chairman. We will try to be brief. My delegation aligns itself with the statements of gratitude for the work that you carried out, the work carried out by your team and the Secretariat. My delegation would like to make some additional comments, in addition to what we said earlier today. As we said this morning, my delegation participated in the work of this working group, Good Faith. in a constructive manner and we preserved the position of respect to or for the positions of other delegations in our substantive discussions and also in the discussions that were related to the negotiation of the final report. All of this applied to the fact that we voted against the resolution that created this working group. Also we placed on record our substantive reservations, the focus on the rules, and focus on rules and principles of responsible behaviors in the context of outer space. I did hope to have a final document that would be balanced and substantive and based on consensus that would take into account the work that was carried out, that would have clear and relevant recommendations. Most importantly on the following aspects. First, the urgent need to begin substantive discussions in the CD on a legally binding instrument that would be variable on a multilateral basis on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, Paris. including the prohibition on the placement of weapons in outer space and the prohibition on the threat or use of force against objects in outer space, the consideration of outer space as a common heritage of mankind, the exploration and use of outer space should be only carried out for peaceful purposes. to the benefit of all countries, regardless of the level of economic or scientific development, and without undermining the security of any country. A clear prohibition to create obstacles or illegal restrictions in the form of unilateral course of measures that run against international law, and that can create obstacles for the activities in space for peaceful purposes by developing countries and the full effective and non-discriminatory application of principles and treaties that govern international space law. Mr. Chairman, we'd like to highlight the fact that scientific and technological advances that we've seen through the use of outer space can be diverted to develop unilateral national anti-missile systems or other military systems that may lead to an arms race, especially if we take into account that the legal regime applied to outer space currently is not a sufficient safeguard that outer space will not be militarized and therefore it needs to be strengthened. We agree with the urgent need to prevent outer space from becoming a war fighting. arena and that it should be explored for peaceful purposes and this work should include a ban on the placement of any weapons in outer space. In this respect, my delegation believes within the framework of the work of the group of governmental experts established in line. with resolution of the General Assembly 72-250 that was chaired by the distinguished Ambassador of Brazil, Mr. Patrioto. The significant and valuable progress was achieved during the discussions that took place in 2018-2019. Unfortunately, something that we regret. group was not in a position to adopt a report on the basis of consensus. We do hope that the work of the future, GGE on Paris, will continue along the lines of the discussions that took place in 2018-2019, its documents and other documents and the final report, and we'll be able to achieve significant results. To conclude, I would like to avail ourselves of this opportunity. and we'd like to say something positive and congratulate the government and people of India on the successful mission to the moon Charanjan-3. For the first time in the history of space exploration, India arrived at the south pole of the moon and India contributes to the expanding of our horizons and this should be an inspiration for all countries like my country, those countries that consider outer space as the common heritage of mankind.",4
S4M138,4,10,India,"Thank you Mr Chairman. India's position on the responsible behaviour approach is contained in its explanation of vote on UNGA Resolution 76-231. That has not changed. In spite of its views, India participated substantively in the proceedings. India does not believe that political declarations are substitutes for a legally binding instrument and notes that a group of governmental experts on Paros is expected to meet shortly. I'd like to thank you Mr Chairman, your team and the Secretariat for your efforts, your commitment and your unfailing good humor. You worked very hard and this deserves our appreciation. We'd like to thank all delegations who participated in the proceedings and in ending, my delegation acknowledges gratefully on behalf of the people of India, all those who congratulated us on the success of our lunar mission and extends its good wishes to all. Thank you Mr President.",2
S4M140,4,10,Nicaragua,"Thank you very much, Chair. I would like to extend a fraternal salute to the Government of National Unity to you and to the participants and the Secretariat and your team. We thank everyone for the efforts for organizing the work of the working group. We regret the fact that we were not able to agree on a revised final report. And we have to remember that we urgently need to negotiate and prepare a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. This will be a response to legal gaps and we'll put a ban on the placement and use of weapons in outer space and also will help us fight the use or threat of use of force in outer space. and therefore this will make it possible to carry out activities for peaceful purposes without any restrictions and discrimination to the benefit of all mankind. We highlight the focus on IHL and the resolution of disputes in outer space and the resolution of questions that are within the mandate of COPUS. and the use of the term responsible behavior does not enjoy consensus and perhaps this prevents us from achieving consensus on other issues that can strengthen the legal architecture that governs outer space. We join the common feeling that we need to step up our efforts to start negotiations on a legally binding instrument on Paris as the only way to avoid an arms race in outer space in order to guarantee you the security and transparency in space activities. Thank you.",4
S4M142,4,10,Pakistan,"Thank you Mr. Chair. Allow me to extend our heartfelt gratitude to you for skillfully steering the deliberation of this group over the course of the past two years. While it is true that we were unable to reach a consensus report, let it be abundantly clear that this outcome in no way reflects a deficiency in your leadership. Quite the contrary, your Adept and professional guidance has been instrumental in shaping our discussions for which you merit our highest appreciation. Mr. Chair, it is important to recall that Pakistan abstained from endorsing the resolution that established this open-ended working group. Nevertheless, we chose to engage constructively in the proceedings. At the inception of this endeavor, we articulated the reasons behind our abstention. and I wish to briefly reiterate those, as they have also guided our active participation throughout the course of these two years. First and foremost, we consider the prevention of an arms race in outer space as the paramount objective of our collective efforts. This goal finds its roots in numerous agreed upon documents spanning several decades. The list is extensive, and I will refrain from delving into it at this juncture. We have consistently advocated for advancing negotiations on a legally binding instrument on Paris. Concurrently, we have actively contributed to discussions on non-legally binding measures such as transparency and confidence building measures. We recognize the complementary relationship between the two approaches. Historically, non-legally binding measures have contributed to the development of legally binding instruments. and hold the potential to do so in the future. However, it is crucial to underline that they neither serve as a substitute nor a conditional first step for such binding instruments, nor should they divert our attention from them. We continue to believe that we should immediately launch negotiations on a legally binding instrument on Paris in the conference on disarmament. under the Paris agenda, on which this open-ended working group remained divided throughout our work in these two years and which needs reassessment. Mr. Chair, despite these differences, we worked constructively with you and other delegates to see how our minimum common denominators could be reflected in our report, or how we could reaffirm our shared goals which we had set collectively pertaining to Paris in the past decade. It was unfortunate that our differences prevented this group to arrive at consensus. It is also regrettable that our efforts here have added another chapter to the list of unsuccessful endeavors at advancing the Paris agenda, akin to the group of governmental experts in 2019. Mr Chair, it would be remiss of me not to highlight the benefits derived from our discussions in this open-ended working group. We commend the inclusive nature of this process and have found the conversations to be enlightening. They have provided valuable insights into what activities and development states perceive as threatening and have shed light on the underlying conceptual divergences that we must bridge. Going forward, we hope that we will intensify our efforts to build convergence on the agenda of Paris. and will be able to produce outcomes that are effective in addressing the space security threats. We remain confident that our efforts can bear fruit as long as we are ready to engage with each other based on mutual respect and shared understanding of respective positions. And we also encourage all states to approach the upcoming processes, including the upcoming GGE, with an open and constructive approach. in order to develop consensus on these critical issues being dealt under the Paris agenda. In the end, we would like to thank you once again, your entire team in the Secretariat and UNIDER, as well as the interpreters for their invaluable support and work. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",1
S4M144,4,10,Argentina,"Gracias, señor Presidente. Thank you, Chairman. I will be extremely concise. We endorse the statement made by the Philippines. We would, in addition to that, however, like to express our sincere gratitude to you for your dedication and the intensity of the efforts you've made over the two years of the sessions of this OEWG. This is a very important issue for all our countries and all our peoples, and it is deeply regrettable that we have not been able to reach consensus. However, the documents submitted have been very useful and so have the breadth, width, and detail of discussions. We think your summary contained useful lessons and useful information. The transparent, inclusive, and balanced way in which you have chaired this process over the last year. two years deserves our applause and our deep gratitude. Perhaps I'm going a little bit off the agenda now, but I would like to remind delegations that... Many people here have used Spanish in making their statements, and we salute the delegations who normally would use other languages but who have spoken in Spanish. As an ardent defender of multilingualism, we are very happy and pleased with the efforts you've made. Thank you.",2
S4M146,4,10,Mexico,"Thank you very much, Chairman. The Mexican delegation would like to make a brief statement in its national capacity in complement to the endorsement by Mexico of the statement made by the Philippines. First of all, we would like to acknowledge the transparent, steady, and professional manner in which you chaired our work. It was clear that your task was hard and complicated. You tried to help us to make progress on space security, taking an innovative approach to the issue, and you tried to give us a clear picture of the range of space threats that we face, in addition to the transitional views on this issue that have been sometimes followed in other meetings. Of course, we regret our inability to adopt. We think your initial version was an excellent effort. We do, however, value the work which has been done in this forum. We have reviewed the existing legal framework and parts of other regimes, and this, I think, has shown that the space regime is appropriate. We've also been able to exchange opinions and go into more detail than before, perhaps, on the... systems we have to ensure security in space and other systems in other areas which may not be the same but which is certainly complementary. We need to work in a complementary way side by side with other organisations such as the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space without of course causing overlapping or duplication. Given the incredibly rapid development of the use of outer space, we are going to continue to have an expanding range of space threats to tackle. We've got those already which are pending, which urgently need to be tackled, but there are going to be others. We've already identified some of them, which are going to require a different approach and a different viewpoint to them and on them if we are going to deal with them. This perhaps explains the growing interest on the part of nearly all members of the international community in this issue. Many countries, many parties are already involved in the use of space, and many will be in the future. So we need to prevent an arms race in space, prevent conflict, protect mankind, and ensure that we use space solely for peaceful purposes. With this in mind, the Mexican delegation is committed to continuing future work. if the General Assembly decides to add to the mandate of this working group. We think our approach to space security should be complementary with work being done elsewhere and with the preparation of an internationally legally binding instrument on preventing an arms race in space. Thank you very much. And a safe trip home, everyone.",4
S4M148,4,10,Thailand,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will try to be brief. Thailand wishes to join our delegation in thanking you and your team for the hard work and commitments during these two years. Like other delegation here, Thailand has been participating in the OEWG and which to reiterate its appreciation to the OEWG process, the open and constructive process that enhances space security in a corrective manner. Mr. Chair, it is our belief that the exploration and use should be served only for the peaceful use and the socio-economic benefit without any discrimination. Thailand will continue to work with our stakeholders and to join the effort in preventing an armed race in outer space in the future. Thank you so much.",1
S4M149,4,10,Germany,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor and I will be brief as well. My country associates itself with a statement of the European Union and the joint statement delivered by the distinguished representative of the Philippines on behalf of 39 states. And I would like to add some further comments in my national capacity. During this week we have heard many interesting views. on how norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors can contribute to addressing space threats and preventing an arms race in outer space. We express our disappointment that the working group was unable to reach consensus on a final, substantial, or even procedural report, something my delegation has worked towards to and strongly hoped for. But it was nonetheless a very useful work that we have done and that tied us together. We trust the Chair to reflect this broad range of topics and opinions expressed at the sessions in the report or under his sole responsibility. My main takeaways from this working group are, first, It is paramount to recognize that norms, roots, and principles of responsible behaviors are useful means for addressing space threats. This concept, together with other parallel processes, is contributing to one overarching goal that is very dear to us, preventing an arms race in outer space. Second, in the course of our discussions, we identified some area of convergence. That means areas states are mostly concerned about and which accordingly deserve further consideration. In our view, these areas include, but are not limited to, the destruction of space object, the interference with the normal and safe operation of space object, and the protection of critical space-based services to civilians. We would like to see more work done in further framing the general concept and highlighting the value of norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors, as well as discussing the more specific areas I have mentioned. In this spirit, a follow-up process. Inclusive both in format and in substance to this working group would be instrumental and certainly gets the support of my country. Mr. Chair, once again my highest appreciation to you and your ABLE team for all the tireless work you have done. We especially value the fact that you always acted patiently, in good faith, and you always and made many honest attempts to pave the way for consensus and to make tangible progress during the course of this working group. Thank you.",1
S4M151,4,10,Sweden,"Thank you, Chair. I'll try to be brief. Sweden would like to thank you, as well as the members of your team, for your hard work and commitment to help us fulfill our mandate. We appreciate the very able way in which you have conducted the work during our sessions. We fully align with the EU statement and the statement delivered by the Philippines on behalf of 39 states representing different regions and nations at different stages of their development of space activities. In our national capacity, we would like to make a couple of brief comments. We sincerely regret that we have not been able to reach consensus on a report during this session. However, we deeply value the work which has been done in this forum, and we believe that the inclusive method of work supports our view that multilateral discussions on space security involving a broad range of stakeholders providing us with knowledge and understanding of our shared challenges and the work ahead of us is essential. Continuing discussions on norms, rules and principles is, in our view, the way forward. Like many other delegations I have highlighted, this has been the path to binding agreements before. We are committed to continue the discussions on the topics raised in this group beyond this working group. I thank you, Chair.",1
S4M153,4,10,Russia,"Thank you very much, Chairman. The Russian Federation would like to extend its gratitude to you and your team for your efforts to achieve substantive results at this open-ended working group. Russia, as the author of several underlying initiatives, the purpose of which is to prevent an arms race in space, has always driven to make a contribution to the protecting of space and keeping it free of weaponry of any kind and preventing space becoming yet another area for military standoffs and increasing tension. Despite the fact that the Russian Federation voted against the General Assembly Resolution objective doubts and concerns about the concept of responsible behaviour in space and the context for preventing an arms race in space, we nonetheless have actively and constructively in the course of four sessions participated in the efforts of this working group. We will be happy to take any step forward to achieve the goal of PAROS, including the setting up of an open-ended working group for the discussion of the most topical issues on the disarmament agenda, so as to develop decisions we can take by consensus. We always ask ourselves questions, for example, why do we have a contribution for the... Why did we make suggestions to this group which were not covered in the resume of the Chairman or in any other document? And that goes for each session. And furthermore, our proposals were not reflected in the final outcome document of the Open Ended Working Group either. In addition to that, the group was not even able to confirm understandings which we reached other disarmament groups and meetings. in the United Nations' organization. We are disappointed that the outcome of the open-ended working group has not been as it could have been. As we can see, the reasons for this are the fact that the concept of responsible behaviour in space was not one that was agreed by consensus. The idea in it is not supported by all member states of the United Nations. We remember very well how the authors of the initiative insisted on including this concept as an instrument of some kind which is there to achieve the goal of preventing an arms race in space, bring positions between member states of the United Nations closer together, help us to overcome disagreement, and to lay down the foundation for negotiations on the development of an international legally binding instrument to prevent an arms race in outer space, including solid guarantees to prevent the first placement of weapons in space, the use of space or the threat of the use of space in space, from space or to space. However, things turned out very differently. our worst fears have turned out to be justified. This initiative has proved in the course of the Open-ended Working Group to have flaws, and indeed those flaws turned out to be fatal. As we have said from the beginning and as the latest discussions have proven, the UK initiative is aimed at undermining the basic principles for the prevention of an arms race in space and are fraught with contradictions in respect to space activity and undermine international security as a whole. Some delegations who pushed this concept have even stated that they are not against the prevention of an arms race in space and the development of an international legal lead binding instrument, but they just want to look at the possibility. stopping the weaponization of outer space. the threat of the use of force in space wasn't discussed at all. This just confirms the fact that the authors of this initiative were not intending to include Resolution 76231. as the draft report of this group or even a reference to the key points in the resolutions on the preventing of an arms race in space. Furthermore, turning to the negotiations on a legally binding instrument with solid guarantees and the non-placement of weapons in space, the refusal to use force or the threat of force against space objects or with their assistance. There was no clear reference in the document to the concept of responsible behaviour in space and how that would contribute to achieving the goal of power. The basic emphasis was placed differently. and then on fighting the problem of space debris and dealing with other aspects of enhancing sustainability and safety of space operations. We would like to recall that considering these issues is something that the UN Space Committee is already doing quite successfully. Instead of focusing on the real problems we face with achieving powers, and leaving peaceful space activity to be something dealt with by corpos, the states who drove this concept of so-called responsible behavior spared no effort to set up an alternative track for the discussion of the problem. It was really a case of trying to hijack the authority and responsibility of the UN Space Committee. From the point of view of enhancing predictability and security and safety of space activity, Resolution 76231 is superfluous. It deals with questions such as space debris, security of space operations, and that's the subject for discussion in the working group. And that is where the work in that format on that will be done. In this connection, we would like to underscore that it is not appropriate to ignore the competence of the decision-making process there, and if doing so, that would undermine its basic role, which is to strengthen the regime of the – again, to it by the UN General Assembly. What is in Resolution 76231? The approach there takes away some of the substance of the work of COPAs and its subsidiary bodies, and it also weakens its key role in discussing the space agenda. Discussions in the first committee of the UN General Assembly are held aside from Paris negotiations on space from 1967. All this is fought with very serious negative consequences for the achievement of the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. Therefore, the result of the work of the group has confirmed that the activity in which we have engaged has not only failed to promote bringing the positions of various UN member states closer together, it has achieved the exact opposite. We have now got a very serious split on fundamental aspects of powers between member states here. Instead of this being a place which would bring the members of the international community closer together in terms of achieving powers, what this committee has actually done has split its member states apart on virtually every aspect of what was supposed to be discussed under its mandate. That happened in the session of the group and in the informal consultations on the final outcome document. All that proves just one thing, that the concept of responsible behaviour in space is not something that brings us closer together. It does not help us to achieve the task set for this committee. In the course of this session. several delegations quite openly and unashamedly stated that the work on adopting the concept of responsible behaviour in space was a prerequisite for the possible starting of negotiations on any... to increase security in space. and that before achieving the task of paras. and not necessarily looking at the achievement of her goal on Paris. It is clear that preventing weaponization of outer space in this format was not something for discussion. The International Initiative on Non-First Placement of Weapons in Space was discriminated against and ignored in the draft final report, as were other constructive proposals which were tabled for it by the Russian Federation, and the purpose of which was to bring this concept and I'm talking here about the concept of responsible behaviour in space into the discussion on the preventing of an arms race in outer space. Is this not an eloquent confirmation? of the fact that the concept of responsible behaviour in space is inappropriate and does not work. As indicated by the discussion, the result that we've achieved is actually in direct contradiction to the goal we were supposed to be achieving. Instead, as I said, of bringing states' positions closer together and promoting as getting closer to achieving Paris and developing a legally binding instrument on the subject, including the prevention of the deployment of weapons in space, the use of force or the threat of the use of force against space objects. The discussion here has simply undermined the constructive work that could have been done in order to achieve those objectives. our attempt to have solid guarantees for the development of space free of weapons, which would have been included in an international legally binding instrument on achieving Paris. We believe. that this attempt to discuss this concept is more than enough. The negative consequences to which this could lead if we were to do that again would divide the international community even more on crucial issues of international peace and security, and it would simply take us further away from achieving the goals of the UN General Assembly on disarmament set forth in 1975. And that includes research in and the use of space for peaceful purposes, preventing an arms race in outer space and launching the appropriate negotiations, which were stipulated in 1967. The negative outcome of this OEWG speaks for itself. We do not share and do not support the proposals tabled by some delegations to resume this process in the near future. Once again I would like to repeat again. that agreeing some kind of fragmented rule for governing space activity, not taking into account the approaches of all member states of the United Nations organization, and trying to ensure the domination of space by a small group of countries, as well as not achieving our basic goals on Paris is something that will not. promote and support international peace and security. On the contrary, it could lead to an escalation of tension in space, further divisions and splits among the international community, and failing to guarantee equal access to space for research and for its use for peaceful purposes. The adoption of such measures in the absence of a universal legal regime and an international treaty on Paris is fraught with the most dangerous negative possible consequences for keeping space free of weapons, of arms, for all aspects of arms control, for disarmament and non-proliferation and for international security as a whole. Despite this, we look towards the future with optimism. We trust that this negative outcome, which unfortunately is all we've managed to achieve in this session of the Working Group, will not have an effect on the group of government experts on Paris. We hope that the authors of the Initiative on Responsible Behaviors in Space will have the courage to recognise the objective reality, show professionalism. and participate in the activity of the Group of Governmental Experts in a constructive spirit in order to help it achieve its mandate, which is aimed at achieving a legally binding instrument and achieving our goals on par. We hope that this group to come differently, as distinct from this group, will be able to achieve substantive results. In conclusion, Chairman, we should like to express the hope that what we have said will be fully taken into account when you prepare your Chairman's summary on the outcome of the discussions in this open-ended working group. We also trust that our approach, our approach of principle, which we have expressed in the course of this session of the OEWG, will be fully included in working documents and draft reports which they were submitted to you by us. Turning to the issue of the Chair's summary, we should also like to state something clearly and openly to it that we consider this document as being a non-paper prepared by you in your personal capacity. That would mean it has no status for the activity of this group or for any further activity in the United Nations organization dealing with the issue of preventing annulms raised in outer space. And furthermore, we believe that the Chair's summary will not have annexed any documents. and I have in mind the draft report which was discussed here in this working group. and which was not approved by consensus by the Member States. We would like to underscore that in considering the, we consider the draft report strictly and solely as a document which was discussed by delegations in the course of informal consultations, but which does not have any status in the context of the activity of this group and was not approved by the Member States. Therefore, Chairman, once again, let me repeat, we trust that the Chair's summary will not include any document that was not agreed by consensus. Thank you for your attention.",4
S4M155,4,10,United States,"Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the United States, I would like to thank you for your exceptional leadership throughout this process. You have been an inspiration to us all. You have demonstrated incredible skill and especially patience with all of us as we have met over these last two years in the Open-Ended Working Group to discuss norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior. The work that you and your team did over the course of our four meetings guided our efforts throughout this process, creating a strong foundation for the discussions we had in all of our OEWG meetings. The draft report you and your team prepared was a balanced effort to summarize all of the discussions and proposals for norms of behavior that we have discussed in our previous meetings, and it was essential to the robust discussions we have had over the past five days. It is a credit to you and your team. I also want to thank all of the delegations that have participated in the Open Ended Working Group, whether you supported Resolution 76-231 or not. There has been robust, constructive, and substantive conversations here at the OEWG on these important space security matters and on the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects. This is an important issue that affects all of our states. and it has been an absolute pleasure to work with you all on this issue. And it is clear that there is interest in our work here. The debates, the working papers, and the participation in all of the meetings has clearly demonstrated that. I am especially grateful for the work that went into the joint statement and the statement just read by our distinguished colleague from the Philippines on behalf of a cross-regional group of states. Mr. Chair, as you know, the Conference on Disarmament has only 65 member states. But by our count, there have been more than 70 states that have participated in each of the OEWG meetings, showing that states have made an effort to show up and engage. The United States came into this process open to discussions on any issue any country wished to discuss. It is well known that we vote no on the annual UN resolution on no first placement. We have repeatedly made our case about the questions that we have about definitions, about whether it would be possible to confirm when a country had placed a weapon in orbit, and whether certain countries have already placed weapons in orbit. Despite that, the United States was open to having a conversation in this forum on any issue that any country was willing to discuss. We were willing to include language in the final report that discussed the no first placement resolution if that was what was needed to reach consensus. We strongly believe that if there was a political will on the part of states and a willingness to try to work on these issues, then we could make significant progress on this important issue. So it is regretful that we were unable to reach consensus on a set of recommendations. That calls for compromise and cooperation were met with red lines that would not allow for any issues to be discussed but a narrow set. Not the broad set of threats and risks contained in our mandate that are real, not theoretical, and that impact all of our countries. Nonetheless, important first steps have been taken. We have started down this path, one which was started at the United Nations during its 75th session and which has started a process focused on creating an international agreement on voluntary norms, rules, and principles that can reduce risks to international peace, security, and stability, and play an important role in increasing predictability and reducing risks of misperceptions and thus contributing to the pernmd. to the prevention of a conflict and an arms race in outer space. Moreover, we took an interim step at the United Nations to address the urgent threat of destructive direct-descent anti-satellite missile tests. And we thank states for their support in this effort. The United States believes that this is an important path to take. and that the international community can achieve tangible results in this effort to enhance the security and sustainability of the outer space environment. We must continue to work on developing and understanding around the expectations and standards the international community has in the use of space systems. And it is important that this process move forward in an inclusive manner in parallel with others to start creating this important foundation. As such, the United States looks forward to continuing that process with all states, and we welcome the calls by states to continue this process. So once again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your leadership, thank you to the Secretariat, and thank you to all the delegates here. We all come away from this process with new knowledge to help advance our collective efforts in this area. Thank you.",1
S4M157,4,10,Singapore,"Thank you, Chair, and thankfully I do speak in English. Singapore aligns itself with the joint statement delivered by the Philippines, and we now make this statement in our national capacity. Singapore would like to commend the Chair and your excellent team for steering us through Okay, I'm back. Singapore would like to commend the Chair and your excellent team for steering us through the past two years of discussions in this open-ended working group. Your hard work and dedication has been most appreciated. As evidenced by our discussions in this working group, space threats are of concern to all UN member states and other stakeholders. While the working group was unable to agree on a consensus report due to the various views, Singapore reiterates its support for an open, inclusive, rules-based multilateral system governing outer space activities. Against the backdrop of a deteriorating international security environment, a multilateral approach and commitment to inclusive dialogue is essential. The discussions on norms, rules and principles have been valuable in moving us toward the crucial goal of preventing an arms race in outer space. We regard these discussions as part of a journey that may result in a future legally binding instrument. And Singapore will continue to contribute actively to these efforts. We are assured that the Chair's summary will capture the Working Group's discussions and can form a basis for future discussions. Thank you.",1
S3M52,3,5,Russia,"Mr. Chairman. We would like to take the floor on both sub items on the topic. Two subtopic A&B, In conjunction in this connection. We would like to underscore.  That outer space capabilities, also called anti space capabilities are one of the key categories of systems. Which require very serious consideration and regulation as part of the work to prevent an arms race in outer space. It is our view that discussion of norms, rules, and principles, Concerning such systems. Require consideration of the aspects of the functioning of those systems that are both Earth and space based. As we have already noted in light of the growing threat of weaponization of space in connection with the policy of a series of UN member states To place weapons in space And use outer space for undertaking military activity With a view to ensuring their dominance And prevalence superiority. There is a need as an intermediary measure to affirm the predominance Of the existing and enforce international legal norms and principles Regulating activities in space. First and foremost, the 1967 Space Treaty And the resolution of the first UN General Assembly Special Session on Disarmament of 1978 Ssot 1As well as a series of other documents which we have made reference to yesterday morning. At the same time of permanent importance Against the backdrop of addressing concern, removing concern with regard to the potential of such systems Capabilities Would be a prohibition on the placement of weapons in space As well as a prohibition on the use of force or the threat of force. In connection with space objects or with their help Bearing in mind the existing lacunae in the International Space law Which were discussed by us in detail in the course of previous sessions of the open-ended working group. Member States should also. Take on the following obligations. Which The Russian Federation Has consistently called To be taken on not only within the framework of the working group, but also At all other international multilateral forum dedicated to discussion and review of issues pertaining to space security. We call upon states that take on the following responsibilities Not to use space objects as weapons with any target on Earth In the atmosphere or in space, Not to manufacture, test, Deploy Weapons in space. For undertaking any task or and including for anti-missile defence as an anti-satellite system. For use against targets on Earth or in the atmosphere in the air and also eliminate any systems already possessed by states. We also call upon states to take on the responsibility not to manufacture Not to test, not to deploy and not to use Space weapons. For anti-missile defence, As anti-satellite systems For use against targets on Earth or in the air Not to destroy Not to threaten not to encroach upon the normal functioning nor alter the flight trajectory of space objects of other states not to provide assistance, not incite other states groups of states, international intergovernmental or any other non-governmental organization including non-governmental legal persons, established, registered or located on the territory under their jurisdictions and or control to participation in the aforementioned activities. Dear participants and Mr. Chairman you can consider these proposals that we have just made as our concrete proposals. In connection with norms connected to the question of space security. Those standards that in our view could become recommendations of this group. In connection with the adoption of their obligations taken on by states. Of course, for us, it would be a matter, a priority for us, for these to take the form of a legally binding instrument. And since we considered that that is the logic underpinning resolution 76231 and that is why this group was established. In order to put in place, through recommendations, the basis for the preparation of the relevant legally binding instruments. With the further detailed obligations to be established therein, the adoption of the aforementioned norms would provide for a guarantee of predictability and enable the prevention of an arms race in outer space. So in order to fulfilling those tasks Which we are now faced with and which we are tasked with implementing as a matter of priority would serve as affirmation of the UN member states.",4
S3M54,3,5,New Zealand,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, when New Zealand considers responsible behaviours in the context of counter space capabilities whether Earth based or space based, we start from the principle that to be responsible must behaviour must avoid the creation of orbital debris. We have been pleased to see very many states that this OEWG support this principle. Avoiding the creation of debris includes avoiding the testing of counter space capabilities that could create debris such as Direct descent and Co orbital anti-satellite projectiles, directed energy attacks and any other non-kinetic means with the potential to damage or to destroy objects in orbit. In that context, the commitment of very many states not to test direct descent anti-satellite missiles is deeply encouraging. We would also lend our voice to the calls from several delegations yesterday that states should go further and commit to refrain from testing of any destructive anti-satellite capabilities. States should also recognize the extreme risk of the use or threatened use of any counter space system to create instability and a cycle of escalation. In particular, states should not conduct or support space activity that would intentionally damage critical infrastructure. Such activity could threaten wide access to vital services and is destabilising and irresponsible. More fundamentally, New Zealand continues to advocate for our principles, norms and rules. Which focus on promoting responsible behaviors rather than an approach that focuses on prohibiting particular capabilities. Such a prohibition risks limiting many productive capabilities such as lasers, active debris removal or on orbit servicing which have legitimate and beneficial uses in space. I would also like to address the position advanced by the delegation from the Russian Federation. While we do not rule out new legally binding mechanisms relating to security of space activities in the future, the proposed approach does little to address the current space security context. Many delegations have spoken this week to the importance of reducing risk of misperception, misunderstanding, and escalation. A legally binding instrument focused on the placement of weapons in outer space does not address these critical concerns. Additionally, such an approach faces challenges in identifying or defining weaponry in the space context and providing for verification of adherence to any instrument. Finally, a prohibition against placement of weapons in space. Does not address the threat of Earth to space weapons, which arguably represents the most pressing threat to space systems today. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M56,3,5,Italy,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. As we said many times before, the current strategic space environment appears increasingly congested, competitive and contested. We are aware of the increasing dependence of our societies on the use of outer space. Space based and space related products and services are now an integral part of modern life and are expected to become an indispensable component for every person on Earth. Potentially hostile activities are on the rise and increasingly affect the stability and security of outer space. There is indeed a growing risk that irresponsible behaviors in outer space may threaten human health, as well as socioeconomic stability and security. We believe that some kinetic and non-kinetic threats are particularly urgent and are of great concern in relation to kinetic threats. The persistent development or testing of direct ascent anti-satellite missiles compromised the security of outer space activities as they create long lasting debris. We welcome in this regard the adoption of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77 slash 41 as an important first step in building multilateral support for the commitment not to conduct destructive directors and anti-satellite missile testing. In addition, specific norms, rules and principle of responsible behaviours should encourage states to adopt open and transparent conduct, sharing information and notifying other states as appropriate of potentially dangerous operations. Early and routine consultations can also help prevent accidents, misperceptions and mistrust in relation to non-kinetic threats. We extensively discussed cyber-attacks to space objects during the second session of this OEWG, which could include sending malicious commands to a space object leading to a loss of data of control, render a satellite and maneuverability and result in the creation of space debris. Norms, rules and principle of responsible behaviors should recognize the harmful and destabilizing consequences of malicious cyber activities. Targeting space objects and especially the ground networks, building also core principles derived from existing normative framework and in order to limit the potential for cyber activities to contribute to an arms race in outer space. Norms of responsible behaviors could encourage the responsible reporting of vulnerabilities and the sharing and public and publication of information where possible on cyber related threats to space objects and they related infrastructures Including evidence of malicious activity. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M58,3,5,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. China believes that discussing the capabilities of anti-space capabilities, it must be based on the threats on Earth's space and outer space and It can. It should not only serve the interests of a handful of countries Or being selective by paying attention to only one capability. Judging from the previous discussions at this OEWG Certain countries pays high attention to the issue of earth based anti-satellite weapons On Co orbital, a site capability, non-kinetic a site capability and other country space capabilities they avoid talking about these issues. In fact, compared with Earth to space threats, Space to space threats are more stealth and more diversified, and may pose greater risks of causing conflicts. At the previous session, China mentioned that one certain superpower vigorously develops orbital warfare capabilities. For example, Establish D9, whose full-time mission is to conduct orbital warfare in 2020 and conducted many times space military exercises. According to the report released in April last year by Safer World Foundation. The US has conducted multiple tests of close approach and rendezvous in both LEO and GEO along with tracking targeting and hit to kill intercept technologies that could lead to a coorbital asset capabilities. According to this report, several of the technologies for space based mid-course ballistic missile intercept developed as part of the SDI during the 1980s could have been used to intercept satellites as well. According to the same report. The USG sub satellites are very active in the Geo region and since 2016. The GSAT satellites conducted dangerous rendezvous and proximity operations RPO to Chinese, Russian, Pakistani and Nigerian satellites for 10 times and the closest distance was only 10 kilometers That could have easily caused in orbital collisions. We hope to seek clarification from the US delegation are the behaviors of GSAT satellites something that is safe and professional. In our view, the fundamental way to resolve a space-to-space threat Is to through a legally binding way, prohibit the placement of weapons in outer space. The superpower should abandon the Cold War mentality. With a responsible attitude, actively promote the negotiation process for an outer space arm control legal instrument. Only then can we fundamentally preserve the lasting Stability and peace in outer space In view of the above position, China recommends the working group to appeal to all countries to abide by the following guideline. Stop developing orbital warfare capability and not to conduct malicious RPO operations to foreign satellites. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M510,3,5,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Hopefully we can get a little bit of an interactive dialogue going here. And I thought that the delegation of China made an excellent, excellent case for norms of responsible behavior regarding proximity operations and perhaps illustrated how we need to discuss what is a safe operation and develop norms around those safe operations to reduce misunderstandings. So I think we can certainly consider in this working group that that's one norm of responsible behaviour that Could be clarified, maybe expanded upon In our report and would make a meaningful contribution to reducing threats in outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S3M512,3,5,Austria,"Sorry, there was a slight misunderstanding from our side. We thought we are still under topic 2A, so this is now a topic under 2B. If you're if it's OK for you, no problem. This is this is not official agenda or program.",2
S3M514,3,5,Austria,"Mr. Chair, several of the working papers submitted proposed to establish norms against any intentional behavior which endangers the space environment and its peaceful use. These concerns in particular the creation of space debris, but also other malign or irresponsible behaviour. In relation to our previous discussion under 2A, we have to stress once again the high risk that arises from the creation of space debris for the sustainable use in outer space, which is equally problematic with regard to space-to-space threats.  An additional problem, however, lies in the direct threat of a weaponization as well as a possible arms race in outer space. Cooperative threats against space systems can take different forms, forms, and do not necessarily require specific capabilities. And several delegations have indicated in the past two days the mere possibility of coorbital attacks, be it through space objects equipped with specific anti-satellite or dual-purpose capabilities, can contribute to mistrust and misperceptions. Furthermore, it is very likely the methods applied in outer space would fall under the threshold of use of force and as a result, further increase uncertainty and very necessary among space actors. Together with an increasingly congested environment, this creates a high risk of possible escalation and occurrence of grave incidents. More specifically, we are concerned about possible kinetic orbital attacks that include a wide range of possibilities such as the launch of projectiles, deliberate collisions, proximity operations, or the use of mechanical extensions or chemical sprayers on space objects, Other threats include non-kinetic capabilities such as electromagnetic waves, lasers, jamming or spoofing. We are still in a position where we can avoid the situation in which space objects need protection against these capabilities, which would increase the threshold for emerging spacefaring nations As well as the commercial cost of outer space activities as well as space-based services. States have proposed a number of possible norms and guidelines on behavior in outer space in their working papers. Among those we particularly support strong norms against the testing and using of corporate counter space capabilities, kinetic or non-kinetic, as well as guidelines for the safe and consensual conduct of rendezvous and proximity operations. At the same time, we consider it necessary to address mistrust related to corporate operations and capabilities through the sharing of information, the establishment of communication channels to full use of existing instruments, and if necessary, the establishment of new ones. Only address the problems of mistrust and possible miscalculations, but also allow for a more orderly use of space, which is increasingly contested, contested and competitive. I thank you.",0
S3M516,3,5,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Like my distinguished colleague from Austria, I also was under the impression that we are still under 2B, and I would like to deliver an intervention under this topic. Thank you, Mr. Chair. My delegation takes the floor to refer to possible recommendations to alleviate space to space and space to Earth threats. In the first working paper that we submitted with Germany during the previous session, we identified insufficient understandings of mutual threat perceptions, lack of channels of communications and lack of transparency. Sources of current space related security risk at the 2nd OEWG session, my delegation stressed that for the Philippines, uncoordinated launches of space launch vehicles or rockets into space and insufficient transparency and coordination with regard to uncontrolled re-entry are crucial threats. Launches and uncontrolled re-entry of parts of launch vehicles may create debris that fall on land or sea, features that could pose A considerable threat to instruct to land structures, ship aircraft, fishing boats and other vessels that will pass through the drop zones. For the Philippines, this is not merely a safety issue, but an issue of national security as well. In the context of space launches and uncontrolled re-entry, communication coordination and transparency are all crucial to ensuring the threat perceptions are reduced. With regard to space-to-space threats, the vulnerability of developing countries like the Philippines are particularly acute. This is because our ability to monitor space-based assets and the immediate environment around them is limited and our current space-based assets have no propulsion systems and therefore lack the manure ability to evade physical threats. Most notably space debris. We therefore support the recommendation from Japan and others for the OBWG to recommend that states limit the destructive actions that may cause massive or substantive amount of debris in outer space. We also note that Egypt in its working paper also provided some insights of what kind of such activities may be, and this includes this include acts of complete destruction of space objects. Deliberate fragmentation of space objects and the use of directed energy weapons to destroy the electronic devices of space objects, which of course would also create debris. Against this backdrop, we also have worked with Germany in putting together recommendations in our second working paper. Some of those recommendations address space to space and space to Earth threats such as the following First states should not conduct or knowingly support rendezvous operations with space systems of another state unless that state has given prior Permission to the said operations. States should conduct launches of missiles and space launch vehicles in a way that ensures the greatest extent possible and feasible maximum the safe and secure operation of space objects and space systems. When launching, the launching state should issue pre-launch notifications and conduct prior coordination with potentially affected countries, including those identified as potential drop zones of re-entering debris from the launch that pose a potential risk of injury to people or damage or destruction to property. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M518,3,5,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate you indulging me and giving me the floor again. I just noted that the delegations of Phillip Delegation of Philippines raised another excellent point and one which we could consider in the context of our work being about re-entries. Now as you know, I think I may have explained in a previous session before Canada experienced an uncontrolled re-entry from a nuclear power sourced object in 1978. There was no notification that the object was re-entering prior to its re-entry, obviously causing a lot of concern, and resulting in a lot of clean up. After that there was an initiative. By Canada, many other states to put together some principles related to nuclear power source spacecraft. One of those principles, Principle 5, which found its way into the resolution on nuclear power source spacecraft was about notification of re-entry. And it provides a number of things that states should do. Essentially sort of a guide on responsible behaviors for how you use nuclear power source spacecraft. And that's perhaps another thing for this group to look into in order to reduce. Misperceptions when there are controlled or uncontrolled re-entries that may affect the territory of other states is to provide notifications of re-entry, including information on the system, the type of fuel it has, or any other special characteristics that a state might need in order to remedy or mitigate the damage from an uncontrolled re-entry that reaches the surface of the Earth. This would just be another one of those sort of communication principles that can help reduce mistrust and reduce Perception of threats And I welcome any other thoughts on this particular item from other delegations. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S3M520,3,5,Brazil,"Interest of presenting our views on the issue of counter space capabilities in a coherent and comprehensive manner. My delegation will address topics 2A and 2B together in the following statements. Mr. Chair, Brazil's long-standing commitment to the objective of the prevention of an arms race in outer space translates into our steadfast support for the negotiations on a legally binding instrument on Paris in the CD, our advocacy against the use or threat of use of force through space capabilities or against them. As well as the placement of weapons in outer space. It is with utmost concern, therefore, that we have been witnessing recent trends of developing developments of offensive counter space capabilities in the context of increasing strategic competition and deepening tensions among spacefaring nations. In parallel, the emergence of dual use and dual-purpose space technologies greatly enhances the risks of misperception, misinterpretation and miscalculation. Mr. Chair, destructive anti-satellite weapons, both ground based and Co orbital, are A cause of particular concern since the intentional destruction of satellites through the testing or use of such weapons generates uncontrolled proliferation of debris at a massive scale. My delegation is stabling this week a working paper that aspires to contribute to the date to the debate of this OEWG on the issue of destructive ASAP weapons, whose main points will be summarised as follows. The increase in space debris generated by destructive ASA tests not only leads to an increase in risks for the safety of space navigation, but also has the direct impact on the costs of launching and operating space assets. Such effects are particularly acute for developing States and states with fewer space objects in orbit, for which the loss of even one satellite due to a collision with debris would have potentially catastrophic consequences. Such states are also more vulnerable to such threats, as they have limited capacities in space situational awareness, modest capabilities for monitoring assets in orbit, and more often operate space-based assets without propulsion systems And therefore, unable to carry out collision avoidance maneuvers. If the issue of space debris worsens to the point in which collision avoidance becomes a necessary feature in space assets, the cost of building satellites and placing them and maintaining them in orbit may rise to the point of pricing out many developing countries from space altogether. In addition, the testing of destructive ASAP weapons also creates distrust and enhances the risk of weaponization of outer space, thus posing a significant threat to international peace and security. Brazil therefore believes that the OEWG should build on two existing proposals for international moratoria and combine them in order to make a comprehensive recommendation on destructive A sets. The first moratorium is contained in the 2014 UN General Assembly resolution A slash res slash 69 slash 41 tabled by Russia titled Quote no first placement of weapons in Outer Space. This resolution encouraged states open quote, to consider the possibility of upholding, as appropriate, a political commitment not to be the first to place weapons in outer space. End of quote, which can be understood to include the placement of Co orbital AESAT systems in outer space. The second moratorium was proposed more recently in 2022 with the adoption of UN General Assembly resolution A slash res slash 77 slash 41 tabled by the United States titled Open quote Destructive direct Ascent Anti Satellite Missile Testing. And of course, this resolution calls upon states all states to commit not to conduct destructive direct descent anti missile tests, even though this moratorium called for by the resolution is limited to direct descent for Land based ASAP tests. The resolution recognizes in its preamble that, and I open quote the use of other types of anti-satellite systems might have a similar negative impact on the long-term sustainability of the outer space environment. End of quote. It also includes a reference to the negative impacts of the use of destructive ASAP in conflict. Open quote concerned that the use of destructive anti-satellite systems might have widespread and irreversible impacts on the outer space environment End of quote. As stated by my delegation in the first session of the OEWG, Brazil believes that the time has come for a ban on all destructive anti-satellite tests. The first step towards that goal can be taken through the adoption by the OEWG of a recommendation for a comprehensive multilateral moratorium on such tests, which should open the way for a more formal prohibition to be enshrined, enshrined in a future legally binding framework. The OEWG report should also include a recommendation on a clear norm against the testing and or use of any type of destructive anti-satellite weapons, either specifically or as a part of a general norm against the use of force against space objects. Mr. Chair, the issue of space debris is one that has a direct impact on the prospects for sustainable development and on the full enjoyment of the rights of states, particularly developing countries, to the peaceful uses of outer space. We cannot allow it to be held hostage to the dynamics and vagaries of strategic instability and competition. Is the chair. This OEWG should also devote particular attention to the threat represented by non-kinetic anti-satellite systems despite their less tangible impact, vis-a-vis destructive means, non-connective means are already being employed offensively and offer a clear and present risk of further intentions in outer space. The OEWG should therefore include in its recommendations norms against harmful interference with space systems of other states. Especially where there's a risk of leading to permanent loss of functionality or control of space assets, including through the following means. One directed energy such as laser or electromagnetic beams Interference with satellite systems through radio frequency jamming or spoofing, cyber-attacks against space objects or their ground control stations, and physical attacks against ground control stations. Unless point is the rendezvous and proximity operations RPos between satellites without prior communication or understanding with the state concerned. Thank you, Chair.",0
S3M522,3,5,Japan,"Mr. Chair, may I May I talk to May I talk about topic 3?",2
S3M524,3,5,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our Japanese colleagues for their indulgence. I just wanted to make a point regarding the discussion we've had between our Philippines and Canadian colleagues this morning about the importance of space launch notifications. While it was not in the US working paper, it is something we do as a routine practice. We exchange missile launch notifications and space launch vehicle notifications with many countries. Because space launch vehicles could look and use many of the similar technologies to missiles, having those launch notifications can reduce tensions, can help ensure countries about the intentions of a launch. Additionally, as discussed, having the notices that warn of where objects from that space launch land is also a very important activity and then finally advance notification. Also aids countries in conducting space traffic management Because we don't know where the satellite is going to be. Having that notification that a satellite is going to be launched will help governments and commercial entities track these satellites and ensure that space remains a safe environment. Thank you.",0
S3M526,3,5,Nigeria,"Oh yeah, Three. Sorry.",2
S3M528,3,5,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor. We would like to make comments now on the topic to be Mr. Chair. There is significant scope for misunderstanding or miscalculation in the testing, deployment or use of counter space capabilities which could in turn lead to increased tensions between states, potentially to conflict and put regional or strategic stability at risk. The dual use nature of many capabilities and the absence of transparency and trust makes it difficult to determine intent on the part of the state's operators. Moreover, the fact that the internal components of a satellite cannot be checked once in orbit and this inability to determine capability once placed in space poses unique and difficult issues for verification. This place is a practical difficulty on capability limiting norms. However, we can reduce the risks of misunderstandings and inadvertent escalation by establishing new norms, rules and principles related to the use of such capabilities. And we believe norms, rules and principles can help by encouraging more transparency and communication around certain space activities that might be misinterpreted. Encouraging safe practices when conducting defence and security related space activities so as to avoid accidents or incidents that could cause escalation and thirdly, avoiding or minimizing collateral effects such as space debris or forms of interference that significantly impact civilian activity. Mr. Chair, with those 3 criteria in mind, the UK proposes, for further discussion and consideration by UN Members, the following ideas for new norms, rules and principles which would apply outside of armed conflict. Number one states should provide advanced notification of defence and security exercises that could have an impact on space systems and services in order to reduce the risk of misunderstanding or misperception of their intentions. Two, states should not destructively test the counter space capabilities in space. C States should ensure satellites under their jurisdiction and control or operating on their behalf, do not conduct counter space testing activities that impair the safe operation of satellites under the jurisdiction and control of another state. The States should ensure satellites under the jurisdiction and control, or operating on their behalf, do not physically connect with satellites under the jurisdiction and control of another state without prior consultation and consent. Five states should avoid jamming or spoofing activities against space systems that generate collateral impacts on civilian activity over large areas, such as disruption of air traffic or emergency services. Six states should not cause the permanent loss of command and control of satellites of other states. Seven states should not cause the permanent damage to the imaging sensors of satellites of other states. Thank you very much, Chair. That ends our remarks on this topic.",0
S3M530,3,5,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Regarding, the statements made by Canada and the USA would like to make a reply. I believe that these interactive dialogue is very necessary. First of all, regarding Canada's mention, which is about the re-entry. In the 1970s. and especially the re-entry issues they mentioned in the 17th The Canadian colleagues believe that the non-controlled re-entry should be a priority in the discussion of this working group. In this regard, China holds a different view, Regarding the non-controlled re-entry As well as nuclear power supplied And especially the usage. These issues have already been discussed at CORPUS And has also reflected in related resolutions of the UNG and the documents of Copious. For example, in 1992 regarding the nuclear source powered principle. As well as 2019 guidelines, LGS guidelines, before this meeting, many colleagues also mentioned that. The OEWG s work should not interfere with the works at the other fora. Therefore, to avoid overlapping in discussion on in discussing the issues dealt with at Scorpios. China would like to suggest that issues on re-entry and others should be addressed with caution. Furthermore, the Canadian delegate has also made reference to. The event of G sets a satellite which can be a reference Or guidance for us. The interpreters apologize to set up your operations Could serve as a guidance China would like to thank the Canadian delegates for his comment. However, for China, Discussing this Malignant, Malicious RPO issues is not so much about responsible or not being responsible or not being responsible Or we should first of all discuss its lawful nature, whether it is lawful or not. In other words, even if people believe that The behaviour of satellite is responsible It does not mean it is lawful Only when we can judge on the legality of behavior of a country. Can we determine its legal responsibility. This is not a dichotomy such as responsible irresponsible can achieve. Therefore, in short, We should first of all determine whether an event is illegal or illegal Before considering whether it is responsible or irresponsible Because it is very subjective to determine whether it's responsible or not. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",2
S3M532,3,5,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I apologize for again taking the floor on this topic, but in the spirit of interactive dialogue, I just wish to acknowledge and thank our distinguished colleagues from Canada, China and the United States for their inputs with regard to the issue of re-entry. We fully align with some of the statements that was delivered by our distinguished colleague from China with regard to the caution that we need to undertake when discussing the issue of re-entry, given that it might interfere with the work of CORPUS.  However, we think that this issue cannot be outside the scope of this OEWG, especially since some countries including the Philippines see this not only as a safety issue but also as a security issue. Now we have said in the past that we see this OEWG already as a TCBM where we can frankly discuss security threats and it is in the spirit that we are raising it here as a matter of security concern for our country and we think that there is an opportunity for us to make recommendations. To alleviate that security concern and if that recommendation is to look at the work of couples and other related bodies in Vienna, we would also be happy to make that recommendation as well in in our in our final report. We also wish to thank Canada for, for their very constructive inputs with regard to the notifications that are that that that that could constitute. Measures that would that that would assure countries of with regard to Rocket launches and re-entering debris from our perspective we would like to say that we. We would like to we would appreciate it if launching countries would provide pre-launch notifications at least 90 days before the target launch date to include planned launch notification, possible drop zones in the territory of either state and other associated risk. We also would appreciate updated notifications regarding changes in the schedule and other details of the planned launch post launch notifications including estimated date, time, location of re-entry and surface impact. Notification regarding recovered debris from the rocket launch that has fallen. On the other participants territory, so with this objective we think that it's really crucial for us to consider very carefully the suggestions from Japan to have a national points of contact which we believe would facilitate ease of communication and coordination. And again, on this point of coordination and communication, we wish to refer to our working paper on the duty of due regard where we refer to the rich resource from international Lodgers prudence that states that. You know, the duty of due regard necessarily involve consultations on the basis of good faith, and that requires that avenues for such consultations are exhausted, and it also provides standards for which to undertake such consultations. It should encompass A conscious balancing of rights and interest. Including extensive concern regarding the other party's reaction, suggestions of compromise and willingness to offer assurances, and an understanding of other parties concerned in connection with any proposed activities. We believe that this jurisprudential standards on the duty of jury guard arising from other relevant bodies of international law is relevant because we want to avoid cases where consultations are done pro forma and not necessarily in good faith and some tendencies for states to not undertake the necessary diligence in considering the legitimate concerns of other States and just conduct consultations for the sake of conducting consultations. So we believe that these are very relevant standards for responsible behaviour that would enrich our understanding of the international legal and normative frameworks as they relate to outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S3M534,3,5,Canada,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I was attempting to follow closely what the delegation of China was saying, and I think perhaps there's a small clarification that's necessary to my earlier statements. If it wasn't clear in any way, I was in no way suggesting that any of the proximity operations that had been conducted by the satellites listed in the statement of the delegation of China were in any way unlawful. I was only pointing out that the perception Of one country about lawful activities Can be perhaps incorrect in the lack where we have a lack of communication or notices. The same goes for launches. As our distinguished colleague from the United States mentioned, launches can be misperceived as something other than peaceful and thus pre-launch notifications can be very useful. And again I would like to stress the point that we're not talking here about lawful versus unlawful. We're talking about responsible and irresponsible, and in that context, actions that may not be unlawful can still be irresponsible under certain circumstances, particularly when there's a possibility of misperception of intention. And with respect to the work of Copious, I'm very well aware that Copious has worked on nuclear power source principles. In fact, I was citing from it when I talked about the example in 1978 of Cosmos 954. The reference, the reference. In this context is not so much about notices that copious has talked about, but notices for the purpose of explaining intention and providing confidence to other states about the nature of the activity so that they do not perceive it to be a threat where it is clearly a peaceful use of outer space. So that's what we're doing in this context. With respect to notifications of launches and re-entries. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S3M536,3,5,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we're getting to a really very interesting discussion Festival. It is Gradually going towards the discussion of the basic principles and understandings on which this group is based, that's very important As we move towards preparing the outcome document I would like to react to what was said by the distinguished delegate of Canada, as well as the colleagues from China and the Philippines. First and foremost, with regard to the issue once again Of the Forces in operation within the working group, And the efforts being undertaken also in other international for a Including in the key Basic form of the United Nations. Concerned with space activities That being CORPUS, Here we would like To support the delegation of China With regard To the fact that the activities of that working group of the working group Should not Duplicate Or a prejudge in any way the outcome of work Of other international forum and that includes the UN Outer Space Committee. Here there should be a single vector for cooperation interaction And that is the fact that the UN Space Committee Has already undertaken the work and outcomes have been achieved there With documents that have been agreed upon by that committee. Which could assist the work of the working group But not vice versa. This group cannot seek to influence the work of CORPUS In view of the mandate and status of this group. So let us allow the copper's experts to continue the work, on those issues That it is occupied with, many of which fall beyond the remit of this working group. Let us not Prevent the copper from doing its work on certain issues Since that work is underway in that forum already But has yet to be completed. Therefore, The notion of this working group, Cooperating and influencing the agenda of other groups seems, in our view, to be entirely counterproductive and could impinge on the mandates of other working groups. This goes not only for CORPUS but also for the UN Commission on Disarmament. Well, one of the Questions under review, relate to transparency and competence building measures in space 6. Where the three-year discussion cycle within the Commission has yet to be completed. Therefore, once again. Let us not pre-empt the work of that Commission Which should be Allowed to provide its recommendations to the UNGA. Moreover, within that Commission Next year, for example, there is a plan for the review of the UN Secretary General's report. Which is in the near future to be prepared, pursuant to resolution the Union can resolution On transparency and confidence building measures with regard to space activities. It seems to us that This group and its work should not interfere with or undermine the work of other for a Moreover, I would like to offer some clarification with regard to legal and non-legal activities And the connection with so-called responsible, irresponsible behaviour. It seems to us Extremely risky by way of a way forward. And Jesus, the suggestion that we had from the Canadian delegation Supported by a series of other Western delegations to the effect that Certain Lawful acts May be deemed to be irresponsible In our view. Such a framing of the question could lead to a seriously risky Division of the field of law and the legal framework that currently exists And in a broader way, international law standards Relating to matters of space security and security of space activities. In essence, this would suggest some form of an attempt to revise the existing international law framework Through, The assumption or adoption of certain non-binding understandings That are not legally binding in character And which, In their nature could be interpreted In many very different ways, by different states. We have seen what that sort of interpretation can lead to already within the framework of this working group's work on various different issues. It never brings anything positive, it simply leads to possible discrimination by certain Member States Against other Member States. We consider this Unnecessary We consider this to be counterproductive from the standpoint of international law and ultimately. The aim of ensuring space security and the security of space activities, therefore We call Upon colleagues to strictly base themselves on legally binding international norms and those norms and principles about which we are talking should become a part of the international legal system in connection with ensuring space security. No measure should undermine that existing system As we have already said, and at least as far as we understand it, the in terms of the goals of this group, we are seeking to fill legal gaps in existing international law And put in place the basis for the creation of legally binding standards to fill those gaps.",1
S3M538,3,5,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I sincerely thank the Canadian delegate for the response. I also wish to express my appreciation to the Canadian delegate. With regards the good example that he put forward for us to discuss rules. He mentioned the GSAP satellite. The RPO of GSAB satellite and believe that it is legal. Does it mean that it is irresponsible, If it is legal and responsible. Then does it mean that States should follow such behaviors 2nd. The Canadian delegate also mentioned that Here we are talking about responsible and irresponsible rather than legal and non-legal. As a space lawyer, I'm quite curious. Legal standards Should be the basis for us to develop for the OEWG to develop norms, principles and rules. If we disregard the issue of legal and non-legal. How can we talk about the observance of international laws? How can we talk about the respect of international laws? My last point Is that I'm very honored that I am very delighted to be able to participate in the LDS negotiation together with our Canadian colleague with regards the rendered discussion of copies, I also have some knowledge. The issue of safety.",2
S3M540,3,5,China,"With regard the issue of safety, we should leave it to copiers. Regards the issue of security, That is issues in relation to unfriendly Provocative And malicious And intentional behaviors. Should be discussed here at the OU WG, With regards staff, the safety of staff and assets, we believe that it should be left to the copies. So as to avoid us duplicating the work of copiers here. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S3M542,3,5,Japan,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Since some countries mentioned proximate operations in the topic 2A and 2B, we would like to share Japans idea regarding wonderful and proximity operations.  Various capabilities and types of operations have dual use nature in outer space, notably including rendezvous and proximal operation or RPO. Several countries mentioned with regards to our peer in their working paper, such as a paper submitted by German and Philippine, United Kingdom, Canada and Republic of Korea. There's no concrete provisions which stipulates dangerous or safe distance for our peers at this time And the action to avoid collision between space assets depends on the differences in technical and operational capabilities between states. In this regard, the risk of collision is judged by each country from a subjective view and so it is not appropriate to discuss the details related to our POS from our technical perspective in this OEWG. From this point of view, Japan tried to propose a draft recommendation focusing on the consequences and behaviors. States should not conduct rendezvous and proximity operation or RPO critical physical damage to space objects under the jurisdiction of another state unless prior consent is provided. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M544,3,5,Nigeria,"Thank you for giving Nigeria the floor, Mr. Chair. Apologies for the slight Error. The other time we had been benefiting immensely from the interactive dialogue on 2A and 2B. Hence the self-proclaimed 2C. Apologies once again. Nonetheless, we reiterate our support for the OG process, Mr. Chair. Cyberspace has become an indispensable tool. With enormous potential capable of shaping economic prosperity as well as developing credible defense mechanisms which are all characteristics of a strong modern industrial nation. On the contrary, the militias use of space systems including Artificial intelligence and ICT related mechanisms have continued to pose stress to the international peace and security landscape. Considering that the manner in which these systems are utilized have evidently become a key factor in determining the affairs of many nations. The potential use of space systems to conduct malicious attacks, as well as causation of space debris, including unexplainable rendezvous proximity operations, is of great concern to my country, and we call on states who have developed such capabilities to abstain from using them, particularly against states who use space systems for peaceful uses, Mr. Chair. The fight against cyber-crime is of utmost importance to my country. Hence our investment in capacity building to safeguard our cyberspace systems through strict adherence to cyber activity guidelines. This has continued to make giant strides with the aid of international cooperation. Nigeria through its National Cyber Security Strategy has established 7 key focuses to strengthen its approach to the issue of cybersecurity and the use of space systems. They include incident management in the area of detection and response, vulnerability handling, artifacts handling, collaboration sector-based computer emergency response team and training, research and development. The fundamental aim of the National Strategy Security Strategy as enshrined in the National Security Policy framework To achieve a harmonized security strategy that will respond to the dynamism of the national security threat landscape. Mr. Chair. Nigeria is of the opinion that the dual use nature of space systems should be integrated to promote peaceful uses void of malicious activities. Cyberspace should be a place of opportunities and not a place for harmful competition among superpowers, which could ultimately have adverse effects on states without similar capabilities. While critical infrastructure continues to be targeted in the context of space systems, it has become imperative that the adequate measures should be in place to regulate such activities included the possibility of a legally binding instrument, Mr. Chair. My delegation strongly upholds that the weaponization of space systems Should be outlawed at all levels in order to promote international peace and stability.  My delegation also believes that the threats posed by malicious use of space systems have made it necessary for adequate safeguards to be in place to ensure that the principle of peaceful uses is strongly upheld furthermore. Action oriented mechanisms to aid potential coordination and integration programs, including confidence building measures such as transparency and exchanging of best practices in the area of space systems is equally critical to my country. Finally, Mr. Chair, while my delegation strongly recommends that the final outcome document of this process should reflect the inalienable need For the consideration of a legally binding framework, when the delegation wishes to reiterate its support for the work of this OEWG and welcome constructive dialogue aimed at ensuring that cyberspace does not become another ground for harmful competition, but for cooperation aimed at progressiveness, I thank you.",0
S3M546,3,5,France,"Merci, Mr. President, thank you very much, Chairperson. Good morning to everyone. I have comments on topic 3, which are also pertinent for two and topic four also 1st in response to what was said by the Philippines delegation. On the discussions, notification of launches for us is a very important issue. This is a part also of our written contribution. We call on states to follow this model Of notifications. The concerns of the Philippines are legitimate, and this is not just an issue that should be handled at Coppolas, because today's debate shows that for the Philippines and for other states who share these same concerns. This is an issue which is not just one of security, but also safety So not just safety issue, but also a national security issue. So this group which we're in, was put together to discuss these concerns, but also to find solutions. Second, this morning we heard a lot of ideas for norms. But it is worth remaining mindful, and this is a major part of the French contribution. The norms that we develop here must also be robust enough to respond to a set of criteria. Some of these criteria Which are the same for transparency and confidence building measures. Those norms, above all, must be clear That is, there must be shared language which is unambiguous and specific And referring to the discussions this morning once again to talk about weapons in space Does not make this more ambiguous. We need to reduce or eliminate any possible 'cause for misunderstandings, for error, for misperception of the actions of states. Banning the placement of weapons and state does not Eradicate possible grounds for mistrust or miscommunication. Misunderstandings as can take place on Earth and such norms must be violated in the spirit. And we've heard some proposals for norms this morning that are not verifiable, and some of them which never could be And so we fear that such norms could not become operational. We would like to support norms that have that prospect and not those that Are already null and void. We should not lose sight in our discussions of destabilising factors which generate tension or misunderstandings And that's not directly related to the amount of debris, debris created in space when certain countries conduct anti-satellite tests. There are two aspects, one is the debris created in space and the other issue is the message which was sent in terms of undermining space security. The same concerns for certain activities in orbits and I referred also to the Canadian message Activities such as physical contact or so-called rendezvous operations Are illicit and they should be banned in all contexts. But they can generate all kinds of different reactions. They can engender tensions. This is not subjective. If we are concerned by situations of this kind, I think that no one in this room Would not be worried if someone was attempting to break into their home. It would be a concern for everyone The same Issue is valid here, but instead of house breaking we have other illicit acts and so there are norms and can be norms for responsible behaviours And certain actions that should not be conducted without the clear consent of the state concerned an invitation into the House, for example. Thank you.",0
S3M548,3,5,France,"Now see miss. Thank you, Mr. Chairperson. I wanted to make sure that my words came across clearly. I fear that was not the case. I wanted to be clearly interpreted and so I wanted to take the floor again and explain without any metaphors which would complicate our message. The meaning was as follows. First, I would like to reiterate that for France, the English term space safety translates as the French security Special in the sense of A seat belt And certain special is space security.  second, I wanted to indicate that in terms of international law applicable in space Rendezvous operations Or the contact physique between space objects are not illicit About this type of operation. Nevertheless, can generate tensions, Tensions which are not subjective, they can be shared by all states. Using satellites in space. Thus it is for this reason that we consider it necessary To provide a framework for such operations and to do this, we propose A norm which is clear. It is that such operations of rendezvous options should not be conducted without the advance consent from the state concerned. Thank you.",2
S3M550,3,5,Switzerland,"Thank you, Chairperson. As regards topic 3 on Julius capabilities, we would like to offer the following considerations. 1st we would like to reaffirm the principle of free and equitable access to space for all states without discrimination and in respect of other principles in international law In terms of this specific element, we are of the opinion that the following activities should be considered as not corresponding To responsible behaviour in space. 1st, Placing in danger, damaging or destroying the satellites of another country using Co orbital systems. 2nd,  affecting Proximity operations, Which interfere with the operations of a space system belonging to another state Or which threaten its integrity. 3rd , Violating the functioning Of space systems using lasers or electromagnetic capacities, or indeed other capabilities of the same nature. Next, Conducting rendezvous operations With the satellite of another stage, without consultations, without and without advance consent from that state and 5th , Approaching Or following an active satellite of another stage without consultations with it or without the advance consent of that state.  In general, the implementation of rendezvous and proximity operations Should be conducted in the greatest degree of transparency possible. In addition, such operations must be planned in such ways to avoid all possible ambiguity Could be perceived as a threat for a state approached by such a satellite in order to avoid rendezvous and proximity operations being perceived as such a threat. It is important notably to develop And Adopt the appropriate measures. In this context, we would like to refer to work document #1 submitted by Germany and the Philippines. This contains particularly pertinent proposals on this issue. We will go into greater detail in specific situations under discussion of topic 8. Thank you, Chairperson.",0
S3M552,3,5,Germany,"Thank you, Mr. Chairperson and thank you to all delegations which engage today in a very interesting and active discussion. I think that is exactly the spirit we need in this open-ended working group, which is a inclusive format for sharing views and building common understanding. I would like to briefly mention our consideration that we have put in the joint paper of the Philippines and Germany. With regard to Rendezvous and proximity operations, so we believe that Two recommendations could be made at this point. 1st It's a very clear one and we already talked about this States should not conduct or knowingly support rendezvous or docking operations with space systems of another space. The affected state have given prior consent. I think the beauty of this proposal is its clarity and. Easiness also to verify and. The second would rather refer to a proximity operations and Concludes  to the fact that states should Submit a request for consent. The affected state in advance of such an operation and that such notifications should include at least and there are some requirements the planning, the plan timing, the trajectory and the objective of the operations And our second general rule on proximity operations is that state should not conduct or knowingly support proximity operations which impair the safe operations of space system of another state. They should aim for the greatest possible transparency and then void ambiguity in their operations that could be misperceived or misinterpreted by another state as a threat, and we also fully understand that this is more difficult to implement and also to verify Returning to the interactive discussion of today's morning, I would like also to make Two clarifications, I think. Agenda item three shows perfectly the added value of a behavioural approach And not to limiting oneself to objects and capabilities Because in dual use operations we use objects but we don't know do not know for which purpose and with which intent So An object in space is an object. Is an object, but nothing much more And Exactly here we can see that we need to focus on activities and behaviours and secondly, I would come back to the statements made by some delegations this morning that we would exclusively or one sided address to On direct ascent Missile testing. So to Earth, to space threats. I think our recommendations we made together with the Philippines have shown that this is not the case. We are also Very much looking at Co orbital threats and we are also looking for a comprehensive. Result of our joint endeavour in this group. Thank you.",0
S3M554,3,5,New Zealand,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. New Zealand welcomes the depth of discussions on remote proximity operations and I'd like to add some short points. IPO's are a particular activity with a potential range of potentially significant peaceful uses, such as debris mitigation, but which can present as a threat within certain contexts. Legitimate use of RPO capabilities will be increasingly important as space activity and the number of objects in space continues to grow. IPO's involving other states assets must be conducted with the highest level of transparency in order to prevent the risk of misperception. New Zealand would like to lend its support to the position advocated by a number of countries that states should not conduct IPOs without prior consent from the operator of the satellite being approached. Similarly, states should not shadow other state satellites without prior consultation or consent. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M556,3,5,Australia,"Thank you, Chair. On this topic, Australia would like to make a few observations. We believe generally due to the dual use nature of most sorry many space systems, threatening and irresponsible behaviour using any capability is concerning, Non binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour should focus on clarifying expectations and modifying behaviour to address the effects of threatening and irresponsible behaviour. Given that the dual use nature of many space capabilities allows a potential for counter space activities, Australia supports developing non binding norms rules And principles of responsible behaviour which apply to all activities and behaviour in space, Rather than dual use or counter space capability, specific norms As such, we would like to reassert that in all situations, states should operate in from, through and to space safely. State should avoid endangering the lives of humans in space States should avoid creating harmful interference And space states should avoid creating long lived debris Behaviour utilising any space system can potentially create Misconceptions and misunderstandings These So in relation to this, we also support the following norms. State should communicate and make effective notifications to enhance the safety and stability of outer space activities.  States should establish, maintain and utilize communication channels to resolve concerns about international peace and security that arise from outer space activities And finally, states should, where possible, enable the provision of space situational awareness information to an organization or organisations to aggregate, verify and publish. Thank you, Chair.",0
S3M558,3,5,Philippines,"Mr. Chair, with reference to dual news capabilities, we wish to refer to the ASEAN working paper submitted during the first session of the OEWG, which states that any initiatives on outer space security should take into account the inherent right to peaceful uses of space technology, and they should therefore not hamper innovation. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that risk and threats do not necessarily arise from capabilities alone which are in themselves value neutral Indeed, some of these capabilities, including those that facilitate RPO's, could advance efforts to promote the long term sustainability of space. I believe this is a point that has also been made by the distinguished delegate from New Zealand. RPO capabilities, like many other dual use capabilities, could therefore be both a positive and a negative, and could could have both positive and negative implications depending on how they are used. It is therefore clear that the important consideration when examining the drivers of security risk and threats Is behavior. It is in this context that we have proposed with Germany a clear norm on rendezvous and proximity operations. Such operations, if conducted without consent or without transparency, communications and consultations, increases tensions and mistrust for developing countries. This evokes further a further sense of insecurity given that our modest space-based assets have no maneuverability and limited situational awareness. As Brazil said, if the security environment reaches a point that requires satellites to be maneuverable, it would increase the cost of peaceful uses of other space for developing countries and that cost would be on the basis of security and strategic concerns. We are therefore delighted that our recommendation for states not to conduct or knowingly support rendezvous operations without consent and not to conduct or knowingly support proximity operations that impair the safe operation of space systems of another state is shared by many other delegations including France and Japan and the supported by delegations such as Switzerland and Turkey. Like many other recommendations, we believe that these recommended norms provide concrete expression to the legally binding duty of jury guard. Finally, returning to our interactive dialogue. Today we would like to stress our position that there is a clear overlap between our work here and the work stream related To the COP was a work stream and there are areas that where we can take inspiration from some of the outcomes of that work streams. It is therefore important that our work is informed by what is happening in corpus and also vice versa. But as our discussions indicate, safety and security are two sides of the same coin. If safety hazards result in consequences that bear upon national security interests of a state as it perceives them these hazards become a security concern and is therefore within the remit of the discussions of this OEWG. I thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M560,3,5,United States,"Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Chairman. You're stuck with me, not the distinguished ambassador. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to provide the United States views on topic 3 on norms, rules and principles relating to operations involving dual use capabilities.  At our last session, we had a series of thoughtful panel presentations, including a listing of potential dual use satellites by Miss Raji Rajagopalan. And an interesting discussion on the potential to further distinguish our use of terms like dual use by delineating another categorization of dual-purpose space systems from Unitiers, Amundeia, Oscarate, Ortega. As many states at the OEWG have noted, it is challenging to determine whether a system is being used for purely civilian activities, for purely military activities, or for some combination of both Additionally, in an environment of mistrust, it is possible that states could feel threatened by the behavior or potential behavior of dual use systems. At the same time, dual use capabilities such as active debris removal or on orbit servicing systems have the ability to enhance the sustainability of the outer space environment. The presentation from our last session by Miss Aya I Amado from Astro Scale is an excellent example of the opportunities and challenges we face when discussing dual use systems. On orbit servicing satellites will allow for the extension of the life of satellites and in the future may be able to repair and build satellites in orbit. Active debris removal satellites will have the ability to maneuver or deorbit non-operational satellites, rocket bodies and other debris, thereby helping to preserve the long term sustainability of the outer space environment. Some on orbit demonstrations have included the use of a net, a harpoon or a magnet to accomplish this task Just as we talk about robotic arms as a possible counter space weapon, robotic arms could also be used for this type of on orbit servicing activity. This capability to grapple another satellite is inherently dual use Such a capability could be used to repair, service or dispose of a satellite Or alternatively, to degrade or destroy another satellite, If we seek to create overly broad definitions of weapons that include the ability to quote, destroy, damage, or disrupt the normal functioning, End Quote of a satellite, or seek to constrain these behaviors, we might end up inadvertently constraining the development of these promising systems. Alternatively, we could be creating a situation where misunderstandings or disinformation about these systems could lead to miscalculations or an increase in tension. As an example, at our last meeting, our Chinese colleagues raised their concerns about AUS companies on orbit servicing craft known as the Mission Extension Vehicle. Our Chinese colleagues specifically called this system a weapon. The MEV, as it is known, is designed to dock with the customers existing satellite and take over the propulsion and attitude control functions in order to extend the life of the that satellite. This company has twice conducted this type of operation and each time did so in an open and transparent manner. There are multiple fact sheets on every aspect of this system. You can go on YouTube and watch the actual video of the MEV as at rendezvous with a communications satellite and prepares to dock. It is quite impressive. But this is a clear example of how a dual use system might be viewed as a weapon by 1 country. However, in order to facilitate discussions at this meeting, I would encourage our Chinese colleagues to explain, as our Indian colleagues mentioned How they made this decision and what they find the most concerning about the MEVs behavior And how they reached that judgment that it was a weapon. This is especially important since China appears to be developing a very similar system called She-Jin 21 or SJ21. That has only been described as being used to quote, test and verify space debris mitigation technologies, Rather than learn about its functions and intentions through additional PRC transparency, the behavior of SJ 21 was only detected by military, civil and commercial space situational awareness systems. The world watched as SJ21 rendezvoused with a derelict Chinese navigation satellite and maneuvered that satellite into the graveyard orbit. That seems very similar to the mission of me To provide the ability to move a satellite into a different orbit. So how are we to understand the differences between these two systems such that China can declare me as a weapon, but presumably would argue that SJ 21 isn't. This is a particularly important question when China did not take any transparency measures related to the purpose and intent of this system. Additionally, some delegations at the open-ended working group have called for prohibitions on using civil space systems for military purposes, That is simply not possible All of our militaries use dual use systems to provide support. Take satellite communications for example. Only a very small handful of countries have access to dedicated military satellite communications capabilities. Yet many of our militaries take advantage of the ability to use commercial satellite communications. For example, the navies of many of our countries use Inmarsat satellite communications antennas. For Etsy communications Stopping militaries from using at sea communications could stop beneficial uses such as counter piracy and humanitarian assistance and disaster response activities. A second example of the inadvertent impacts from creating such a ban would be the inadvertent restriction of compliance with the Outer Space Treaty. Many militaries do not possess space situational awareness capabilities but are launching satellites Stopping militaries from acquiring commercial space situational awareness information that is required to fly their satellites safely could hamper the ability of states to comply with their Outer Space Treaty obligations of due regard Instead of developing legally binding restrictions that could impact the development of these systems or attempting to ban the use of commercial systems for military purpose. We would propose that states consider elaborating general principles of responsible behavior that could help reduce the risk of miscalculation and misunderstanding regarding the operations of such systems. The United States proposal, now labeled C, in our working paper, talks about operating from to and through space in a safe and professional manner. As discussed throughout the open-ended working group, including by a number of nations during this session And including, as set out in the paper by our Philippines, German and Nigerian colleagues.",0
S3M562,3,5,Russia,"What's but esteemed chairperson the Russian Federation considers Outer space as an exclusively peaceful environment, Space vehicles Execute numerous and very varied functions. This includes supporting communications Research into the surface of the Earth And the Near Earth Space orbit and much more Satellites in orbit And also space systems and equipment. By their very nature, can be deployed. Both for peaceful and military purposes. Therefore, any assessment of dual use potential Should be conducted on the basis of the actual capabilities To be found in the very design of such systems and devices Or the actual ways in which they are practically used? I pretty concept Of assessing the intentions behind use Could be subjected Without any problem to various forms of abuse. I believe this is true because Intentions themselves May not Comply with reality Or fall in line with actual actions. Either deliberately or accidentally Moreover, the very concept of intent Is something that could be abuse because it will never be clear who will be establishing or ascertaining intents, who will be the judge of what intentions there are or were behind one or other action Who would be that appeals judge? Who would define and rule whether an action and an intention behind it are both responsible or irresponsible, as a number of states have attempted to present these are The words that come to mind. That it is the road to hell that is paved with good intentions. Therefore, As we've already said We need to conduct assessments of potential on the basis of two key factors. The first Is the potential and capabilities produced by the design of such devices And the second is the actual facts of the use of such infrastructure As regards the first factor. If any space object or any component of it Is created or retrofitted For the destruction Harm Or violation of the normal functioning of objects in outer space Or on the surface of our planet, or in our atmosphere?  And also, for the destruction of human beings Components of our biosphere important for the existence of human beings Or to cause harm to them And the actions of which are based on any physical principles. Then such an object should be seen as a space weapon. We cannot hear talk of any kinds of intentions There is no room to talk about any specific application of such objects. Such space objects were designed and created from square one as weapons for the specific targets and objectives that I just listed and that is how we must view such an object. As regards those objects which were not created or retrofitted to perform such functions. Here indeed we can apply the second factor. That is assessing the specific. Facts of actual practical use of such objects And this factor therefore will not contradict in any way with the approaches that a number of states are attempting to present here. In this case, we would be talking not about potential We will be talking about specific concrete acts performed with the assistance of a specific space, object or device and here We must talk about Any hostile acts Against space objects Including those into Alia Aimed at destroying them, harming them. Temporarily or permanently disrupting the normal functioning of them Deliberately changing the orbit parameters of them Or creating a threat to perform such actions. Now these such actions must be considered as the use of force Or the threat of the use of force against space objects, or using such objects. Therefore, as I already stated A number of states have attempted to present that there's some contradiction or discrepancy, some kind of dichotomy Between considering specific Outer space potentials and some other so-called behaviorist approach these theses Cannot be substantiated and are not viable, Because these two approaches Are fully compatible Between themselves, there's no discrepancy or contradiction between them, and they are compatible in the way that I have attempted to clearly lay out and describe for you just now. In order to restrict the possible use of dual space outer space objects as mentioned above. We need to adopt legal obligations To ban the placement of weapons in space. That is the first category of equipment which was from square one, designed or later retrofitted to perform hostile functions As I listed previously, and also, We need the appropriate legal obligations to ban the use of force or the threat of use of force against space objects or using such objects. That is a ban on the list of actions which I mentioned as the second factor and which can directly Affect dual use space objects. Without developing such legally binding norms. Attempts to restrict such activities by states Using dual use systems Via the concept of intent or intentions Cannot hope to be successful in any way and would only create More problems to maintaining security and safety in space. They would create A serious opportunity for abuse as well as disingenuous interpretations of such activities as I previously said, intentions can be interpreted in very different ways and they may look initially very different. They may intentions may differ greatly from actual actions in the real world. In developing various voluntary norms in the form of transparency and confidence building measures, which Create restrictions for the military use of elements of outer space infrastructure Should be based only on the short-term temporary character of use, Otherwise, They will not only be ineffective They will be counterproductive for ensuring Safety and security in outer space. Therefore, we consider the thesis of certain Western states on the importance of identifying responsible and irresponsible behaviour as unsubstantiated if they are separated from intentions. This because, as I already said, such a completely subjective qualification opens up the door for illegitimate sanctions action. Against individual sovereign states And in this way creates serious barriers to the peaceful use of space by individual states or groups of states. In certain cases, the jewelry use of satellites, for example, the use of commercial satellite systems to support combat troops Blurs the border between military and civilian use And this makes international cooperation harder in the area of peaceful exploitation and use of outer space. This increases the potential for conflict in space as well as the likelihood of direct collisions Within the framework of the topics we're discussing, we would like once again to emphasize the high danger. That goes beyond the innocent use of outer space technologies, specifically the trend that we've clearly seen during the crisis in Ukraine. I'm talking about the repeated use by the USA and its allies of civilian space infrastructure components, including Commercial infrastructure for military purposes. The deployment of this infrastructure. Which ultimately Leads to the destruction Or harm of civilian infrastructure on the planet surface.  In essence Such Acts Are participation by such states in an armed conflict. We learned yesterday and became convinced of the fact that certain states are still not yet aware of this. The so-called quasi civilian infrastructure Can Become a legitimate target for response strikes. As a result of the actions of Western states, there is an unjustified Risk for sustainable, peaceful space activities as well as numerous economic and social processes across the planet, which are vital for the welfare of people, above all in developing countries As a minimum such provocative use of civilian satellites Raises questions about the compliance with obligations That flow from the Space Treaty Which stipulates The exclusively peaceful use of outer space And Calls for the most austere condemnation by the international community. In the context of discussion on dual use technologies, there's another urgent issue which is regulating the eradication of outer space debris, We have seen that for western states the question of space waste is a high priority, even a higher priority than the non-placement of weapons in space. The non-use of force or threat of use of force against objects or using space objects And more generally, the prevention of an arms racing outer space. Here it's important to understand that the unsanctioned actions against the devices of a sovereign state that is without permission from the owner of such space vehicles Is totally unacceptable. The Russian Federation Has actively promoted this thesis in the working group on long term. Sustainable space activities as a part of discussion of the cluster of problems around space activities, which fully falls under the competency of the UN Committee on Outer Space Corpus. At the current stage, a number of questions around space operations remain unresolved and they include the following Implementing the practice of self-restrictive measures Preventing Intervention or interference in the use of space objects, Preventing modifications of the environment, Respecting the security of foreign earth and information systems and infrastructure Active elimination Safely conducting measures to eradicate infrastructure. The appropriate resolution for eradication or destruction with respect to unregistered space objects. All of these questions which are discussed in Vienna as a part of the working group on a long-term sustainability of space activities Hardly need to be reviewed again here at the OEWG. We are convinced that we should not interfere with the work of our colleagues in Vienna and we should not impair their work, which is as yet uncompleted Instead of doing that, we should take the achievements work accomplished by Corpus and actively use those results within this working group. If it is applicable and justified for the execution of the tasks presented before us and for implementing our mandate, Specifically in order to develop recommendations. In the text of Preventing an Arm Space in Arms Race in Outer Space specifically, resolving this task is something which we should focus our efforts on And the document, possibly with recommendations. That we Envisage adopting as a result of the work at the OIG. Thank you very much for your attention. The text was not supplied to the interpreters.",4
S3M564,3,5,Iran,"To the chair for this morning meeting with so far, and I had the intention to keep silence, to actually listen carefully to what other colleagues are saying, Of course, before me, distinguished representative of the Russian Federation has put some difficult elements of this issue of dual use capability so far, in particular supporting. His view regarding, That to what extent? This dealing with the issue through through a perceptions or misperceptions and based on behavioural approach would have a lot of side effects for the developing countries. Peaceful use of outer space, which is Now very needed in the everyday life of countries. So far this issue of operations involving dual use capability in our view is among the very complex issues that require careful examination. Some states of course this morning addressing this issue in the context that rendezvous and approximately operations. Which is their concern and therefore they recommend that any such operations are going to happen. If it is going to happen, it should be by prior consent. Of other states that have the capability in outer space. Of course this is one of the aspect of the dual use capabilities. So but so far however, Experience has shown that discussion of dual use capability and other disarmament fora has resulted in exerting 2 policies of restrictions and export controlled by developed countries against developing countries. That would hamper their peaceful use Exploration and use of outer space and that is the outer space activity which is now very needed for their daily life. We are of the view that resorting to dual use capability context might be converted to a tool in hands of some to exert to discrimination policies. So, taking into account dual use capability, it might be in the context of behavioral approach would lead to misleading policies. Therefore, instead of instead of such a such a denial approaches that comes from such a behavioral approach. I think we should resort to assurance and reassurance approaches through legal norms rather than behavioral approach. Instead of behavioral approach we should think of Legal norms rather that is why we are so much insisting of negotiating of a legal binding instrument and the issue of dual use capability is the one that might Be based on arbitrary judgment and so far this morning the issue of intent was addressed. The issue of intent is also very complex. So far, experience of other international instruments like CWC has shown that although CWC has been entered into force. More than 20 years and it was the careful and very explicit Commitment of developed countries that after the CWC is entered into force, such export control policies would be removed. But experience has shown that the export control policies has kept and yet after 20 years that issue remains of course my delegation in that for us given a very extensive working paper so far And we have recommended that instead of denial approach, reassurance approach should be taken into account and if any export control is needed, it should be multilateral and negotiated by all state parties. This issue also applies to the issue of outer space, that we are on the threshold of expanding actually activity of all countries, including developing countries. In the in the in the outer space, therefore in our view Discussing the dual use capability is to pursue ultimately the strategy of denial, which in our view is doomed to failure. Such as strategy seeks to prohibit access to some technologies and tools that can become becomes in the mind of those have resorting to export control that those are weapons. The strategy seeks to prevent possible capabilities that can threaten the opposite country. Therefore, it seeks to limit The critical assets and capacities of developing countries of whether they seek such a goals or not. A denial strategy, equally exclude an opponent from taking undesirable action, but it does not pursue to do so by alerting an opponent's mind. Instead, the protagonist merely puts Opponents objective out of reach irrespective of whether the opponent selects to pursue it. A physical wall typifies it. Denial measure. It hampers and opponents attacks without transferring to opponents leaning to attack. In other type of denial strategy, a protagonist acts to limit an opponent's capacity to project power by destroying critical assets belonging to the opponent. Therefore, for such a reasoning and argument, we believe that the issue of capable dual use capability should be examined in the context that what will be the end result of such policy as it is followed. Therefore, we believe that this should be discussed in terms of the negotiation of a legal binding document so far as I have the floor. Also, should refer to the discussion. Long term sustainability in the CORPUS that 21 guidelines of the LTS Consisted of two other parts, that is the capacity building that in terms of its definition includes also transfer of technology and also international cooperation is part and parcel of the 21 guideline that is. Under discussion in the long term sustainability Therefore, the issue of military use as well as peaceful use are two sides of a coin, and we should be very careful when examining such a concepts here in the context of the OEWG. Thank you so much.",2
S3M566,3,5,Korea,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. We were also hesitant to jump in because we were very keen to hear the opinions of other Member States here on the development of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors. We would also like to begin by Agreeing to the statements or remarks made by the previous speakers, first of all we also view that space should be a space. That has to be left exclusively for peaceful purposes It's relieving to hear that all the countries are reaffirming that principles. And 2nd, we have to also assert that we are not a Western country and then we have been making our position, but we wanted to clarify again on our views of the OEWG. We agree that intentions are subjective and they are hard to observe. That's why we have been proposing to take our approach based on based on observable behavior And coming back to the dual use nature of the issues. It will be very difficult for us to conceive at this moment what kind of weapons or technology will be a fully and 100%. For military purposes, these were in the disarmament area. WMDS and Certain weapons under CCW Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Had that meaning because WMDS served for no other purpose than for destruction and for military purposes. And in terms of space have very there are verification limits because of the perhaps technological limits we have So that's why we were opposed to the idea of the fully capability based approach and we have been supporting the this OEWG approach and in terms of what is responsible and irresponsible, the RK does not Request to prescribe any behavior as such, but we are keen to hear the opinions of all the Member States here to develop a common understanding on what can be responsible and what are not And while we are open, as we mentioned from the very first OEWG to the idea of working towards the development of legally binding treaties on outer space, we also believe that premature move towards that direction can in fact Prescribe a curve, legitimate and peaceful uses of outer space And also, while we have no intention of infringing on the debates in the CORPUS, as we have mentioned, no activities or technology. Are all the technology and activities so far seem to have dual use characteristics that have security implications? That is the very value of this OEWG and, as our distinguished Filipino colleague said, is in the remit of this body. Now I think this is the reason why we have seen resolutions in the first committee and have held first combined sessions of the 1st and 4th committees in the UN and as so far we see a great convergence on the idea of developing a pre notification system Mechanism that will help to reduce space threats and for activities that have the security implications. I'll stop it here. Thank you.",4
S3M568,3,5,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for an opportunity to take the floor again. I wanted to comment on what our Korean colleagues just mentioned and also a bit on what our Russian colleagues were mentioning as well. One of the important activities that we're doing here at the open-ended working group is developing a common understanding on what activities we as states could find concerning threatening, risky in outer space. And it is through this process of having this conversation that we can enable our countries to have those conversations, whether bilaterally or multilaterally. When we do find activities that we think are concerned and so that is why in my thinking that when we when we work towards these common understandings of what behaviors we are concerned about, we're not judging. We are not saying that we decide. We are saying let's have a conversation between our states. To say This is why I feel something is concerning and you please tell me why you don't think it is concerning, so that we can enhance communications between States and avoid risks of misunderstandings and misperceptions. Thank you.",2
S3M570,3,5,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We would also like to take the floor a second time in order to continue this interactive discussion Concerning a very important set of questions, and that is why we're here after all. We are not opposing the point of view that was just set out by the delegates of the United States of America Indeed, we are trying to define Those potential hazards or dangers in outer space threats, which Exist And on that basis to find possible measures in order to neutralize those and remove them But Distinguished US colleagues, it seems, have forgotten an important aspect In connection With those efforts that we are engaged in and proposing and within The context of which these efforts should be undertaken As set forth in Geo resolution 76231 and In paragraph 6C thereof And that is in specific terms, the fact that there's efforts by our countries should be aimed at Developing legally binding instruments And that those undertakings should Be within the context of resolving challenges around prevention of an arms race in outer space. That is the understanding That lay behind this resolution in our view and the understanding That the majority of your Member States supports, I thank you for your attention.",2
S3M572,3,5,United Kingdom,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And yeah, just in the spirit of continuing this interactive. Discussion I thought it would be useful just to comment on a couple of points which for the UK delegation are are really fundamental to the work of this this group. I think we're really getting to the heart of some of the kind of core issues underpinning. The responsible behaviours approach and why we're all here this week And the first point I wanted to pick up on was this, this idea that's been expressed that somehow voluntary non-binding norms of and rules and principles Are somehow counterproductive or undermine the existing legal framework. In that respect, I would pick up on an observation from our colleague from the Philippines who noted That several suggestions put forward by Member States. For how we might develop new norms of behaviour around, for example, rendezvous and proximity operations, help us to interpret the legal principle of due regards Presumably no one would argue that having a clearer interpretation And a mutual understanding of that legal principle somehow undermines the legal framework. To us, that just doesn't make sense. On the issue of dual use capability The behavioural approach very much addresses the concerns which our Iranian colleague was expressing. It recognizes that it is not sufficient and often undesirable, to seek to place limitations on capability. Rather, we need standards of behavior which encourage restraint and which help to clarify the intent of the user of such capabilities And this dual use issue, thirdly, Mr. Chair, also goes to the heart of why it is so problematic to define To define a weapon in space And our Russian colleague Seems to be arguing that we should seek to ban systems which have only from the outset, been designed for harmful or destructive purposes. As our colleague from the Republic of Korea said, it's rather challenging To come up with examples of such systems, but we've heard many, many examples of Systems which? Have civilian purposes, but which also could be repurposes repurposed With malign intent. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S3M574,3,5,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. During the past two days Many colleagues made reference to the IHL and its applicability in outer space. Therefore, China would like to use the right to reply To make statements specifically on this subject. The AHL is aimed at setting a series of rules to limit the humanitarian effects of armed conflict, Therefore, it is also known as the laws of war or the law of armed conflict. China has by several times stressed that One of the focuses of IHL is to formulate rules for war Rather than preventing us or keeping us from wars Pending the conclusion of a Comprehensive and integrated outer space arms control Treaty Only emphasizing the applicability of outer space Will not only send a strong signal to the international community Nor does it conform with the objective and purposes of the OEWG And may easily cause misperception or miscalculation or exacerbate tensions On specific issues. Can IHL fully and how can it be applied to outer space? There are still many legal challenges. Here I'd like to invite The expert on outer space law, Professor Wang Guo Yu, to make a statement And to offer a legal analysis of the issue of applicability of IHL. There will be many legal terms involved So as not to hamper understanding, may we allow Professor Wang to make his statement in English? Thank you, Mr. Chair, Distinguished representatives, as a Chinese delegate here, and I would like to be the blog between you and the lunch. I will try to make it briefly in the context of the legal challenges to the applicability of HL in space. I'd like to give some examples, and it should be noted that my views are without protrudes to the Chinese Position that it is inappropriate to discuss the applicability of the actual in space scenario at this working group first. The terms like weapons, attack, armed conflict are the basic concepts of HL and the recognition of these terms are always the prerequisite to apply HL However, as we know, the definitions of space weapon, space armed conflict, the use of force in space, have not been formally and deeply discussed. Among all delegations, although some proposals have been presented in PPWT To this end, it would be too early to conclude that HL is fully applicable in space. Second, it is still controversial about whether and to which extent the distinction principle and proportionality principle apply in space scenario. We know they are the core principles of HL Pursuant to the distinction principle, the only legitimate object which states should endeavor to accomplish during war is to weaken the military forces of the enemy. The parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives, and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives. When the civilian object or facility is used for military ends, it becomes a military objective through the youth criterion, however, in space scenario, most of the satellites as just mentioned by so many colleagues have to use function. It is hard to tell whether it is for civilian or military purpose in general. One might argue that space infrastructure use both for civilian and military purposes should be defined as a military objective. Then I'm afraid that it might lead to an excessive application of the distinction principle. It means that most of the satellites, maybe all of the satellites, could be lawful targets in armed conflict. Or, On the contrary, one state might insist a clear cut. Between civilian and military objectives and any attacks against civilian objective violate the distinction principle, even if it serves for military purpose occasionally Then it excludes the possibility to strike such an objective in the legal means, which again might be a wrongful application of this principle Besides, the applicability of principle of proportionality is facing huge challenges as well, according to Article 5157 of Additional Protocol 1. Attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of saving life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantages anticipated Is to be considered as indiscriminate attack and should be prohibited. Those who plan to decide upon attack shall refrain from deciding to launch any such attack In fact, I'm the conflict in space. Will be disastrous in this regard, since a large amount of space debris is always inevitable concomitant with space armed conflicts And space debris could destroy any object nearby or in its trajectory without any discrimination. That is, no matter it is a civilian, satellite or military one Under such circumstances, How to fully apply the principle of proportionality? To this end, suppose one state hold that proportionality principle is fully applicable in space. Does it mean it also holds that any means and methods of space warfare which can generate space debris is unlawful and shall be prohibited? If so, does it mean this state has no right to defense before it owns the soft killing capabilities? 3rd It might be debatable as well About the applicability of the law of neutrality in some space scenario, considering our dear colleagues from the Netherlands mentioned Women Run menu for several times, I'd like to introduce the relevant article in this menu, although it is not officially endorsed or accepted by all delegations. EU 52 is titled Law of Neutrality and Black Letter Rule is read as the Law of Neutrality applies to Military Space operations during international armed conflict. It is further expressed in its commentary that the law of neutrality may provide for space environment that any state nor party to an international armed conflict and seeking to maintain neutral status must remain impartial, abstain from space activity deemed and neutral, and take certain actions to end or prevent belligerent military activities that would violate its neutrality. Failure to fulfill such neutral obligations can therefore lead to a loss of neutral status of an object, person, or state Depending on the circumstances. It might be no disagreement that in the hypothetical case the object like satellite and its services And the person like commercial space company is losing of neutral status when it is directly contributing to the military communication of one of the combatants. However, the key question and the unsettled issue is whether it is subsequently leads to the loss of neutral status of that question state. First, then, the state. Who has jurisdiction over this company or over its space activities? As a space lawyer and researcher, I would be very curious and eager to learn from the answer. Learn the answer from my dear colleagues who claims that HL is fully applicable in space scenario. All in all, it is inappropriate to argue HR is fully applicable in space before we seriously and deeply discuss the legal matters in space. War collateral damage is hard to avoid And any country could be a victim. That's why my delegation strongly argued spacewalk cannot be fought and never been won. The most urgent issue now is to avoid space warfare or any kind of space conflict by legally binding instrument. If one country agreed to formulate the rules of armed conflicts in outer space now, that might be deemed as retrogression of that country's policy arms control in outer space, and also means that this country might be ready to space war and ready to afford the subsequent disastrous consequences. I thank you, Chair.",4
S3M62,3,6,France,"Thank you, Chairman. I'll be very brief.  I would like to come back to the statement about the US this morning when they explained The characteristics of the system that they had developed, the MEV And the concerns that it might potentially spark for other states without tuition to go into the nitty gritty of this subject. This is interesting because it really gets to the heart of the work we're trying to do. We're seeing the system being developed for civilian uses with clear, evident interest that may give rise to concern from certain states. Today and within this group, what we are trying to do and what we should all do, is to express as clearly as possible why certain systems with dual use capability could give rise to concerns. For various people in the room, This is essentially an appeal to all participants here today to try to provide a response to the question raised by the US. Speaking each my own standpoint, Why would one system be posing a problem and why would another not be? I would encourage all states to Offer Up collective responses to this question and to make statements with that in mind. Thank you.",2
S3M64,3,6,Austria,"This is also a statement still under item three of our indicative timetable. Topic three, I'm sorry, On the issue of dual use capabilities, and we hope that we also They all give some in the additional information also to the To the discussion that we had this morning, which was quite engaging, I have to say, Mr. Chair, the dual use of many space objects for military and civilian purposes is a particular challenge, raises several legal and practical questions, and is an inherent risk for civilian objects. This mostly needs to be addressed by transparency and information sharing, but also by fully exploiting existing instruments And where the necessary, establishing complementary measures to further strengthen confidence building measures in a similar way. Problems arising from the dual purpose of space objects, which are not designed to damage other space objects but potentially can be used for that purpose, raise a wide range of concerns which need to be at the centre of our work. While many topics discussed this week can also be addressed from a civilian vantage point in Corpus as, as some delegations have pointed out. This is a question that needs to be addressed against the background of space security And the prevention of an arms race in outer space. We consider this specific problem as one of the main reasons for the existence of the OE WG and it is here where an approach based on behavior and how capabilities are used provides the most added value and addresses a pressing issue. A range of space capabilities can be misused for malign purposes and utilized as weapons. This includes space launch vehicles, small satellites, active debris removal systems, and information technology. In this dynamic area, there is a general need for clarifying the purposes and intended uses of space objects. Therefore, we support strong norms against any interference with the space systems of other states that would lead to a loss of operational control, damage or loss of space systems of another state. In this regard, we also need to recall that the concept of harmful interference is already set out in the Outer Space Treaty under its Article 9 norms. Rules and principles could contribute an informed state practice in relation to this principle and advance the existing legal framework. On both issues we see a clear necessity to improve information sharing and transparency on the purpose of space objects and the intention of operations. This should include the establishment of new relevant norms, principles or guidelines, but also a strengthened implementation of Article 11 of the Outer Space Treaty, as well as the Convention and Registration of objects launched in the outer space of 1974, and of course, its universalization. Possible measures could include the provision of additional information. Extending beyond enumerating the general purposes as outlined in Article 4/2 of the Registration Convention, But this would of course also require a significant significant capacity increase at UNOSA, with a few to improving information processing and availability In general, and in particular in the context of tool use. We lack multilateral means for attribution and verification related to space objects, which we should rectify inter alia through the means of newly available technology And maybe some additional words on the interactive discussion that we had this morning. It is quite related to the points that we just made on our statement on the dual use capabilities, but we also wanted to state that it is in general a problem that many existing instruments, mechanisms are even principles that are enshrined in the OST do exist And our work here, even though it is related to the work of cope with another instruments, can be a vehicle to reconfirm these recommendations we also have to take. Note or more or less remind colleagues that there is a long list of verifications from different working groups or even expert groups that did their work. On topics that we are discussing here and our task here could also be or our outcome could also be that we reconfirm those kind of recommendations. From a security angle, from a security viewpoint and this is one of the outcomes that this OWT could pro, could produce and we will work towards this goal. And this is just what we wanted to add also on the discussion from this morning. I thank you.",0
S3M66,3,6,Russia,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairperson. At the outset I would like to thank you for your understanding. We would like to continue the discussion of the issue that was raised by the delegation of China during our morning session and specifically the application of international humanitarian law. This is one of the fundamental issues Not just for this session, but the activities of our group as a whole As could have been understood from our presentation of a separate working document on this issue. This cluster of issues is sufficiently important to us as a delegation.",2
S3M69,3,6,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. In the spirit of interactive dialogue, I wish to return to the continuing discussion on the applicability of international humanitarian law, or IHL, given the very lucid insights that are distinguished colleague from the delegation of China provided in his intervention this morning. The gist of the argument, as my delegation understands it, is that the application of IHL presupposes the legitimacy of armed conflict in outer space and therefore undermines the goal Of our multilateral conversation towards the prevention of an arms race in outer space, as we have stressed repeatedly, my delegation has a different perspective. We see that IHL is agnostic to the legality of the use of force or any violation of use at Valium. It is triggered only when an armed conflict breaks out, whether or not the initiation of such an armed conflict is legitimate. This includes armed conflict initiated in violation of the United Nations Charter Or the Outer Space Treaty. We consider also, Mr. Chair, that the dual use nature of space objects make it extremely makes it extremely difficult to exercise the core IHL principle of distinction when conducting on the tax. In outer space. For example, a global positioning systems are used primarily for civilian and commercial purposes, but it could also be used for military purposes in times of armed conflict. An attack on an asset providing GPS services could have severe humanitarian implication on States, not party To that armed conflict. So what this implies is that compliance with IHL is therefore difficult in outer space, and this reinforces our assertion that outer space must not be a domain for armed conflict because the difficulty of ensuring compliance with IHL. You know, makes it makes it politically costly for states to conduct armed attacks in outer space. Space We also note that our distinguished Chinese colleague may raise many legal questions that the application of IHL in outer space might imply. My delegation believes that these questions require focused and specific deliberations of illegal nature, which might transcend the mandate of this OEWG. It is important for these legal considerations to be unpacked by appropriate experts, with the exception of a few delegates from China and the ICRC. The said appropriate experts might not be present in this room. This, however, enhances our argument for the need for this OE WG to affirm the applicability of IHL in its outcome document, because such an affirmation provides a political signal for international experts to unpack the specific legal considerations that such an affirmation might imply. In closing, I wish to reiterate that we believe continuously that there is a balanced middle ground here that could accommodate the very understandable concerns raised by the distinguished Chinese delegations regarding IHL. And you, Mr. Chair, have started an attempt at such a balance in paragraph ten of your Elements paper, and we look forward to engaging constructively in this regard. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M611,3,6,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm glad to see that our comments have provoked a great deal of discussion today and that we can continue that discussion. First of all, I'd just like to make a quick clarification Based on the statement from the distinctive representative from the Russian Federation. It's possible the translation wasn't quite on there, I'm not sure. But what we said this morning was that activities that might not be unlawful can nevertheless be irresponsible if they lead to threats or the perception of threats from other states or. They lead to an escalatory situation that could lead to further disputes or conflicts. There's nothing inconsistent with international law about that position. Just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should do it. And it is certainly not responsible to try to push the line of legality by engaging in ever more provocative conduct until eventually you elicit a response. Rather, it would be much more advisable to open dialogue between countries to discuss what would be considered responsible behaviour. Engage in that behaviour in such a manner that everyone is reassured that your actions are not threatening or not dangerous. With respect to, The reference that I believe the delegate of the Russian Federation made to Article 6 and demilitarization. I think perhaps there was also an error there. I presume that he meant to refer to Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty perhaps, and in that case it should be pointed out that paragraph one of Article 4 does not use the word militarization at all. It is not a demilitarization of outer space in any way. It is simply a prohibition on the placement of a certain discrete form or category of weapons and nothing more. Indeed, militaries have used outer space since the dawn of outer space exploration, and that is not prohibited. By the Outer Space Treaty. Furthermore, simply because there is an article in the UN Charter 2 for the prohibits the use of force doesn't mean that international humanitarian law is unnecessary or does not apply and that is relevant on Earth, Sea, the air, space, and anywhere else that human activities take place. Indeed, it may be somewhat difficult to apply an established body of law to a new domain or a new action. But with respect, that is, the job of lawyers and jurists is precisely to apply international law as it is written, as it is conceived under customer international law to new situations and new human behaviors. We do not shrink from this task or submit that the law no longer applies simply because the new activity has arisen. Instead, we struggle with, we discuss, and ultimately we attempt to arrive, an understanding of how that body of law applies to this new domain of human activity. Therefore, I will reaffirm, as many delegations already have done, as the delegation of the Philippines has done, that international law applies in outer space, which is stated explicitly in Article three of the Outer Space Treaty, and international law does include international humanitarian law, therefore it does apply in space. How it applies Is certainly a concept that we may need to grapple with, but I don't believe that is necessarily the role of this OEWG. Our role is to discuss And perhaps make recommendations on norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors to reduce threats in outer space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M613,3,6,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. At the very beginning on topic three, I wish to make a statement. With regards dual use capability At the outset, still, use nature is not an exclusive feature of Outspace technologies. In fact, in the field of nuclear biology and chemistry. There are also dual use technologies Which nevertheless did not hinder the conclusion of arms control legal instruments. By the international community in order to safeguard the rights of states to peacefully use relevant technologies. It is the same in the field of outer space By using technical means, we are fully capable of defining military and civilian objects and activities. China is in favor of the views expressed by the Cuban delegate during the previous session. That is the dual nature of outspace technology cannot be an excuse to refuse negotiating legal instruments on outer space arms control, nor can it be an excuse to develop and deploy out space weapons. Additionally, The dual nature of commercial space technologies is generating new security risks. In recent years, some commercial space companies are growing their strength rapidly, While expanding their business in the civilian field. They are actively participating in out space military activities. In the form of providing support of intelligence and surveillance as well as military communication, amongst others. An example is the recently reviewed Starshield project by the US company SpaceX. On its website, the company claims that it will cooperate with the US government. In support of its national security, On the website, It writes and I quote Star Shield uses additional High Assurance cryptographic capacity capability to host classified payloads and process data securely. End of quote. UN quote. It is capable of integrating a wide variety of payloads, offering unique versatility to users. End of quote. This announcement has given rise to concerns over the participation of outer space military activities by commercial space companies. Those actions blurred the boundary of military and civilian activities Allowing certain countries to conduct space military buildup under the pretext of civilian use And contributing to the arms race in out space and its weaponization Pursuant to Article 6 of OST State Parties to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in out space carried out by non-governmental entities and for ensuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions set forth in the present Treaty. The activities of the non-governmental entities in outer space shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty. The OWG should thus study in depth political and legal consequences of commercial space companies engagement of military activities And armed conflicts in order to prevent those entities from stepping on the dangerous path of intervening armed conflicts. China is of the view that the OWG should carry out the following study that is pursuing to lex latter and what circumstances should states be responsible for the legal consequences caused by the intervention in other state military conflicts by commercial space activities? In other words, the matter of attribution in international law, as well as how responsibility of authorization and supervision on the Article 6 of OST be accurately defined. Taking this opportunity, China wishes to describe a legal scenario for your reflection. Imagine there is a company that was registered in country A, holds a launching license and has relevant space objects registered in country B. Should this company intervene in the military conflicts between countries C and country D? The following legal issues are in need of clarification. Firstly, which country should bear the legal consequences resulted from the involvement of that company? Should that be the registry state of cooperation or the registry state of the space object, or the state who has jurisdiction over space activities? Or any other countries? Secondly, Suppose state B is not informed of the acts of this company Or not only is it aware of these acts, it encourages and supports the acts of such company? What are the bearings of the two scenarios on the definition of responsibility of country B? Thirdly, Does Country A or Country B have the obligation in their domestic law to clearly prohibit the involvement of relevant commercial companies into international arms? Conflict, armed conflict? And if there were no such provisions? Whether have they contravened to the duty of regulation as stipulated in the Outer Space Treaty? The duty of supervision and the duty of supervision And fourthly Suppose That despite the existence of such prohibitive rules in country A or country B, but the company did not comply with relevant rules And relevant states are not informed of their acts Should these countries still bear the consequences, these legal consequences? And fifth, This case has aroused most deeper questions, which is The public power of a country to which extent should intervene in commercial activities to safeguard national security and International Security while not adding unreasonable burden to commercial space activities Now let's come back to our actual life According to media reports The director of electronic warfare for the Pentagon's acquisition office, David Trumpet Claimed that Starlink has a fantastic performance in electronic warfare And said We need to be able to have that ability, we have to be able to change our electronic magnetic posture.",4
S3M616,3,6,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to continue this interactive conversation. And I want to thank our Chinese colleagues both for their clarification on their statement from the last session and certainly look forward to continuing that conversation. But I also want to thank them for bringing up a really important issue related to strengthening authorization of commercial entities. That is something as all of us governments in the room should really be thinking about to make sure that we are meeting our Outer Space Treaty requirements and obligations And so how we can do more of that that is something that as states we should take away from this, this discussion and start thinking about. And one request I would have for our Chinese colleagues, I apologize, I was not able to write down fast enough your example and where you had some very good questions. And I was hoping that perhaps you could share that with the group afterwards so that we can go back and study those questions and perhaps come back at a future time to have a conversation about that. And the last point I would just like to raise Is about the question about that our Chinese colleagues raised about Starlink and the issue our Chinese colleague is talking about Is that the Starling satellite was experiencing intentional jamming in an effort to deny the ability of entities, both civil and military, to use the Starlink satellite. But because of the way Starlink works, this is the comment that our Department of Defense colleague was making. Was that you? They were impressed about its ability to not be jammed in a conflict? Thank you.",2
S3M618,3,6,France,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to respond to the point made by China. It seems, in fact, that we are in agreement because it was exactly what I said. It is our desire to be in a position to come up with norms of responsible behaviour. To understand what's meant by due regard in the domain of Close contact Always known as RPO operations. Under international law, undertaking A rendezvous operation is not illegal if it is undertaken with the consent, notably of the state concerned. In that case it would not be unlawful, but it could give rise to tensions and as such As part of an operation that did not receive prior consent, it could give rise to tensions And it could be considered that such a practice needs to be duly considered I am pleased to note that China agrees with France as the need as to the need to do this. Thank you.",2
S3M620,3,6,China,"Thank you Chair for the floor. So my delegation, we have learned a lot about the points that. To distinguish responsible, irresponsible, it would just pave the way to define due regard in other spirituality. I am afraid it is not the case. I think it might be not necessary but just redundant approach. As we discussed before, the legal or illegal matter should be defined in the Specific circumstances. On the case by case basis So I believe that whenever when a behavior could be defined as responsible or irresponsible from legal perspective. It could be defined as whether comply with due regard as well. So I don't think this approach from legal perspective it is necessary. Besides, it also makes up The boundary. We say the legal standard and moral standard, it would just undermine the value of international law. However, as we, all of us, just agree that we shall respect international law. Then I'm afraid that would be some contradictory position there. Thank you.",2
S3M622,3,6,Pakistan,"Thank you Chair. We would like to appreciate Your conduct of stating our work and we really appreciate this very interactive discussion that we are having right now under this topic. We find this very useful. We would just like to place on record some of the views that have been expressed here, especially on a couple of points under this topic which would flow in the subsequent topics as well which would come under discussion. Regarding specifically on the dual use capabilities, we do share our delegation share that This issue of dual use capability is not new, is not exclusive only to the outer space domain and we believe that we have had this question in other areas as well. The concern for my delegation and I believe that has been shared previously in other areas by other developing countries as well the dual use capabilities. This issue has often been exploited by certain states for political reasons To deny access. In the peaceful use, in the access of peaceful use of technologies and certainly we have, we have heard voices in this meeting throughout several times during the course of this week and in our earlier sessions as well about the province of all mankind, the global common heritage as well. So the concern that my state, my delegation would have is that to push if there are any attempts to push any norms On the count of responsible behavior in the area of dual use capabilities. The OEWG should ensure that it does not place any obstacles, it does not place any prohibitions or restrictions on the access of peaceful technologies and specifically for space emerging nations which may not have any space. Assets at this point in time, but it should not limit their future right as well, and that's why it's important to take into account this concern that this notion of responsible behaviour is not used. On certain political counts, that's why we have a difficulty understanding of this in this context, specifically on this topic as well. Finally, on another point that has been expressed that yes, we do share the view that militarization of outer space has been happening for a very long time. But the context in which we are meeting at this stage right now is the growing weaponization of outer space and the increasing voices and policies and strategies, strategies and development of capabilities. Which consider outer space is a war fighting domain. So while we do agree on the applicability of International Space international law in outer space that the Outer Space Treaty has affirmed, we are ready to reaffirm that through this OEWG as well. But only picking certain elements, let's say international humanitarian law or law of armed conflict, while not making any progress on the prohibitions of you know. War fighting strategy is a development of those capabilities. That again we would be giving that signal that perhaps we are at this point now where we have accepted that this is the new reality, now we have to regulate this reality. And honestly speaking, my delegation is not at this point in time where we are ready to accept that outer space has transformed into a war fighting domain. So with this I will end my intervention here, but we would share our subsequent views in the next topic on this issue in detail. Thank you.",4
S3M624,3,6,Russia,"Thank you, Chairman. We would also like to join the discussion And first of all, react to the point made by the distinguished representative of Canada. We would like to express gratitude first of all to him. These days For his Clear words. I think he was absolutely right. We were talking about Article 4 and not 6 Eagle eyed there. Thank you. But that does not take anything away from the essence of what we were saying And the argument to the effect that Article 4 Of the Outer Space Treaty Makes reference to demilitarization, partial or full. The fact that it doesn't directly reference it does not mean that that is not what the essence is. We have any number of examples in international law where A given space Is considered as a Demilitarized Zone, But The actual source of that international law Lacks wording expressly to that effect. By way of the most evident example of this I would bring the attention of our Canadian colleague, Article one of the Antarctic Treaty. With regard to the whole entirety being declared A Demilitarized Zone. This article Makes reference to the fact that Antarctica Should be used For purely peaceful ends For people's purposes only And this For the entire legal community Means that Antarctica is a Demilitarized Zone. The same logic applies to Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty As we have said, part of outer space Is declared in Article 4 as a fully Demilitarized Zone Part of that space is declared as a partially Demilitarized Zone, and as I already said. The international community has A clear task Face before it is preventing an arms race and out of space And the use of outer space for entirely peaceful purposes, as enshrined in the preamble of the Outer Space Treaty. In addition, that logic to the effect That if it is not clearly recorded that outer space is not fully demilitarized or partially demilitarized. Then international humanitarian law should be applied to it Does not withstand any criticism and Is logically weak Article Two of the Uncharted Prohibits the use of force, but we see use of force around the world On Earth. Here I should note That international humanitarian law Applies to certain situations Applicable on Earth And specifically to the situation of armed conflict A definition of which is absent in international law And Which does not relate specifically to direct use of force. It's simply a definition, a certain defined situation In international relations. Therefore Invoking your argument that in view of article two of the UN Charter International humanitarian law applies to any relations on earth In the event of conflict is a thesis which in our view Lacks ground Particularly when it comes to application to outer space Where There is an absence of national jurisdiction And Where thus far there has not been a single example of armed conflict and where we hope No such examples we will arise We will do our utmost to achieve this and prevent this from happening Moreover This logic extension does not mean that obligations Concerning the non use of force or the threat of force in space Should exist and that states should not enter into such obligations. Because whirlwinds follow that logic, then there should be no need for Article two of the UN Charter, which is a founding principle, a cornerstone of international law And it is for that reason that our delegation Considers ultimately That in view of the situation today and in view of the situation and a configuration of international relations And in view of the reality as it pertains to space There can be no invocation of armed conflict That is why we, as Member States of the United Nations, have come together in order to adopt the necessary norms Legally binding norms. In order To prevent the emergence of unconflicting outer space In order to prevent the use of force or the threat of force against space objects, or using space objects and in order to prevent Space becoming a beachhead for military aggression or war As on Earth. I thank you for your attention.",4
S3M626,3,6,Canada,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I just want to take a moment, of course, to express my great appreciation for the wonderful compliment paid to me by the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. I appreciate it. And I will apply that Eagle Eye once again to point out that there is actually a very significant difference between Article 1, the Antarctic Treaty and Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty 2. Significant differences, but I mean we can that's for a later date, but one, of course, being that there's an express Mentioned in there that Antarctica shall be used for peaceful purposes only that that's different than what you have for outer space generally. The 2nd is the qualifier of there shall be prohibited any measures of a military nature so that that particular phrase isn't actually in the Outer Space Treaty. So there is a there's a distinguishing feature between those two which has led to a lot of academic debate which is not a subject for this OWG. But I would recommend reading some of that debate and maybe we can have it at another time. But more importantly, what I really wanted to do was amplify the comment made by the distinguished representative Of Pakistan, and particularly his plea that we don't restrict access to certain technologies to emerging spacefaring nations. I I think we've all acknowledged that some technologies that are dual use have extremely beneficial effects and we want to promote and encourage those beneficial effects of those technologies. And it is for this reason why you wouldn't want to ban these technologies for use by any country, but instead regulate the behavior of those who are using those technologies to Lean towards the beneficial nature. And so that's why, from our delegations point of view, focusing on norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior is the better approach. That way we get to still enjoy the benefits of these technologies, and emerging spacefaring nations can also enjoy these benefits while at the same time trying to ensure that these technologies are used in a way that promotes international peace and security. So I think this is a real strong argument in favor of the work we're doing here And I'm sure that all emerging spacefaring nations would greatly appreciate it if one day they will be able to use these technologies to bring the same benefits to their people. Thank you very much.",2
S3M628,3,6,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Regarding the statements made by the Philippines and Canada and by other colleagues regarding the application of the IHL, I would like to make some comments. This morning, the Chinese experts around this issue has made professional analysis and raised some questions as well. However, some colleagues seem to say that These questions can be discussed. Can, can we? We can carry on discussing these problems. From the political point of view. We should first of all determine that the application of the IHL at outer space is valid. This logic is flawed If even the legal issues were not clearly discussed and made clear How can we draw a conclusion hastily. I agree with the statement by the Philippines. Which is we should continue to discuss the related legal issues. The owgs purpose is to maintain the outer space peace and security Instead of setting up rules, Rules of war, Warfare, war. If we Changed the name of Into Armed conflict law or warfare law We could see through the problem in a more clearer way. China is against in any way the spirit of humanitarian law With ICRC, China has also conducted a very friendly exchanges On IHL. However, in the context of OWG, Discussing the IHL or the application of the armed conflicts law in outer space is inappropriate What we should discuss Is the Outer Space Treaty International Telecommunication law States responsibility law And other related laws. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",2
S3M630,3,6,Algeria,"Thank you very much, Mr. President. Allow me to express our appreciation for your conduct of our work and the richness of the current discussion. Following this interesting discussion by delegation, would like to put on the record its views on some points. First of all, as mentioned by other delegations, my country considers that the question of do you must not compromise the legitimate right Of developing countries to peaceful use of space. In our view, our group should take this element into consideration When formulating its conclusions. Secondly, my delegation considers that the focus on the applicability of international humanitarian law in space could lead to legal consequences in contradiction with the nature of the space as an area exclusively Peaceful and free of arms and conflicts. In this sense, it remains vital for our group to reaffirm the validity of international law and its enshrined principles, in particular the principle of space, as a common heritage of of humanity, free of arms and the use or threat of use of force. One of the relevant conclusions that could emanate from our group is the crystallization of a presumption of the exclusivity of peaceful. Militarized character of space So, in other words, acknowledging the principle of supremacy of space over humankind, considerations which implicate that conflicts must never be fought in the space, Thank you very much.",4
S3M632,3,6,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the initiator of the discussion of this topic within the present session of the working group. We would like to dedicate our attention at this time to the issue of norms, rules and principles. With regard to related to the prevention of placement of weapons in outer space, as you are all very well aware, the Russian Federation has been consistently calling for the preservation of outer space As A place for purely peaceful purposes for all states on an equal footing Our core position Which has existed for a number of decades now Is unchanged. It is To ensure Achievement of these goals. This is only possible through the elaboration of universally recognized, legally binding principles and norms of international law Which would be universal in nature, and which would be intended to prevent An arms race in outer space As provided for in the first special session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1978 on disarmament. The year-on-year growth in risk of space becoming a beachhead for aggression and war. It's only serving to confirm the relevance of this work. We affirm And renew our concern at the undertaking by states of the West, headed by the United States of America Of the policy to place weapons in space and use outer space. For undertaking military activity With a view to ensuring their dominance of space and superiority. We note the large scale programs being undertaken in order to elaborate Systems for the intended for the use of force or threats of use of force in outer space or from space. We call upon Western states to cease attempts to turn outer space into a new arena for conflict between states as well as rivalry, and to refrain from further efforts Including attempts or endeavours to place weapons in space And To take on the appropriate obligations. We consider symptomatic That goals and steps of this nature Have not been referred to at all in the working document made available for review in the course of the session by the United States. This is regrettable, to say the least We have already noted. The Fact that space technology is Pursuing, pursued, untrammeled, and we have seen how it has been used in another week in in the course of the events in Ukraine And it's I'm talking here about the use of outer space And components of civilian infrastructure and add to space which fall outside. The jurisdiction of the United States and then NATO partners For military ends In order to inflamed conflict on earth. Once again, we wish to affirm that such acts are deserving of the utmost concerning condemnation by the international community. The Russian Federation is convinced that at this stage it is still possible To prevent the initiation of a full-fledged arms race in outer space. Before it is too late Despite The numerous attempts To suggest that outer space can be considered as an arena For conflict And military activity. It is our view That Our core challenge and task as responsible members of the United Nations Organization Is To really prevent Space becoming this form of beachhead for aggression and war. Therefore, for this purpose, we are renewing our call to Member States of the UN to confirm their commitment to current international law provisions regulating activities in outer space. This includes The 1967 Treaty, The Outer Space Treaty, Article Four of which Stipulates corresponding measures. For the full demutilization Of outer one part of outer space and partial demilitarization of another part of space And also registers an approach which is aimed at the exclusively peaceful use and activities in space. However, this alone is not enough This international Legal foundation has a number of gaps which need to be closed On the whole, the set of international laws needs to be shored up. This is what led to our Approach which has been consistent On adopting at national and international levels Various commitments Stating that outer space including near Earth orbits and on celestial bodies Must not be a place where any form of weapons is located, and there should also be a ban on the use of force or the threat of the use of force. With respect to space objects, or indeed using space objects And on the whole, record a generalized ban on strike weapons intended for striking space objects. We believe That If we want to keep outer space free of all forms of Weaponry Guarantees for this purpose to prevent an arms race in outer space laid out in international legislation documents And the resolution of issues and questions around the peaceful use of space As well as maintaining safety for space activities Is not possible. There without any perspectives We already have a foundation for launching such negotiations The Russian-Chinese Draft treaty Preventing the placement of weapons in outer space, The use of force or the threat of use of force against space objects. We urge the critics of this draft to take a constructive position And at the very least, to present their own specific proposals for how they believe it may be improved With respect to preventing replacement of weapons in space We have already voiced Specific obligations Which UN member States should assume It has the following form specifically to not create Not use and not deploy weapons in outer space To execute any tasks Including for anti-missile defense. As anti-satellite systems, For the use against targets on the planets surface Or in the planets atmosphere Such definitions of space weapons Are listed in the draft Treaty on the prevention of placement of weapons in space, The use of force or threat of use of force against based objects As we voiced today. What we're talking about Is the space object or any component part thereof Which is Designed, created, or retrofitted for striking, damaging or destroying, Harming or violating the normal functioning of objects in outer space Or on the Earth's surface or atmosphere And to destroy human beings Components of the biosphere vital for human life Or to cause damage there too And which activities are based on any physical principles, In order to study and present recommendations on the substantive elements of a multilateral, legally binding document on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to prevent the placement of weapons in outer space On the initiative of Russia and other states. A resolution was adopted by the UN General Assembly 77 20 55255.250 And subsequent practical steps on preventing the placement of weapons in outer space. This document Stipulates a renewal of the work of the group of government experts on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and we expect that one of the issues for consideration by this group Will also be As for this open-ended working group. The cluster of issues around the placement of weapons in outer space. I would like immediately to clarify That the activities of this group of governmental experts that I mentioned Must be considered Not as some kind of alternative to the activities of our own OEWG. On space but Conversely, We expect to use the achievements of the open-ended working group And use the impulse that has been created For activities of the future, Gigi To be as comprehensive as possible, as effective as possible. So that the independent government experts Would have all the more food for thought Therefore, we are counting on the work of this governmental group of experts To be begun after the last session of the OEWG that is this group That is to say, no earlier than September of this year. Preferably in November of this year, We would also like to mention. One other well-known initiative launched by the Russian Federation and aimed at stabilizing the situation in the period of while a multilateral, legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space Will be under development And that is The initiative for political obligations Or commitments On the non-placement, non-first placement of weapons in space. The full format participants of this initiative Are now numbering more than three dozen countries, and the number of supporters of this approach is constantly growing. We consider this initiative To be a foundation Which falls in line with transparency and confidence building measures With Respect to a specific form of activity Which is specifically the placement of weapons in outer space Which, in compliance with the provisions of this initiative And the political commitments stipulated by it Must be prevented No placement, no first placement of weapons in space Should take place. Therefore In general, any placement of weapons in space will be prevented. We urge all states to join this initiative and to assume the corresponding commitments. Thank you.",4
S3M634,3,6,Pakistan,"Thank you, Chair. Specifically on this item, we would like to highlight that Pakistan has been consistently highlighting the risks of weaponization in outer space which threaten the long-term sustainability of peaceful space activities. The use of force against space objects, the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems and their integration into space assets have added a worrying dimension to the issues relating to outer space. We understand that while the Outer Space Treaty banned the placement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in outer space, it did not prohibit the placement of weapons other weapons in outer space. Therefore, we believe that there is an urgent need to address gaps in the international legal regime governing the exploration and use of outer space, with the view to ensuring that no one threatens the peaceful activities and applications of space technologies. For socio economic development.  With this in mind, Pakistan has been supporting the initiative of non-placement of weapons in outer space. In 2019, we outlined our commitment through a bilateral declaration on no first placement of weapons in Outer space. In that declaration, we also highlighted our commitment to refrain from the threat or use of force in outer space activities. We encourage other responsible spacefaring nations to follow this example While discussing norms, rules and principle, the open-ended working group should call for issuing aggressive space fighting doctrines and policies that aim for strategic dominance in outer space. It is worrying to our delegation that some states openly call for extending concepts like deterrence to outer space. The OEWG should clearly call upon states to shun pursuit of concepts such as deterrence, which would have no role in outer space. The OEWG should also advance norms on the prohibition of stationing of all kinds of weapons in outer space. Through this OWG, the states should reaffirm. The states should affirm that their commitment to negotiate a legally binding treaty on the prohibition of stationing of weapons in outer space. We believe that this has been a long overdue item on our disarmament agenda, and there is an urgent need to make progress on this. Given the development of our recent times, I thank you, Chair.",4
S3M636,3,6,Cuba,"Thank you, Chairperson. On this topic, our delegation would like to indicate that the agreements in force on arms control in connection with extra atmospheric space, including bilateral agreements, are essential To guarantee that space exploration is conducted in a peaceful manner. We respect The approach that demands that states do not place weapons, including weapons of mass destruction, in space or on celestial bodies Or indeed, on the surface of the earth, the legal regime in place must be respected to the letter. This is why my delegation supports the adoption Of a treaty banning the placement of any kind of weapons in space. We call on all parties to proceed as fast as possible On work on the basis of what was already done in 2004. We repeat, our position already stated that the major impacts that such devices and weapons can have and there can be no justifiable pretext for delaying work on such A treaty and its draft for a legally binding instrument, it is indispensable that we put in place transparency and confidence building measures. But this is not substitute for a legally binding instrument. The commitment for the non-first placement of weapons in space is an important measure. My delegation is Fully favourable to this, and it's a part of the broader approach to prevent the placement of weapons in general in space. We urge those who have not yet done so to assume commitments to this effect, the placement of weapons and the militarisation of space with the development and honing of new weapons in this area are the main threat that we see. We therefore commend the work that has been done and the presence of this issue on our work programme. Outer space should be used exclusively for peaceful ends. This is why we cannot allow the placement of weapons in space, thank you,",4
S3M638,3,6,China,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. China's off the view that preventing the placement of weapons in out space is an inevitable requirement and effective measure for preventing arms raising out space And is therefore of great significance to maintaining security in outer space. From the perspective of international law Weapon is always associated with the use of force and armed attack. The deployment of weapons can be considered as preparation for the use of force and armed attack, and in some cases a precondition to deploy weapons in the out space, we are not only cause arteries in the out space but also create tensions Increase the possibility of misperception and miscalculation, or even giving rise to armed conflicts. If we do not clearly prohibit the placement of weapons in outer space, Then it is impossible for us to rule out the possibility of direct use of weapons in the out space To develop norms, rules and principles relating to the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space Will help to fill the current gaps in the legal system And create conditions for the conclusion of relevant legal instruments through negotiation Like SLATA in the out space only prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons and other WMD's in the outer space Without restricting the placement of conventional weapons. What's more, the definition of WMD still has some ambiguities in relevant UNGA resolutions of 1948 and 1977. WMD has been defined to include atomic, explosive weapons, radioactive material weapons, lethal chemical and biological weapons And any weapons developed in the future which have characteristic comparable indestructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons. On the basis of this definition, If a weapon cannot produce destructive effect that is comparable to atomic bombs Even if it can produce relatively large destructive effects. It cannot be defined as WMD An example is that during the Cold War, a country put forward the project saw That is to launch kinetic projectiles made from tungsten from Earth orbit to target on the ground Namely, rod of the God To carry out kinetic bombardment against the ground Which is capable of causing enormously destructive effects. According to open report In the year 23/20/03, the Air Force of this country enable to put this weapon out of mind Published relevant reports. The purpose of discussing prohibition of weapons in the outer space Is to prevent the comeback of such crazy weapons That will threaten the mankind To be more specific And the definition of a weapons in out space and placement as well as other terminologies. China has the following ideas for your reflection. First in the PPWT draft submitted by China and Russia to the CD The placement of weapons in out space and placement have been clearly defined. The term weapon in outer space means any outer space object or its component produced or converted to eliminate Damage or disrupt normal functioning of objects in outer space, on the Earth's surface, or in the air, as well as to eliminate population components of biosphere important to human existence, or to inflict damage to them by using any principles of physics of A device is considered as placed in out space when it opposes Earth at least once or follows a section of such an orbit. Before leaving this orbit, all is placed at any location in out space or at any celestial bodies other than the Earth. Some delegations Raised the question of the relations between dual use object and weapons That is the dual use problem faced by us in terms of defining weapons. China believes that it can be resolved by developing ex ante standards and ex post standards X ante standards means that If the space object of payload of relevant countries placed in the outer space has the original purpose or design purpose as being used as weapons, Then this space object and payload can be defined as weapons. The exposed standard refers to the following If in accordance with international law: A country is found to have conducted use of force or threat to use of force or carried out armed attack, Then the tool or objects used for such above mentioned acts can be deemed as weapons. Similarly in the penal codes of many countries, there are similar exposed determination standards Whether it is a piece of icicles or a pair of high heels as long as they are used to kill human beings then these can be determined as a weapon for criminal purposes. Mr. Chair. The OEWG should give attention to the definition and explanation of legal terms. The definition and interpretation rather of legal terms for all delegations, While discussing the development of specific code of conduct while discussing norms for specific development, while discussing the development of specific norms for behaviors. We should pay attention to In accordance with lex letter, The interpretation, And definition of a legal Critical legal terms and concepts for space security and arms control legal instruments. In the second-half of this year. The GGE, on further effective measures for the prevention of an arms race in outer space, will start its work. In depth discussion will be carried out on terminologies and other important legal elements. The OEG should take the initiative to carry out preparations And carry out discussions on critical legal terms such as outer space weapons And the legal obligations and legal responsibilities of not deploying weapons in our space By doing so, can we contribute to the conclusion of A legal instrument of arms control in the out space, through discussion, through negotiation rather And this is in line with the mandate of the OEWG. In view of the China recommends the OEWG to appeal to all Member states to observe the following norms, that is The following norm that States shall not place weapons of any kind in out space Including the moon and other celestial bodies. Thank you, Miss Chair.",4
S3M640,3,6,Algeria,"Thank you, Chairman. Of course once our model is pass, This question of the placement of weapons out of space is particularly relevant in view of the fact that our work is endeavouring to find complementarities between Long standing disarmament topics and An approach based on responsible behavior in space. My delegation considers that the degree of complementarity and linkage between these two approaches Will enable us to reach the consensus-based conclusions that we are all hoping to achieve at the end of this groups work With this in mind, balance is key, With a need to reconcile the two approaches. This is important given how it is going to dictate the success or otherwise our group's work chair. Allow me to recall some points of principle with regard to the questions and a discussion. The debate around prevention of an arms racing outer space Is 1, which echoes paragraph 80 of the 10th extraordinary General Assembly session dedicated to disarmament To the effect that new measures need to be taken with the launching of the appropriate international negotiations. In line with the spirit of the Treaty, On the Exploration of Outer Space. With this in mind, my country wishes to express once again its support for efforts to strengthen the legal regime pertaining to outer space, as we endeavour collectively to build a shared future of humanity. My country considers that the Conference of disarmament. The only multilateral negotiating body in the disarmament field Has a first ranking role to play here and should begin Negotiations without further delay on the top picks and its agenda relating to the prevention of an arms race in outer space. My Country stands committed to contributing to efforts to prevent them to raise an outer space, and to participate in the work of the General Assembly Group of Governmental Experts tasked with preparing new effective measures to prevent an arms race in outer space. Algeria attaches particular relevance and importance to preventing such an arms race And this is reflected in our position in favor Of General Assembly resolutions, in this case on the principle of arms race and outer space, as well as the no First placement of weapons in outer space and new specific measures to prevent an arms race in outer space, as well as transparency and confidence building measures concerning space matters, as well as the resolution on the reduction of space threats through norms, Rules and Standards for responsible behaviour. My country Is convinced of the relevance of transparency and company building competence building measures as well as a code of conduct to bolster Mutual trust between states. However, a voluntary code of this type will not on its own be able to fill the existing legal lacunae which do not Enable lethal prevention of an arms race and outer space That would require a legally binding treaty on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Mr. Chairman, We are all in agreement as to the wealth and diversity of initiatives that have been put forward when it comes to prevention of an arms reaching outer space, as well as on responsible space behaviours. From our group, it would be relevant now to look at areas of convergence and explore further possible areas of complementarity between the proposals, in order to come up with a common framework to address the pressing need for proper governance and management of this issue, as we endeavour endeavour to address potentially existential threats whilst bearing in mind the full range of positions that have been expressed by Member States. I thank you, Chair.",4
S3M642,3,6,India,"Thank you. Mr. Chair, my delegation notes that the concerns regarding non-binding norms as well as the subjectivity involved in assessments to be made on the responsibility of space operations that we have been expressing since the first session of this OWG were highlighted again in the discussions this morning regarding the possibility of legally binding provisions being possibly labeled as irresponsible behaviors. We are also encouraged by the acknowledgement by more than one delegation this morning about who and on what basis would assessments be made on the responsibility of space operations. Verification of space behavior using current technology and the access to such technology continues to be a concern. Mr. Chair, India's commitment to the negotiation of a universally acceptable and multilaterally negotiated, legally binding instrument on Paros at the Conference on Disarmament is well known. We are prepared to give consideration to the revised draft Treaty on Prevention of Placement of weapons in outer Space as a contribution to the various proposals for negotiating a legally binding instrument in the CD. Permit me to reiterate in the overall context of the current agenda item, Mr. Chair, that India is opposed to weaponization of the outer space and supports international efforts to reinforce safety and security of space-based assets. Thank you.",4
S3M644,3,6,United Kingdom,"Thank you, Mr.Chair. Mr. Chair, we have heard extensively from Member States about the most pressing threats and challenges they are concerned about. These include, amongst others, deliberate creation of debris threatening the space environment, risks of accidents due to unpredictable manoeuvres and the absence of transparency and communication. Miscalculation and unintended escalation where the intent of states is unclear. For example, when testing counter space capabilities. The deployment of weapons for the specific purpose to destroy satellites. These are urgent issues which require a comprehensive approach and tangible outcomes. This calls for a variety of different instruments and measures, including adherence to the existing legal framework Measures to improve transparency and confidence, including implementation of transparency and confidence building measures already proposed Implementation of existing guidelines, including on the long-term sustainability and debris mitigation guidelines. New non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour and where appropriate, legally binding instruments where these are equitable and verifiable As we have heard so persuasively from many states, these different approaches are not mutually exclusive, nor are they selective and piece meal. Quite the opposite, they are comprehensive and mutually reinforcing Implementation of existing guidelines would significantly improve safety and security. Transparency and confidence building measures can improve the prospects for new norms of behaviour to emerge. New voluntary non-binding norms can reduce risks of misunderstanding, accidents and damage to the space environment. New norms can support the development of new, legally binding instruments, as was the case with the Outer Space Treaty. With this in mind, we would strongly disagree with what we understood to be the premise of the intervention earlier today from the Russian delegation that voluntary and non-binding measures are unnecessary and counterproductive and might undermine the existing legal framework. Our discussions so far in this open-ended working group demonstrate that the opposite is true Voluntary norms can build on and complement the existing legal framework, and may also point the way to eventual legally binding instruments. From that perspective, we agree in principle that certain outcomes of this open-ended working group could inform later discussions within the UN on legally binding instruments, for example in the forthcoming Group of Governmental Experts. Mr. Chair, when it comes to the PPWT, there are significant practical difficulties As others have noted, many capabilities in the space domain are inherently dual use or dual purpose, making it difficult to define a weapon in space and posing challenges for verification and attribution. As a consequence, prohibiting specific types of objects in outer space does not effectively solve the security problem. It is the behaviours of states with respect to these capabilities that may give rise to concerns, and that's why we suggest focusing on norms, rules and principles responsible behaviours. Regarding a proposed ban on the threat or use of force against space objects existing, international law already prohibits the threat or use of force against any state, and Article Three of the Outer Space Treaty provides that states shall carry on their activities in outer space in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter. That concludes our remarks. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M646,3,6,Switzerland,"Merci, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With regard to topic four, we would like to make the following remarks. We consider that the question of placement of weapons in outer space is important and relevant. Albeit one element only of the response to strengthening space security in view of the large number of space systems and the dual potential use thereof, we have already expressed out our opinion on this subject with regard to our topic two and I do not intend to reiterate those points now. I will therefore be brief. Switzerland Is concerned at the possible placement in outer space of weapons With targets on Earth or intended to intercept missiles, bearing in mind that such systems are ideal targets and could precipitate conflict in space. Moreover, we are also concerned at the fact that space systems could be equipped with anti-satellite weapons of whatever kind and once again they could contribute to precipitating conflict in space. Consequently, we consider. Therefore, that the placement of any weapons system in outer space is not to be considered a responsible behaviour. However, we would recall the prohibition on the placement of nuclear weapons or other WMDS in outer space as set forth in Article Four, one of the Outer Space Treaty. I thank you.",4
S3M648,3,6,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Setting aside questions I have about the reasons why Russia's space troops are building and testing a Ground Launched Anti Satellite Missile, and setting aside questions I have about Russia's use of outer space to pursue its invasion of Ukraine. I'd like to provide some remarks which I think my Russian colleague will not be surprised about, about several difficulties that the United States sees at this time in both defining and verifying whether a weapon has been placed in space. The United States does not believe that it would be possible for a country to determine whether an object was specifically designed or ratified for harm or damage to other outer space objects, Drafting A treaty requires the use of precise language to avoid ambiguity that could lead to problems in implementation. We have already had a significant conversation about dual use systems today, which could be impacted by definitions if we are not careful. Moreover, many countries attempted to conceal their activities that may be counter to those obligations And in that regard, the United States sees verification as an incredibly difficult challenge related to determining whether weapons have been placed in outer space That is why we are supporting developing common understandings now around activities that can arise that could be considered threatening or lead to miscalculations And using the development of norms of responsible behavior to move quickly to address these threats, such as we did last year with our commitment regarding destructive direct descent anti-satellite missile testing. Thank you.",0
S3M650,3,6,Austria,"Mr. Chair, on this specific topic we would like to refer to our intervention on space to space threats and the problems we see through the appearance, development, testing and use of such capabilities. We also note again that many working papers have addressed this issue and asked for norms in this field. An arm against the deployment, testing or use of all kinds of counter space capabilities which could also be considered as weapons, or more or less they are but also the responsible behavior with other capabilities in outer space and a strong commitment by many stakeholders in this regard could be one of the main outcomes of our work. This is fully in line with the work on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and the overall aim of the creation of a legally banning instrument. It is regarding other forum which we have to note are less inclusive than this one. I thank you.",4
S3M652,3,6,New Zealand,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to briefly lend our voice to those states who have raised the challenges and difficulties associated with an approach focused on the prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space. While El Toro and New Zealand does not rule out new legally binding mechanisms relating to the security of space activities in the future, the proposed approach does little to address the current space security context. Many delegations have spoken this week to the importance of reducing misperceptions, misunderstanding and escalation in space. A legally binding instrument focused on the placement of weapons in outer space does not address these important concerns. Additionally, such an approach faces challenges in identifying or defining weaponry in the space context, and in providing for verification of adherence to any such instrument. Finally, a prohibition against the placement of weapons in space does not address the threat of Earth to space weapons, which arguably represent the most pressing threat to space systems today A Responsible Behaviours approach better addresses these concerns And such an approach will reduce space threats today and could help to inform the development of illegally abiding instruments in the future. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M654,3,6,Russia,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to make some remarks In connection With this topic and what we have heard The topic of the placements of weapons in outer space. Firstly, I would like to state with regard To the pertaining context As it relates to space and the context of space activity, the following we appreciate that certain delegations may consider The primary challenge requiring Resolution To be in one form, other delegations may have different priorities. This is understandable and normal, but it does not mean That the issues of interest in one or the other do not exist, and we stand ready to continue to reaffirm that for us and for the majority of UN Member States Supporting the relevant Resolution of the General Assembly non first placement as well as the resolution on Paras. The resolution on further practical measures To prevent an arms race in outer space and also the resolution adopted by consensus Concerning Transparency and confidence building measures in space activities Recognize the threat of the placement of weapons in outer space as a threat as such And consequently, as a topic of first ranking importance, requiring discussion and resolution by all Member States in an endeavour to prevent an arms race in outer space from emerging. Therefore, I have discussed this issue and the threat. This was done at the last OWG. It is one of the most pressing threats that requires review and resolution in this forum Including and above all, in the context of the adoption of potential norms for its removal and resolution as a threat. We would like to underscore That in view of the remit and mandate of this group. There is to be no talk, nor should there be drafting of legally binding instruments in this forum. This group does not have the power to do so. It's not mandated to do so. It is intended to provide recommendations on the reduction of space-based threats through the potential drafting of certain legal norms or principles. This is something that we have talked about. They need to adopt recommendations within the working group, With a view to preventing the placement of weapons in outer space. In view of the need for the appropriate standards to this end, which would prohibit the placement of weapons in space. This is what we are here to do, the placement of weapons in space, if you will Is in our view The most irresponsible form of behavior in space. It poses a direct threat to international peace and security, and this is something which is recognised not only by the Russian Federation but by virtually all of the international community. With a few rare exceptions, I would like to also comment On the points made about the fact that the PPWT does not address the issue of Earth to space threat as mentioned by New Zealand. This is not something which is mentioned as a threat in the proposal when it comes to the risk of earth to outer space vector. That is something which would fall under other working segments of this group and Might come under the next segment on the Prevention of use of force or threat of use of force. Also, within anti space capability. We feel that our position was made really quite clear As to the possible norms that would be needed in order to remove the threat posed by the Earth outer space vector. But our ultimate proposal is to address and do away with all threats and this includes tests of certain forms of weapon that might have anti space capability. We also make reference to a ban on the implementation of such systems, the elaboration of such systems, the manufacturing of such systems And also the elimination of all such systems that may already have been elaborated and exist today. What more could the Russian Federation propose? What more is there to say on this? Therefore, let us adopt further recommendations. We're not, we're not opposed to that. Now with regard to TCMS in terms of space activity and the adoption of new norms here we would like clearly to underscore our position. Maybe we were not entirely clear in doing so. Maybe it was not appropriate Rendered into the other languages, but we did say that voluntary norms in and of themselves are counterproductive in terms of space security. We never have said as such. We have always said that certain standards Can be of a supportive character in terms of preventing arms race in outer space, but Resolving the challenges of space security purely purely on the basis of such voluntary norms, Particularly when it comes to resolving the issue of the alarms raised in outer space in the absence of the legally binding standards, holds no prospects. Since voluntary norms, however wonderful they are, cannot guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space or the use of force in outer space. Since they there is no obligatory compliance, they're voluntary by nature And being voluntary, there is no mandatory verification, Such voluntary standards are not binding in terms of information supply And there is no obligation carried by such stones. For verification in view of their voluntary nature only. Only binding standards are able to provide an effective regime to ensure the prevention of an unrest in outer space and security in outer space. It is only they that will carry mandatory compliance and will have in place a mandatory verification mechanism. Particularly bearing in mind the well-known examples that exist of arms control. Where there are either only non-binding nonsense principles in place Or legally binding principles with the certain. Verification measures in place Which work well. That it is where there is no binding character involved that the problems arise in our View. We feel therefore that there is no point going down that path and just doing the work that's been done once again. Once again, let me repeat that we consider that voluntary norms, transparency building, measured component building measures Are supporting measures which can of course make a contribution to building outer space security, but they are not enough on their own in order to resolve Issues pertaining to ensuring this security And considering only such voluntary measures As a way of removing a trace threat will not yield the desired result without legally binding norms. They cannot substitute legally binding norms. As regards standard arguments around defining space weapons, in the absence of a verification regime, we would like to state the following. These problems and these arguments Are Well, they look somewhat strange from the viewpoint of Political commitments or binding commitments, binding commitments, no need verification Or rather, non-binding don't need verification because they're not mandatory. They could be created, but they do not need to be created. But they don't. They're not. Such a regime is not needed to shore them up from the from square one, but we're not against that. Sometimes it's been introduced, and it's been in demand. But such norms can be developed In that linkage, why not? The same thing concerns definitions. With respect to various terms related to Mandatory political commitments, but also legally binding commitments. There are many examples of legally binding agreements where the very scope of those agreements is not defined at all within the regimes. This includes arms control And this does not hinder the effective implementation of the regime and did not hinder the adoption of such agreements. Also, as regards definitions, well we have many issues which have been submitted for consideration by this very OWG where the scope of the issues is not defined. More than that, no definition has even been posited. For example of space, potential space capabilities, what is the definition? There is no such definition. What is dual use systems? This has not been defined. There is equally no definition, for example, Of a topic which we will be discussing in the very near future Systems That need certain protections. None of this is defined. However, that does not hinder our discussion. Moreover A number of states who have offered criticism of non placement of weapons in station just because they are satisfied with the existing definitions of weapons in space proposed discussing the topics which I mentioned and no problems arise here And one last comment As a response to the words that were voiced. The behaviourist concept Enters into a conflict with the concept Proposed with respect to the prevention of the placement of weapons in space, we reiterate our position. We see no contradiction between these no these two concepts. Moreover, as we have said, these two concepts can coexist In the same legal environment, they are compatible, mutually compatible. If we're talking about preventing the placement of weapons in space, we're only talking about systems and devices that Are from the very square one weapons that is designed for causing damage to or destroying any kind of space objects or devices. The definition is being read out twice today. I think anyone can look it up As for all the rest, what we have heard is a strictly behaviourist approach and the prevention of the use of force or the threat of use of force Against space objects or using space objects is where we will discuss that it is a strictly behaviourist approach, but as regards The prevention of placement of weapons in space. There should be a ban on the placement of weapons in space And there is a behaviourist component there. That is a ban. It is a ban on a certain behaviour. That behaviour is the placement of weapons in space. Placement of weapons in space is one of the behaviours. If you prefer this language, that should be banned in our opinion. Thank you.",4
S3M656,3,6,Brazil,"In line with our long standing support for the objective of the negotiation of a treaty on the prevention of an Arms race and outer space, Brazil has welcomed the updated draft submitted jointly by the Russian Federation and China on the prevention of placement of weapons in outer Space, the Threat of Use of Force against Outer Space objects, the PPWT. We believed that the initiative was a constructive contribution to the work of the conference at the time, and we deemed it as a good basis for discussions toward adoption adopting an international binding instrument on pairs. However, We also recall that the initiative has not prospered under the CD, due in particular to the concerns of many states, with challenges associated with the definition of weapons in outer space and with the obstacles to verification of compliance. It would be ideal, Mr. Chairman, if we could start the negotiation of norms and a legally binding instrument that would address the concerns around weaponization of space. Nonetheless, it is also important to recognize that the subject has many aspects and that solution to specific issues regarding the prevention of an arms race in outer space should also address threats associated with behaviour. We believe that there is no inherent opposition between a focus on capabilities and a focus on behavior. Other disarmament and non-proliferation treaties often focus on both to solve the dual use dilemma that we now face here. The Chemical Weapons Convention, for example, defines chemical weapons as munitions or devices specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of toxic chemicals. The definition includes, however, a generic alternative that classifieds toxic chemicals as weapons if they are used as such, in other words, for purposes prohibited under the convention. Therefore, it addresses both capabilities and behavior, both design and actual use. This OWG offers a new framing for the discussion on space security that needs not be at odds with past initiatives and possible convergences on this topic. We need to be creative and forward-looking, and we stand ready to explore possible solutions to this conundrum. We cannot afford inaction on this matter. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M658,3,6,France,"short something about I just have one point to make on transparency and coveting building measures. We don't want to extend the debate unnecessarily. The last statement from our Russian colleague for me was a little bit difficult to understand. He started to say that the implementation of Norms for Responsible Behaviour and the implementation of TCBMS. Conspiracy and confidence ability measures could be counterproductive. Then if I understood correctly He indicated that an approach uniquely based on such norms and measures cannot Ensure Space security? He didn't say the opposite. We didn't hear that A norms-based approach is substituted by developing of legally binding documents. Which would be possible documents regulating certain practices? So a norm based approach is practical, it's not a substitute. For envisages no legally binding instruments I would like to go back over what was heard, which is to say that when an instrument is legally binding, legally binding, it cannot be violated. However, we see every day that legally binding instruments, for example the UN Charter, can be violated. This happens and so that argument here also is null and void. We could expect to see more reluctance by some delegations to discuss TCBMS And we find ourself talking about this and not about the non-first placement of weapons in space. If we had followed the chairpersons indicative timetable, we'll be discussing that. But we're concerned to see that some delegations declined to talk about what we've agreed unanimously to discuss in line with the last General Assembly resolution on transparency and confidence building measures in space Which must lead to a new report at the end of this year in these conditions. As a part of this group, we would like now to move forward and discuss TCBMS to meet the needs expressed by a growing number of states in the room. To fulfill that mandate. Thank you.",2
S3M660,3,6,Germany,"Thank you. I would like also to make two comments on what the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation has stated and can continue in the same spirit. As my French colleague already started, First of all, It is true that nobody, probably in this group and in this room, intends to substitute. The existing legally binding framework with voluntary non-binding norms. That can be interpreted and implemented by the parties at their full discretion, discretion. This is simply not true. This is not the mandate of this group and that that is, this is not what we are talking about here. What we are talk about actually is the concept of voluntary. Legally binding norms and rules of responsible behaviors, and this concept means what it basically says These rules are binding by the very nature. They might be not legally binding, but they are binding politically and need to be respected Their content and their implementation thus are not discretionary. They shall adhere to and they should be respected at any time, So in this sense we consider that Voluntary, non-legally binding norms. They are neither non-binding nor we believe that they are depending on Current circumstances that can change from one moment to the other. In the contrary, As legally binding norms, non-legally binding norms, they should also prove their effectiveness, particularly then when things are not going the right way And then, When it comes to times of crisis A norm that does not work under stress, be it politically binding or legally binding, is simply not fit for purpose. So, we do not see such a huge Difference between these two types of norms. At the same time, it is also clear to us that the effective implementation of a non-legally binding voluntary norm requires a minimum level of trust and at least the political will for cooperation and to understand the other party. But as my French colleague already said, in case of absence of this minimal level of trust And cooperation, also legally binding norms will arguably not function as the universal remedy they are sometimes displayed here. And that is exactly the reasons why we work together in this OWG. For changing views on these topics and for trying to develop elements of common understanding and to develop this minimum level of trust that is anyway needed. Thank you.",2
S3M662,3,6,China,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just now, the US colleague. Regarding, The lack of possibility of determining whether and placement of weapons are made in the outer space Made some comments. They said it is impossible to determine whether a country has already placed weapons in outer space. My understanding is that he referred to the issue of verification China understands their concerns. Regarding verification In reality, the US has Mentioned the verification issues in outer space a long time ago. Please allow me to read something in English now. Thank you. In 1960s President Eisenhower, When he addressed to the General Assembly on 22nd September 1960 And in his address. He said and Quote We agree Subject to appropriate verification that no nation will put into orbit or station in outer space weapons of mass destruction. He also said that all launchings of spacecraft should be verified in advance by the United Nations. It means that, you know, in 1960s the US leader was considering the verification issue. However, after seven years, The international community Agreed on the Space Treaty in 1967 The fact is that except the requirements of verification. The US underlying principles were all incorporated in the treaty. What that means that, Verification. Our verification clause is not necessarily included in the Treaty From the history we can see that In the space treated was concluded without verification Clause Yeah, now I continue in Chinese. Yes, in Chinese. What I meant to say was that. What I meant to say was that Verification clause Is not entirely indispensable. The Outer Space Treaty does not contain a verification clause. The PW. Neither does the PwC BWC, sorry. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the US delegate could think again on the issue of verification. Maybe with the progress of the technologies, we might reach the states where we could verify. However, Even without a verification clause, we can still conclude a treaty. The OST has was concluded in this way in 1967. The President as and how well mentioned this clause, But eventually the US was still agreed with the lack of verification clause in the treaty. This is my understanding of the clause of verification. I would also like to touch upon BWT, I'm sorry, PWT. Some colleagues have voiced their support to PWT. What I want to stress is that The PPWT. Does not only belong to China or Russia Because Some countries when they hear the name of PPWT, they would label it as a proposal from China or Russia or belongs to China or Russia. In reality The draft belongs to the entire international community As it is the only draft treaty on the table. We do hope that everybody Can treat this draft treaty with an objective attitude Should you have any questions, we are very much willing to discuss with you or dialogue having dialogue with you. Finally, there is a technical issue. Just now When I took the floor on IHL. My colleague reminded me that maybe there's one sentence that was not fully interpreted accurately. Therefore, I would like to stress once again on this sentence, The sentence should be China is not in any way against The humanitarian. Chinese also keeping friendly Discussions with ICRC and ICRC's colleagues. Thank you very much, Mr. President.",2
S3M664,3,6,Russia,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairperson. We would like to respond to what was stated by a number of different delegations, including directly. In reference to our own country, First of all, we would like to be clear about our statement about the lack of perspectives Or prospects for considering Confidence building measures. In the context of resolving issues around the peaceful use of space and maintaining the safety of space activities Without Unreliable guarantees of keeping space free of the placement of weapons Reinforced. In legally binding documents, instruments on preventing an arms race in outer space. The lack of perspectives or prospects is In connection with the following. That such norms themselves Cannot Eliminate the threats that exist with respect to outer space. If they will not be shored up with reliable guarantees with respect to the prevention of an arms race in outer space. With respect to maintaining space, safety or security And the reason for this is simple, and this is what other delegations have spoken about, and we consider this to be an extremely critical conversation with respect to the difference between legally binding And non-binding politically binding commitments, rules or obligations, whatever language you prefer. I think that for any lawyer this is something which is completely self-evident. What is the difference between Such norms? The main difference between such norms Is that legally binding norms Stipulate specific mechanisms And procedures of liability or responsibility for the implementation of such norms Which In turn, are not stipulated by political commitments That is to say that if any party does not comply with politically binding commitments or norms. No one will engage their international liability or responsibility. Moreover, there is no provision with respect to political commitments of any international mechanisms or regimes. Which in turn is stipulated for legally binding norms And This is why Even at the national level, various procedures are provided for approving such norms. If, with respect to legally binding norms, there are procedures such as ratification That is a parliament of a country approving and adopting such norms. The Parliament representing the national population or other national procedures for ratification then, in respect to political commitments, none of that is required. I think that the difference between the status of these two different types of norms is clear and understood and without any doubt both types of norms should be respected and complied with. But as was stated correctly, I think it was the delegate from Austria. Even legally binding norms Are sometimes violated, Leaving alone political commitments. Where no international liability is stipulated and there is no ratification even by the given states, so there is not even the documented foundation for responsibility. Moreover, as we already said, politically binding norms Are not provided for at all. What about mechanisms for liability or responsibility? These are not either provided for No verification mechanisms are established. In the vast majority also, there's no Definitions of the very scope of political commitments, a great deal else is also lacking But legally binding norms. In part, incorporate political commitments into themselves, into alia, for example, the TCBMS which have been mentioned so much today Usually A regular part of legally binding instruments themselves. The majority of legally binding treaties or agreements have a separate set of provisions on transparency and confidence building measures. Moreover, as I already said the converse or opposite logic is not true political commitments. Do not list elements from mandatory, legally binding agreements or treaties. And this is the very nature of the problem In the politically binding norms Cannot 100% Eradicate or eliminate space threats Or ensure reliable guarantees That space activities Will be executed without Harm or prejudice to international peace and security Moving on to trust The trust or confidence that many delegations have mentioned. We remember Very well the phrase expressed by the US President Trust but verify In our opinion, this reflects As well as anything else, the reality that we are faced with Without any doubt Confidence building measures are needed, but, as was stated by the Austrian and German delegations. We can sometimes see a major trust deficit and in that case, confidence building measures are not alone enough All the more so because many politically political commitments and TCBMS. Well, the very countries that advocate for them so much and speak so much about them Themselves do not comply with them or even violate their own TCBMS. In such a world, We can only place our hopes in legally binding norms. Thank you.",2
S3M666,3,6,United States,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very briefly, I just wanted to point out Article 12 of the Outer Space Treaty says all stations, installations, equipment And space vehicles on the moon and other celestial bodies shall be open to representatives of other state parties to the treaty on a basis of reciprocity. This is a verification provision. I personally look forward to someday conducting an inspection on the moon. Thank you.",2
S3M72,3,7,Russia,"By Shiva. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Before moving to discussion of this topic. We would like to return briefly to yesterday's discussion, Which in our view Is of quite significant interest to the group in particular One of the topics we touched upon Was that Of demilitarization Partial demarcation of outer space. We heard certain assessments In this connection in particular. We made reference to the Antarctic Treaty. Article 1 thereof We heard certain comments from our colleague from Canada. Yesterday,  Work was undertaken on this In order to ultimately be able to get a handle on this topic And in that connection, I would like to draw our Canadian colleagues attention. To the comments on International Space law. The Cologne Which are doctrinally authoritative in terms of source. In this connection, They are a source of interpretation Of the Outer Space Treaty And in particular, attention is to be drawn to paragraph 46 there of Which directly draws on Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty. I would like to quote that paragraph, Which is as follows Or else, The phrase only for peaceful purposes Used in the Antarctic Treaty text Is generally understood As full demilitarization of the Antarctic, this wording in from the first sentence. The essence of this sentence, The similarity of this sentence. With the 1st Sentence of the paragraph two of Article four of the of the Outer Space Treaty As well as the fact that Article 4 Was elaborated In light of the Antarctic Treaty Attests to the intention of the authors of the Treaty To ensure the demilitarization of the moon And other celestial bodies. Through the inclusion of paragraph two of Article 4, In our view This paragraph 46 Provides full clarity From a legal point of view, With regard to Article 4, paragraph 2 And specifically with regard to the question of full demilitarization Of the significant portion of outer space, the moon, and other celestial bodies. Therefore in our view, Discussion of this issue And attempt to somehow interpret this text in this connection is counterproductive And makes little sense in our view. Thank you for your attention.",2
S3M74,3,7,Canada,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, everyone. I'll just be brief. Thank you very much for quoting the Cologne commentary. I'm familiar with it. We all got it at copious. I have read that passage. There's also numerous other academic interpretations of that. But the significant difference I would point out, and then we can, I think we should probably move on after that, is that in the Antarctic Treaty, there's actually an additional provision which says which includes a prohibition on any measures of a military nature. That sentence ended up being absent from the text of the Outer Space Treaty. Resulting in some academic debate as to what exactly the Scope of the Outer Space Treaty was visa vie the Antarctic Treaty. It's a detail, it's a great academic discussion that we could have some other time, but probably not one for here and we could probably move on. So thank you very much to my Russian colleagues for raising that. I enjoy a nice academic debate and I think it's a good time now to move on to the next topic. Thank you very much.",2
S3M76,3,7,Russia,"By Shiba. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Once again, as the initiative of this topic and its inclusion as a separate topic in the timetable, the indicative timetable that you proposed, Sir. We would like to present our approach to the question connected to the possible elaboration of norms, rules and principles in connection with the prevention of the use of force or threat of use of force Against space object. It is our view that consideration of possible political norms, rules and principles with a view to ensuring space security Is not a goal in itself but serves Purely as an intermediate step as part of work to resolve the challenge of preventing an arms racing outer space. As we have already indicated And we provided quite an extensive explanation of this yesterday. In the absence of reliable guarantees of preservation of outer space as a place free from weapons. As enshrined in an international legally binding treaty on Paris, Which would also include a ban on the use of force or threat of use of force against space objects or with space objects. The resolution of matters in connection with the peaceful use of space and guarantees of security of space activity Are without perspectives. Since, 100% guarantee of this is connected with normal space activity in the full security thereof. This would not be possible unless such conditions were met As part of the discussion of topic 5, We would once again like to draw delegations attention to the Russia China draft PPWT on prevention, on arms racing outer space And the use of force or threat of use of force against space object, Which reflects the challenge of preventing the use of force or threat of use of force against space objects, Particularly A provision of this draft is a proposed ban on such acts, Moreover, It is absolutely clear what is to be understood by such acts. Yesterday we also addressed this matter and we stand ready to repeat, That the suggestion of force or use of force. It's taken, it's taken to be understood as any harmful act against space object Including Aimed at their destruction Damage Temporary or permanent interference or violation with normal functioning Deliberate change in orbit parameters Or a threat of undertaking such acts, Under this definition. Falls the use of force or threat of use of force and against space objects and also using such space objects. I should also like to recall our corresponding proposals, as set out in a series of Russian working papers Which, We have made available including the first and second sessions of this working group. Into alia. These proposals relate to what is being discussed under topic 5. A Search norms for the regulation of active states in outer space Against the backdrop of preventing the use of force or threat of use of force against based objects or using space objects Could, in our view, be as follows in terms of obligations which should be assumed by UN Member States. These are as follows, not to use space objects as weapons with any target on Earth, in the air, or in outer space Not to elaborate, not to test, not to deploy, and not to use Space weapons For anti-missile defense. As an anti-satellite system, for use against any target on earth or in the air Not to destroy, not to harm, Not to interfere with the normal functioning and not to change the flight trajectory of space objects of other states Not provide assistance Nor to provide promotion to states or other groups of states International, intergovernmental or any other non-governmental organisations. Including non-governmental legal persons. Established, Registered Or located on the territory Under their jurisdiction And or control To participation in any of the aforementioned acts The combination Of the proposals that we had on the topic four with regard to prevention of placement of weapons in outer space And The proposals as to Not elaborating and not testing And not deploying weapons in space For Any goal, Including anti-missile defense, As well as anti-satellite systems Or use against targets on Earth or in the air, As well as the proposal to take on an obligation to destroy existence that may already be possessed by states. The fact that these norms apply both to topic four and five, in our view. Would, if combined, allow for genuine space security, allowing us to prevent space from becoming a beachhead progression and war And a forum for armed conflicts, Whilst ensuring that it would be possible to prevent an arms race in outer space. Of course, this is an ambitious task, Which will require political will from UN member states With a sense of responsibility and accountability for the fate and future of the world, and ultimately. It will contribute to supporting and ensuring security, well, security Any piece meal or arbitrary meshes As we have already underscored Would be counterproductive and destructive against the backdrop of attempts to ensure International Security and strategic stability. Rather than helping to strengthen Such situations Declared declarative statements Need therefore to strictly To Be bear in mind the task at hand and not to any political end Would be aimed at achieving political And political advantage. Whilst failing to in fact resolve the tasks that face us In the worst case, such piece meal measures Would give an advantage to certain states or a group of states. With a degree of discrimination Or with the creation of a threat in terms of security for other states, Leading to potential degradation of the stability situation in terms of security worldwide Strategic stability Rather than strengthening that stability And would lead simply To further escalation of destabilisation in the global situation With this escalation potentially also spreading to space. As we have frequently stated, we consider Certain signals and concrete acts Which would appear to indicate that that is indeed the case in terms of a trend. We consider that to be highly dangerous and undesirable as a tendency Moreover, in connection with some initiative being actively promoted by certain western states to which not to undertake destructive anti-satellite testing, we should note That's such a proposal, It really is one of those examples of a selective arbitrary measure. As I touched upon a moment ago A ban on such testing Is quite clearly aimed purely at achieving political advantage And serves merely political declaratory ends for the initiators. Since, Such states have already done this set a long time ago. They don't need any more tests. As such at the same time, Those states who have not undertaken such states who do not possess such capabilities, unlike the initiators of that initiative, will face serious hindrances In terms Of Putting in place the systems to prevent replacement weapons insist in space Or to prevent the malicious use of space objects. Accordingly, We face a fairly standard situation in terms of strategic security where one Has everything. I have sword and shield In terms of strategic security And is trying to prevent others from having the shield also, From our side, it is our view that all states should assume comprehensive obligations. As I set out, that would include A full refusal to place weapons in space and Use of force and threat of force in connection with space objects or using space objects, With regard to capabilities on Earth And space based. Moreover, we propose the elimination of infrastructure that already exists and which might have been intended for those purposes. In order to ensure That the obligations taken on by states. Do not have any possibility in the future for such systems to be further prepared in the future, In order, once and for all to guarantee That space can be preserved For strictly peaceful purposes, for use and exploration for peaceful purposes. Thank you for your attention.",4
S3M78,3,7,Korea,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be brief. As a matter of principle, international law, including Article 4, Article 2, paragraph four of the UN Charter, as well as Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty on the prohibition of use of force or the threat of use of force, applies to the applies to the outer space. Specifically, Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty gives examples of prohibited behavior, such as the establishment of military bases and installation of nuclear weapons and other kinds of WMD. Apart from this, and in order to improve space security, my delegation underscores the importance of reaching to uncommon understanding among states on further irresponsible behaviors that state should refrain from For instance, using kinetic or non-kinetic capabilities to damage or permanently destruct other countries, space, object or assets could be considered as prohibited use of force.",4
S3M711,3,7,Pakistan,"Thank you, Chair. Under this topic, as has been highlighted by several delegates throughout this week, that there is of course UN under UN Charter clear prohibition of refraining from threat to use of force in international relations. And it has been highlighted of course about this provision in Outer space Treaty under Article 3 which governs that all outer space activities will be regulated. Under international law, including the UN Charter. So when we talk about threat or use of force, we are not talking about imposing any new prohibition or any evolving a new norm. Of course it is there, but for my delegation we have always highlighted that this needs to be, this commitment needs to be reaffirmed and the context in which through this, at this time when this OEWG is meeting, its important. We have seen growing mistrust. Between states, we have seen increasing weaponization. In outer space, we have seen different destabilizing tents that my delegation and several other delegations have highlighted throughout the course and in earlier meetings of OEWG as well. That is why we strongly believe that this prohibition on threat to use of force in outer space activities, it needs to be brought out. It needs to be.",4
S3M713,3,7,China,"Thank you, Thank you, Mr. Chair. China is of the view that Norms, rules and principles related to the prevention of use of force or threat of use of force with regard to space objects or with their use, are not only required for the application of international law in our space activities, but also serve as an important reference for the interpretation of key legal terms. The paragraph four of Article two of the UN Charter clearly stipulates that all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat of use of force against the territorial integrity of political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations. The Article 3 of OST points out that State parties to the Treaty shall carry on activities in the exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, in accordance with international law, including the charter of the UN, in the interests of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding And the UN Charter should be applied to the outer space in the agreement governing the activities of states on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Article 3, Paragraph 2 stipulates that any threat or use of force or any other hostile acts or threat of hostile acts on the moon is prohibited. Countries while carrying out space activities should observe the above-mentioned principle and refrain from use or threat of use of force against space object under the jurisdiction of other countries. Particularly in the current situation where some countries establish space forces and space commands one after another and the military buildup and expansion in our space intensifies, the implementation of the above mentioned legal provisions is of great significance in preventing space from becoming a battlefield. Yesterday, some colleagues pointed out that In the UN Charter Use A threat of Use force principle has been stipulated, therefore there is no need to have. A negotiation so as to conclude a treaty China begs to differ In the UN Charter, there is only a basic principle. However, the environment and object in the space, as well as their behaviors are unique There are still legal ambiguities. For example, How do we define the threshold of using force against the space object, How do we understand the right of self-defense of countries in the space, When a commercial entity of 1 country conducts hostile activities or in the space. The country which the entity falls into its jurisdiction, What kind of legal responsibilities should this country shoulder, Therefore, it's necessary to negotiate a legal instrument And all kind of scenarios Of use of force in our space, exceptional clause, legal responsibilities and settlement of disputes. We need to develop specific provisions. This in itself can be understood as an explanation of the application of specific provisions of the UN Charter applicability in the space. The OEWG's discussion on this issue is a useful complement to the existing international law on space, and it will provide support for our future conclusion of a legal instrument through negotiation. The key in the formulation of norms, rules and principles related to the prevention of use of force or threat of use of force with regards to space objects lies in accurate interpretation of existing rules in international law, States should work hard To reach a common understanding. Legal terms such as use of force, armed attack, hostile activities, amongst others. China knows that During the previous two sessions On the concept of use of force and armed attack, some discussions were carried out, yet relevant discussion is still at a preliminary stage. Countries have already fully understand the importance and. Complexity in reaching consensus on the interpretation of key legal terms. If states lack consensus on the understanding of key legal terms And lack understanding of each other's legal positions and views And do not have clear rules in relation to space. The risk of misperception and miscalculation in space will be much higher and even give rise to armed conflicts in space. In view of the above, China recommends the OEWG to appeal to the states to follow the following norms first. Not resort to the threat or use of force against the outer space objects of state parties, Except exercising. Sorry, second, Do not carry out hostile activities or threat by hostile activities on the moon or other celestial bodies in the space. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M715,3,7,Cuba,"Thank you very much Chair and good morning. My delegation would like to use this opportunity, since we're discussing this subject, that the possibility of use of force or threat of use of force is contrary to our collective commitment and the UN Charter. With a focus on the goal of a peaceful use of outer space, We have to comply with the sacred principle enshrined in Article Two of the UN Charter not to use Ford, and this also includes activities in outer space for my delegation. This provision of the uncharted is a basic norm of current international law and it regulates peaceful relations between states. This is a peremptory norm of international law And its consideration in the context of outer space is indeed something that is clear. My delegation has heard what the distinguished representative of Pakistan said. We have to focus on the Issue of use of threat force in outer space as we work towards legally binding instrument that prohibits the use of Fort in outer space. Would like to express our concern with the use of space technologies to the detriment of The international community and the use of such technologies with that run counter the objectives of the peaceful use of outer space. Thank you.",4
S3M717,3,7,Switzerland,"Mercy, Mr. Thank you very much, Chair. The question of the use of force, or threat of the use of force in outer space is a fundamental issue in our work, and we have already made a relevant statement on that issue when we were discussing Theme one, We believe that that statement is something that is very irrelevant on this current issue. I'll just recall some important points. We recall that the UN Charter applies to outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies. This especially relates to the prohibition of the threat or the use of force, reflected in Article 2, paragraph four of the UN Charter. The threat or a use of force by state against space systems of another country is illegal. As far as the right legitimate defense is concerned, as enshrined in Article 51 of the Uncharted, if applicable, we have to say that it cannot be employed in outer space unless it's done in a very restrictive manner. Especially, it can in no way represent any reprisal actions in outer space Or any so-called preventive act of legitimate defense In addition, the exercise of that right is limited by Numerous principles that are part of International Space law and we refer you to our statement that we made during the discussion of Theme One. Thank you.",4
S3M719,3,7,Algeria,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Undoubtedly, respecting the UN Charter is a mainstay of our efforts to consecrate the peaceful research on outer space, therefore, The rule Of The prohibition of the use of force or the threat there of an outer space remains A main rule that should, that should, there should be no question about we have always confirmed that the international law applies to outer space activities as a general rule. Also, we have to admit that there needs to be more binding rules Or to become a binding framework That responds to the special nature of space and the rapid development Related thereto.",4
S3M721,3,7,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to speak on topic 5 norms, rules and principles related to the use of force or threat or use of force with regard to space objects or with their use. The United States does not agree with any suggestion that there is a gap in existing legally binding agreements that needs to be filled by a new treaty based ban on the use of force or threat of use of force in outer space Existing legal obligations on the use of force Including paragraph four of Article 2 and 51 of the United Nations Charter and customary international law obligations currently and adequately address this issue.",4
S3M723,3,7,Philippines,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. My intervention will address both topics four and five. The Philippines views outer space not only as a global common, but as a province of all humankind. All nations have the right to the peaceful uses of outer space, but this right must be exercised with due regard to the right and interest of others and to the preservation of outer space for future generations. Spacefaring nations are mere stewards for future generations. In this regard, preserving outer space requires that we secure it and keep it free from weapons and from weaponization. The Philippines remains driven by our aspiration for legally binding instruments on preventing an arms race in outer space, including the prevention of placement of weapons and the threat or use of force against space object. We hope that this OEWG will find merit in reaffirming these aspirations. In its final report, we fully agree with the previous delegation that spoke regarding the already existing prohibition on the use of force under customary international law And the United Nations Charter, the OE WG has no authority to alter or revise this legally binding prohibition. Still, nothing stops this OEWG from reaffirming this as a fact and from recognizing that the pursuit of further legally binding measures in this regard is useful. We must continue to work for our aspiration for legally binding instruments on Paris. We should ensure that such work would address concerns regarding definitions and verification in. In particular, the Philippines believes that negotiation of such binding instruments should uphold fully the peaceful uses of outer space and should not hamper innovation. In addition, concerns relating to the precise definition of the use of force as the in the context of outer space, as well as the right to self-defense, must likewise be considered. But these conversations are best facilitated elsewhere, including in relevant disarmament bodies that are competent in the context of negotiating such instruments. Finally, discussions on outer space security need to transcend the traditional strategic paradigm. The security of outer space is no longer about maintaining strategic parity among major space faring powers. It is about securing outer space for the peaceful uses of all nations, including developing countries and including all generations. We are concerned about the security doctrines that classify outer space as a strategic or warfighting domain. We see risk in insufficient understanding of the purpose and use of certain space assets and technologies, and of mutual threat perceptions, the lack of channels of communication, and of transparency on national space programs, policies, strategies and doctrines And the absence of clear and internationally understood standards and norms of behavior. We see work to mitigate these threats as the immediate concern of this group. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M725,3,7,France,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman and good morning to you all. I would like to return briefly to an issue that was raised earlier in the week, but at this stage in the discussion I feel it is relevant to return to it to an extent As to what may constitute a threat or what may be felt as such, beyond the legal considerations that have been voiced and which are in some cases valid, this group should ask questions As to whether explaining clearly that we are ready to use a satellite, a civilian satellite, to target That being a satellite, they state non-party to a conflict and to state it explicitly In the national United Nations Is explaining such a thing, Despite having put forward a draft treaty which we have defended, whilst at the same time remaining highly opaque as to one's own space activities, could that not potentially be considered as a threat and an irresponsible behaviour, Moreover, can one consider In parallel to this that the establishment by certain states Of national strategies in space.",2
S3M727,3,7,Indonesia,"My delegation would also like to contribute to the discussion on item 5 and, if I may, with a brief additional elements on item 4. Mr. Chair is shared by many. Indonesia also has a great concern on the possible use of force or threat or of use of force with regard to space objects or with their use, as well as the placement of weapons in outer space. The situation would potentially make space as a new, better domain which will run counter to objective of preventing arm race in outer space In this regard, my allegation underlies that state adherence and obligation to relevant applicable international law and legally binding instrument, including in particular outer speciality, are key to govern conduct of state in their activities in out of space and address these threats. Mr. Chair. In this discussion my Legation took note with interest some views that made a point on the importance of my streaming on binding norms, rules and principles that could give more room for flexibilities In guiding the conduct of state into space, including in outer space, while understanding this rational, my allegation believes that there is also need of robust transparency, good faith and concrete commitments by state to prevent militarization, militarization of outer space or relevant rates in space system and this should only be pursued or legally binding multilateral instrument which can complement existing instrument Pending the negotiation of such illegally burning human legacy, welcome the ensuing efforts at Motorola, including in this working group To elaborate norms, rules and principle of responsible behavior to prevent unrest of space as well as to promote aspiracy, capacity building and international cooperation. Substantive elaboration of rules, norms and principle of responsible behaviour, including on prevention of use of force or threat of use of force with regard to space, object or with their use, as well as the placement of weapons in other space, in this working group, we believe would only be effective. If they also lead or contribute the formation of liquid banning instrument on prevention of embracing outer space, I thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M729,3,7,Iran,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, distinguished colleagues. Mr. Chair, the prohibition of use of force, or threat to use of force as a fundamental principle in international law is vital for our work in this OEWG and particularly important to the upholding and preserving the peaceful. Nature of ultra-space As the common province of all. We emphasize that the principles of the UN Charter applies to the outer space. In this regard, and in accordance with the Article Two of the UN Charter as well as the Article Three of the OST, the use of force has been prohibited. This prohibition needs to be comprehensive, and we believe that would complement and would be in line with the goal of prevention of an arms race in order space. This should be done through the negotiation of a legally binding instrument to that end. The onus is on all of us. I thank you.",4
S3M731,3,7,Mexico,"Thank you very much, Chairman. I will be brief because I think that a number of the issues being dealt with under Topic 5 and topic 4, which are quite clearly interlinked, were addressed already by us in our general statement. Space law from my delegation standpoint is clear cut in as much as outer space should be used exclusively for people purposes and used to the benefits of all humanity. This, in our view, would apply broadly to present and future generations. Also, in a complementary way, following the provisions of the UN Charter which continue to apply to outer space, the Moon and other celestial bodies particularly, we support the prohibition on the threat of use of force or use of force provided for in Article Two of the Charter. Traditionally, Mexico has supported the resolutions on their first placement of weapons in outer space. But we have always explained at the same time that in no way can this accord legitimacy or legality to subsequent placement of weapons in outer space. As Algeria, Pakistan and Cuba rightly said, any placement runs counter to the basic tenets of the UN Charter and with regard to the Space Treaty itself. This explanation also goes for our understanding of legitimate defence. My delegation has been clear in the General Assembly and the Security Council that we oppose a definition that would allow for preventive religious friends, as Switzerland indicated Particularly bearing in mind that there are limitations that go beyond the charters, such as certain principles of IHL. This entire legal corpus would reaffirm that space should be preserved for purely peaceful purposes And he's Although in practice we have heard doctrine in practice from states who would appear to see space as a place for potential conflict, my delegation reiterates the need for the negotiation of a legally binding instrument to prevent the placement of weapons in outer space, In order to give meaning to the desire to prevent an arms race in outer space, which is guiding our work in the CD and other fora, A brief comment now on the issue of verification from the Mexican delegation standpoint. Without that technological development, which have been the grounds for discussion and which we have addressed very specifically in terms of an understanding of space-based threats, at the same time offer a welter of opportunities to enable precise identification as to how certain new technologies could offer tools. For effective verification, Which could feed into discussion on a legally binding instrument. I thank you, the Chair.",4
S3M733,3,7,Canada,"I just wanted to help up the debate here real quickly by pointing out that under Article 103 of the UN Charter, the rights and obligations in the UN Charter prevail over any other treaties. The effect of that is as follows. If there's any obligation in a treaty or any provision in a treaty that either deviates from or is inconsistent with the UN Charter, then the provision in the UN Charter would override it. And that's one of the reasons why it's very difficult and very rarely seen in treaties that you attempt to define or change the definition of the use of force, Because any such attempt, if it was inconsistent with or in any other way different from that definition, would simply return back to the UN Charter. So for instance, in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, there's approximately 3 references to use of force, and they repeat Article 24 almost verbatim so that they don't deviate. So the message here is you can certainly reaffirm principles of international law that already exists, such as the prohibition on the use of force, but you can't change them or alter them. So, as our distinguished colleagues from the United States pointed out, if there are differences between any definition of reaffirmation that you attempt to create Will simply return back to the definition in the UN Charter or the provision in the UN Charter. And it's also worth noting that the final clause in the Article 24 talks about any use of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. Article 1 list the purposes and I won't read them out. You can. I'll go to the gift shop and buy the little book if you want and read the purposes. But they're very, very broad, meaning there's an extensive coverage. The prohibition on the use of force is extensively set out In the UN Charter And therefore, reaffirming it is certainly acceptable, but attempting to redefine it is really a bit of an exercise in futility because you'll always go back to the UN Charter, which again is already very comprehensive prohibition. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",2
S3M735,3,7,Nigeria,"Thank you for giving Nigeria before Mr. Chair. A delegation believes that the codification of the duty of due regard into what could possibly translate into the establishment of a future legally binding instrument on space activities. Remains an utmost concern. Earlier in the week, my delegation reiterated the need for the existence of concrete non usage assurances to safeguard states who have not developed the capability to weaponize space systems. This is with a view to ensure non-interference and the peaceful uses of space systems carried out by such states. Chair, existing jurisprudence on the law of the sea clarifies that the duty of due regard represents a balancing of rights and interests between and among States and between States and the international community as a whole. Therefore, my delegation is favourably disposed towards the enshrinement of this key principle into a more binding document which could hopefully emerge from this OEWG process States conducting certain activities in outer space which could be misinterpreted as undue use of force, should be required to carry out adequate consultations which states that may be affected by such activities, particularly states with dissimilar capabilities. This underpinning principle seeks to ensure that the use of space systems is carried out without discrimination of any kind, while also preventing an arms race in outer space. Furthermore, this principle can only be strengthened, true negotiations of a more binding measure to prohibit the use of force in outer space, including the placement of WMD's in outer space, this key focus remains crucial to our work in this OEWG. Thank you.",4
S3M737,3,7,Brazil,"My delegation had already articulated in its intervention on the topic one its views regarding the applicability of international Law 12 to space, in particular the UN Charter. This is well known. Article 2.4 of the UN Charter prohibits the use or threat of use of force Reaffirming the applicability in outer space of Article 2.4 and its general prohibition is a necessary element of any new development in the international normative and legal framework applicable to that environment. We need to move further. However, any use of force in outer space would have potentially serious, persistent and unpredictable consequences. Therefore, the legal barrier against it should necessarily be higher and stronger, as we have indicated in our intervention on the topic one as well. Brazil believes that the principles of international humanitarian law, in particular those of precaution, proportionality and distinction, are key to an understanding of why use of force in outer space. In particular, through kinetic means must be avoided at all costs, as the Chinese delegation has eloquently put it, or in outer space cannot be won and must never be fought. As regards Article 51 of the Charter, my delegation concurs with the understanding expressed by the delegation of Switzerland earlier in the session. Any resort to this right in connection with space objects needs to be understood in an extremely restrictive manner. In particular, it should not be used as a justification to attack space objects in response to armed attacks on Earth or to carry out preventive attacks against space objects. This OEWG has an opportunity to clarify these key legal concepts that are already enshrined in international law and chart the course towards future developments in the legal framework applicable to outer space. Doing so will bring us closer to the objective of preventing an arms race and an armed conflict in outer space, and of preserving outer space as a peaceful environment. Thank you.",4
S3M739,3,7,New Zealand,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, I would like to very quickly lend my voice in support of the position stated by other delegations who have spoken to calls by a small number of delegations for a legally binding instrument which would prohibit the use of force or threats of the use of force in outer space. Any instrument was focused on such a prohibition in the space context is duplicative of existing international law, especially including the United Nations Charter. Such an approach would at best be redundant and risk creating uncertainty about the applicability of existing international legal frameworks to space activities. I would also like to address this submission of the distinguished delegate of the Russian Federation who claimed that a commitment not to test direct descent anti satellite missiles Was insufficient, given states who had made this commitment had already tested this capability Quite apart from the fact that Russia has tested an anti-satellite capability, I would remind the delegate that many states have made this commitment having never tested such capability. New Zealand is one of them. To be clear, New Zealand strongly supports efforts towards the prevention of an arms race in space. We are committed to ensuring a peaceful, safe, stable, secure and sustainable space environment, but we believe the best way to do that is for this OEWG to elaborate a series of shared norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour. This approach can help to improve transparency and to reduce the risk of misperception, misunderstanding and escalation. Rather than making a conflict inevitable, this approach can help for stall the development of a conflict scenario. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M741,3,7,Russia,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have listened closely To the various comments delivered by delegations on this topic. We would like To offer additional comments by way of our contribution to the interactive discussion in addition to our statement. Firstly, We are very interested by the logic that we heard from a series of delegations concerning Article Two of the UN Charter And It's absolute sufficiency for Preventing the use of force or threats of use of force against space objects or with space objects. Firstly, in our view, Those delegations Have not always been consistent with their own logic Because With regards to other topics that we have already discussed. They for some reason have indicated that that standard is not enough That the norms enforce Require apparently Some more detailed discussion More specific clarification as to their implementation Here now the logic is the reverse. We have UN Charter Article 2 What is being More is needed apparently Is there any need for any further explanation as to how that article could be specifically applied to outer space.  We don't quite understand this logical dichotomy from the delegations concerned, If we follow this logical conclusion that this standard is enough. Then in our view We could simply bring this working group's work to an end and simply state that the existing norms are enough, the Outer Space Treaty, for example. Since the Outer Space Treaty, Article 4 thereof Provides In very clear terms As well as in other articles Covering In full various aspects of space activity Maybe the only Obligation that would need to be assumed in addition to the Space Treaty and the UN Charter, would be to ban placement of weapons in space Which As it stands, is a lacuna in terms of the documents I mentioned. Since as we said Part of outer space is completely demilitarized. Let us take on the obligation to demilitarize all of it. Let it be done But In the course of the previous session, we became convinced that There are quite significant threats in Outer space. As we've heard from certain delegations, Our delegation also has an understanding of what we consider to be particularly relevant threats requiring resolution in terms of space activity, and that is why we have met in this OEWG and continue this discussion. This concerns, for example, the use of force and the threat the use of force against space objects or with space objects, and here we would like to support the delegations of Brazil and Mexico. Who when they took the floor Indicated that the implementation Of Article Two of the Charter really needs a clear cut understanding of the issues at stake In view of the issue at stake being the prevention of any force or threat of force against space objects. If we wish to preserve space, As a Demilitarized Zone. As a zone that is to be used strictly for peaceful purposes. We then need consequently to take the necessary corresponding measures, assuming obligations and norms, in order to prevent Space becoming an arena for under conflict to prevent force being used or the use of force against space objects. This is very relevant in the view of the doctrinal policy of certain states, which has been clearly set out viewing outer space as an arena for armed conflict, or space being deemed to be a space where military operations may take place and where there's a clear policy statement of the desire to achieve dominance over outer space. For us it is absolutely clear that such doctrinal policy Would propose the force or the use or the threat of force against space. Object. Would propose the potential placement of capability in outer space or which would be aimed at ensuring that dominance into ALIA through military methods. And it is for that reason that we are posing the question of the prevention of the use of force Or threat of use of force against basic objects or with space objects And that is why we are proposing that all states, including states, who have put in place and are implementing such a doctrine, to assume specific obligations, not to allow any use of force or threat thereof against based objects or with space objects. Now I would like to react to the comments of the distinguished delegate from New Zealand And target of New Zealand Tried to claim that just a handful of countries supports taking obligations related to the prevention of the use of force or threat of use of force against space objects or with the help of space objects. That is not the case. We would like to remind the distinguished delegate of New Zealand the numerous statements. That were made, for example, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement And that movement includes more than 120 countries And in all of those statements. We hear a clear message related to the need to adopt legally binding norms and obligations related to the prevention of the use of force or the threat of use of force against space objects, and also Preventing the placement of weapons in outer space and the adoption of a relevant, legally binding instrument. Moreover, we would also like to refer distinguished Representative New Zealand to the numerous resolutions of the UN General Assembly supported by the vast majority of UN Member States, and those resolutions. Clearly say or clearly reflect the desire of States, Members of the United Nations and the international community to realize the objectives related to the preparation of a legally binding instrument that'll include robust safeguards related to the prevention of the placement of weapons In outer space and the use or threat of use of force against space objects. So This is why we would like to Ask the delegate of New Zealand night to simply Replace the facts that are obvious and use those facts in our work here and not try to mislead this working group Now On the initiative Related to the to a moratorium on destructive direct ascent anti-satellite weapons. If a state that joins such initiatives is truly expressing its Goodwill aimed at removing space debris Or avoid having space debris in space or remove any threats from such systems. And I'm referring to destructive directors and anti-satellite weapons, so let us then Talk about a ban on the production of such systems, A ban on the use of such systems. Why are we only talking about testing Now, if such systems are used, we will not have a large amount of space debris And if such systems are developed, doesn't that pose the threat of them actually being used And the existing potentials now, don't they already create such a threat Well, we believe that they indeed do create such a threat, an obvious threat that Still is present Well, let's then take decisive and comprehensive steps to remove such threats And not trying to draw a veil before the eyes of the international community And be a bit hypocritical, When we talk about removing such a threat through a moratorium on testing And especially since this is being done not through the adoption of legally binding norms and obligations. But on the basis of declaratory political measures. Which are not specific that can be interpreted in different ways And We already heard during the discussions here in this group that the category of weapons that are called destructive director sense Anti-satellite weapons does not include certain systems Or this does not cover systems that allegedly can be used for peaceful purposes While still having the same physical and technical parameters or characteristics As the systems that allegedly fall into that category of devices, this all leads to many, many questions related to the initiative And we believe that it doesn't alleviate the concerns that several delegations, some delegations had Concerns that the this initiative is simply trying to move some air around And then this initiative from a practical point of view, doesn't bring anything new. Thank you.",4
S3M743,3,7,Brazil,"My intervention is an attempt to Participate in the interactive discussions that we've been having in this working group, which a delegation believes is very positive. I'd like in particular to address the Observations made with regard to the value or the black they're off of a of the proposed moratorium on the testing of direct descent anti-satellite testing a mortar that as many know Brazil has supported and Co-sponsored in the General Assembly General Assembly resolution. My delegation believes that this moratorium is insufficient per se and concurs with that assessment, as we believe that the other previous moratorium in other areas have also been insufficient, but we believe that these political commitments have a value In the sense that they contribute to creating a positive political environment and as well they remove the incentives for the actions that they address and prevent the negative consequences, immediate consequences that they might have The same applies to the moratorium on the placements of weapons in outer space, which my country has also supported and adhere to in that case. This is similar, in our view, to the approach that was followed in the field in the realm of nuclear disarmament. We didn't arrive at the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty all at once. We started with partial commitments, the LTBT, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, Before we actually could take this, the step of adopting A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And this of course is not the CTBT is not self-contained in itself. It is a measure conducive to nuclear disarmament, that is to the elimination of nuclear weapons. And this is certainly what the same, the same objective that we pursue with these discussions and with the moratorium on ASAP weapons, it's the ultimate banning of those weapons. So this, this is, this our view on this, and we just wanted to clarify it in our debate. Thank you very much.",2
S3M745,3,7,Algeria,"You can't see the rise is my holy fee. Ujala al Musharraf Cafe had Al Nikashi at thank you chair. At the outset, I'd like to say that I'm very pleased with us having this interactive dialogue. That is indeed a very good way of discussing these very important topics for the work of our group. We are happy that the basic principle related to the rejection of the use of force or the threat of use of force, is being discussed here In a very positive way, it is important principle that should be Should guide us here in our discussions in this group and We have seen that there's a general consensus on the fact that the principle of international law And the UN international treaties apply To outer space. In other words, That one cannot Have any recourse to the use of force or threaten the use of force, and I'd like to use this opportunity to say once again that If we believe that existing rules and United Nations treaties are sufficient to prevent the use of force or the threat of use of force in outer space. If those are sufficient, well, I find that to be an exaggeration because We all should remember that international law is something that evolves And This may Have someone believe that we don't need any additional Norms, and that means that we do need Any additional Negotiations But however these negotiations will be held in the United Nations, would reflect the decisions that were taken by the UN General Assembly that simply confirmed the importance of having such negotiations and taking such efforts. Now the United Nations Charter Is the Supreme Document that Defines the principles, and every time we need to see an evolution in such norms, we need negotiations with a view of reaching legally binding legal instruments that reflect the principles Found in the UN Charter and will make them better adapted To the evolution of the situation The event charter is The legal framework that applies in such situations And treaty simply reflect this evolution in order to better implement these principles of the Unchartered to a specific context. Current documents that exist, Do not lead us to believe that we should not continue our work and we see that the situation requires that we have such discussions here, As we have, These reflections on different disarmament questions And we see that a majority of Countries believes that we need new rules that will reflect the requirements of the moment, new international instruments that would respond to the consensus and also reflect the need that we have to have a consensus. Today, it is necessary to respond to the need to preserve Peace and stability in outer space it is Necessary to coordinate between existing rules and the rules that have to be negotiated And also to have non-binding rules that with a view of building Trust, which will be a step towards a more robust. Position that enjoys broad international support. My delegation believes that today we need to take into account the need to strike a balance between binding and non-binding. Rules and not try to choose one or the other The complementarity between these Two classes of principles will help us and will be beneficial to the work of the group of experts that will be launched very soon And this will be very beneficial to our future work And hopefully that decision will be taken at the end of The work of this group. So I'd like to insist on the fact that We must continue our work The majority is in favor of such work on this subject. Thank you.",4
S3M747,3,7,Peru,"Thank you very much. At the outset, I would like to express the pleasure Peru seeing you chairing the work of this group and rest assured of our full support as you implement your mandate now. Peru has always been fully committed to international law and multilateralism as the guiding principles of our foreign policies in the face of the serious challenges we face today that threaten the stability and The force of existing norms And we should ensure that we preserve peaceful coexistence in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Peru was one of the first countries in Latin America to sign up to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and also other outer space treaties. Now on the question of the principles related to the use of forts and emerging threats Related to activities of states in outer space. Well, in all of this I have to say that one of the corners there is of the International Order is the prevention of the use of force that is incompatible with any of the provisions of the UN Charter, especially Article 2.4 of the Charter that Bands of the use of force in international relations, and we are concerned that some countries are using arguments that question this fundamental rule. These arguments simply do not comply with international law. Now, of special interest are the discussions of this topic here in this group Including the possibility to reaffirm this fundamental obligation of countries, we also like to recall that one of the fundamental principles of the UN is the preservation of international peace and security And to defend and promote an international rule order based on rules So, Chairman, to prevent an arms race and armed conflicts in outer space is part of this work, and it implies an additional responsibility in order to preserve the system of International Security that is effective and predictable, especially in outer space. And the exploitation and exploration of outer space should be carried out to the benefit of all mankind. Thank you.",4
S3M749,3,7,Mexico,"Muchas gracias presidente. Thank you very much. I'll be brief in order to contribute to the interactive discussion that we're having here and also to clarify the position of Mexico and the delegation of Mexico and Belize that there's legal structure that already is in existence and it obviously applies to outer space. For example, general, Provisions, for example, those contained in the UN Charter and also specific provisions contained in space law, but this does not mean that we believe that These provisions or these norms are not clear Or May lead to misunderstandings. For us, the threat and use of force and everything it involves is very clear and the principles are very clear. Except for the situations provided for in the UN Charter, we believe that law should reflect The social Relationships in the international community and we have seen some specific realities appear in outer space, so it'll be useful for the international Community to have clarity about such activities and Have regulations that give effect to existing general norms, and This is why we believe that it is crucial to negotiate legally binding instruments Both from the point of view of the political need of international community to have clarity, but also To Be assured that there's responsibility for Activities carried out in outer space. Also, I'd like to be clear that We do not believe that legally binding norms are the only way to ensure progress in regulation of responsible behaviour in outer space. We see that there are other measures. For example, confidence building measures, transparency related measures that may provide this clarity. To countries about behaviour and also, Eventually they can also be converted into legally binding norms, but there are also situations or behaving that require legally binding norms. Without the need To have this interim step of non-binding measures We may have the need in respect of certain threats or behavior, When we need to have legally binding norms that govern such behavior, This is how my delegation Sees the viability of moratoria or policies that for example like for example, The resolution related to a SAT. That can be considered as provisional measures, giving countries certain states related to how to carry out activities in outer space that eventually can turn into legally binding norms in specific cases. Thank you.",4
S3M751,3,7,Pakistan,"Thank you, Chair. We also appreciate this opportunity to participate in this interactive debate. And in that spirit, we would like to take the floor again just to clarify and add and make our contribution to this ongoing debate. Some very useful comments have been put forward by several distinguished delegates and we would also like to emphasize in addition to our previous remarks that we are not arguing when we talk about the prohibitions in Article 2.4 of the UN Charter. We are not arguing that they are not clear or they are ambiguous, but we believe strongly that they are not enough. The prohibition on threat or use of force in international relations is not enough to govern our outer space activities. Had they been enough, we wouldn't have had Paris, the agenda item of prevention of arms race in outer space, on our disarmament agenda for decades Had there been enough, we wouldn't have the paragraph 80 of SSOD 1 outcome document. And again, of course, had they been enough, we wouldn't have had the prohibition contained in Article Four of the Outer Space Treaty, which explicitly bans. The placement of weapons of mass destruction in outer space and demilitarizes moon and other celestial bodies, so which is why we strongly believe that there is an urgent need to build on this prohibition on the threat or use of force because of the risks that we have highlighted in our previous statements and earlier in this week. Thank you.",4
S3M753,3,7,Australia,"We are pleased that there appears to be consensus that Article 2 four of the UN Charter applies to prohibit the threat or use of force in space, just as it does on Earth. We have heard some delegations raise concerns that this is not sufficient for Australia. Article 2 four of the UN Charter is sufficient as a legal prohibition on the threat or use of force. However, we recognize that this prohibition has not entirely prevented states threatening or using force on Earth And as such, States remain concerned with the possibility of a threat or use of force against them in space. This is where norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours have a part to play As many states have discussed over the past three days, lack of transparency and communication has the potential for activities to be misunderstood as a threat or use of force. We share many states views that this risk of misunderstanding can be mitigated by states communicating and making notifications of their space related activities, Further, we propose that states should establish, maintain, and utilize communication channels to resolve concerns about international peace and security that arise from space activities. A commitment by states to these responsible behaviors could reduce the risk of misunderstandings and misperceptions that have the potential to lead to conflict. Thank you.",4
S3M755,3,7,Japan,"German and Japan is happy to reaffirm the applicability of the existing international law. Both use antebellum and use in below in the outer space. As accurately pointed out by many previous speakers, prohibition of use of force and threat of use of force provided for in the UN Charter as well as in the Outer Space Treaty, should be applied in the outer space. Also, the international Humanitarian law is also applied in the outer space. We are bound by these provisions and obligations. Japan is happy to reaffirm these principles also in this opened working group, without trying to redefine, What to debugging these principles here. On the other hand, as one of the specific countries and also in the light of the mandate given to this open, open engine working group, Japan believes it is constructive to focus our efforts here on developing common understanding about what constitutes responsible and irresponsible behaviors, without necessarily going into the discussions about the illicitness of these actions. Actually, we feel placed under the continual threat arising from irresponsible actions in outer space activities. We should like this working group to produce tangible and pragmatic outcomes which help us and mutually avoiding conducting irresponsible behaviors that threat our outer space activities, especially when they are conducive to an escalation through misunderstanding and miscalculation. We are not opposed to genuine aspiration for a new legal binding rules in this field, expressed some of the previous speakers. Although I believe that aspiration would be better addressed on other occasions, I would like to add that if we can achieve a common understanding of responsible or irresponsible behaviors in these working group that also contribute to facilitating a future discussion On legal binding instrument why it take place. Thank you very much.",4
S3M757,3,7,Iran,"You can say the rise. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to reiterate what was mentioned, but the representative of Algeria and I would like to stress Iraq unwavering position in this regard Outer space must remain only for peaceful purposes. It should not be militarized. Countries should abide by responsible behaviour and to work collectively to end the risks that might face the international community. Because of the use of force in outer space, Iraq has expressed in many occasions. Its support to all initiatives aiming at promoting peaceful and equitable use of outer space, Mr. Chair. A scientific advancement adds to the risk of militarization of outer space. Therefore, it is important to recommit to the prohibition of the use of force or the threat they're off in outer space. Therefore, legally binding international instrument on the prohibition of militarization of outer space is in order and it is in line with the UN purposes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",4
S3M759,3,7,China,"So under this agenda regarding prevention of threat or use of force. I heard many interesting views, so like it is not necessary to have Explicit Article or Treaty to Reflect. The basic principles regarding Threat and use Force enshrined in UN Charter And I also learned some concerns that to have a new treaty or articles Would just put new risks That to deviate from or be inconsistent with the legal rules contained in the Charter, but I'm afraid it's not the case. So regarding, These basic principles no matter that the reference from thread User force or the self-defense articles in the charter. I think there's no disagrees that we're still facing the challenges brought by the ambiguities of the key legal terms, just as mentioned by some of our colleagues just now And I noticed that United States also agreed that That's no the the threat of use of force is not expressly stipulated or it lacks data in the document CD 1998 paragraph 11 So we are facing, I think, a significant problem that is about interpretation of treaty. I mean the principles in the Charter. Then according to Article 31 of the VCLT, I mean the Vienna Convention of the law of treaty It provides for Some references in context of the interpretation of cheating So in the third paragraph I allow me just read it out A. Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the Treaty or the application of its provisions. B. Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. So right now we are talking about the refrain from the thread use force or the excess of self-defense. So we're facing the two choices To have the further clarification through subsequent agreement or subsequent practice Which one do we prefer, So it just shows that it's valuable. To talk about, to discuss this key term, to interpret these key legal terms just through the process of negotiating a new treaty or new articles. So I think that's the first point and then I also noticed that. Some delegates mentioned that we should be cautious to talk about self-defense And should set a strict conditions for the excess of self-defense in the outer space. I actually agree with that and I think it just shows that the significance To interpret These key legal terms Through a new platform. I think a new treaty just provide for such a platform And some other delegates also mentioned that I gave a very good example Said the kinetic just use kinetic message to destroy all damage to cause damage to others space object. It could be deemed as user force. It just leads to a very very interesting question that whether it would not be deemed as a use of force if just the damage was caused by non-kinetic methods. So all these key concerns in this room, I believe that it could be only be solved by interpretation of treaty or just talking about drafting a new treaty, rather than to clarify or to try to define what is irresponsible or responsible. Because these are serious, they are legal terms. They cannot be taken care Through a responsible, irresponsible dichotomy. Thank you, Chair.",2
S3M761,3,7,Canada,"Thank you, Chair. My remarks pertain to topic number six The most important activity in space that should enjoy protection is human Space Flight. This is a particular importance to Canada as we look ahead to the Artemis 2 mission that will see the return of humans to the Moon. We are very proud that a Canadian astronaut will be a member of the crew of this mission and that will be only the 2nd nation on Earth to have an astronaut orbit around the moon, All norms, rules and principles considered by this body should have the primacy of human spaceflight in mind The Canada Esteem Canada also considers That actions may compromise the provision of Space services with a grave risk for the security of persons and goods or objects are irresponsible may be perceived as a menace or threat. This includes the risk of creating debris, as we have recently seen with the International Space Station Being obliged to manoeuvre on a number of occasions in order to avoid the numerous Debris created by a recent anti-satellite test carried out by Russia. This also covers Actions which hamper satellites in providing crucial information, such as navigation information provided to airplanes to avoid collisions or data, Used by emergency responders in the wake of major catastrophes. These effects will intensify as Earth based activities make ever greater use of space-based services. Responsible behaviour would involve refraining intentionally from putting into danger the safety and security of persons and critical infrastructure. This is in the interest of all countries. Canada would therefore favour A norm to the effect that states should not undertake or deliberately support actions that damage or intentionally interrupt the functioning of satellites used for essential infrastructure or which are providing essential services to the public Or, given the importance of these space objects in supporting our daily life here on Earth, we believe it's worth reiterating 2 norms in particular that many other delegations have already mentioned this week in the context of other topics, but are just as relevant to this discussion as we look at space objects that should enjoy protection. These are that states should ensure satellites under their jurisdiction or control do not physically interact with satellites under the jurisdiction or control of another state without prior consultation and consent And that state should ensure satellites under their jurisdiction or control do not conduct proximity operations with a satellite under the jurisdiction or control of another state in a manner that would impair the safe operation of the satellites. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M763,3,7,Netherlands,"Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the floor. In addition to what our Canadian colleagues stated and which we would fully support, the Netherlands would just like to comment briefly on the notion of object, of activities in outer space that should enjoy protection. What enjoys protection is not only to be determined on the basis of the five UN treaties in outer space, but also as obligated in those treaties and in particular under Article Three of the OST, on the basis of international law in general. We would thank the ICRC for its recommendations on this topic and consider that they could be taken into account Space systems will often enjoy protection under international law, including humanitarian law, for their critical role in the functioning of human life on Earth. In view of the significant risk of harm to the population on Earth and the environment, State should refrain at all times from conducting and or supporting activities that would impair space systems necessary For the provision of essential civilian services and for the protection and functioning of persons and objects specifically protected under international law Do this may be added that space systems, particularly weather, communications, navigation and Earth observations and imaging satellites, contribute to every phase of humanitarian operations, from needs assessments to emergency relief delivery and from Disaster Risk Reduction to resilience building and protected conflicts. In the view of my delegation, international law dictates that, in considering what enjoys protection, this should all be taken into account. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M765,3,7,United States,"Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to discuss topic 4 on sorry at this point topic 6 on norms, rules and principles relating to outer space objects or activities that should enjoy protection. The United States appreciates the addition of this topic to the OEWGs agenda, as it is an extremely important one to discuss. Mr. Chairman, from the beginning of international discussions in the United Nations on outer space, significant emphasis was placed on protecting humans conducting activities in outer space. Given the incredibly challenge, the incredible challenges of working in the inhospitable outer space environment State Parties to the Outer Space Treaty agreed to regard astronauts as envoys of mankind, and quote shall render to them all possible assistance in the event of accidents, distress, or emergency landing on the territory of another State party or on the high seas. End Quote. Additionally, State parties were required to immediately inform the other States parties to the Treaty or to the Secretary General of the United Nations of any phenomena they discover in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, which could constitute a danger to the life or health of astronauts. The agreement on the rescue of astronauts, the return of astronauts and the return of objects launched into outer space elaborated on the principles in Article Five of the Outer Space Treaty. In the coming years, the number of humans in orbit Will grow far beyond the 10 in orbits today. As we consider developing norms, rules and principles, we should consider what steps all states should take to ensure that activities in space, whether national security or civil, avoid endangering human spaceflight activities. One well known example of how reckless military activities in space can threaten human lives was Russia's Destructive Direct Descent Anti Satellite missile test in November 2021. Immediately following Russia's test, the crew of the International Space Station were directed to shelter in their escape capsules during two passes near the vicinity of the debris cloud from this test, The space station was passing through or near that debris cloud every 90 minutes at a time When the precise location of the debris was not fully understood. Additionally, the United States and Russia have maneuvered the space station twice in June and October of last year to avoid debris from this ASAP test. This was one of the motivations behind the United States decision to commit not to conduct destructive direct descent anti-satellite missile tests and why we are encouraging all countries to make similar commitments. Additionally, the United States believes that the open-ended working group should consider what steps states could take to reduce threatening behaviors in outer space from impacting these types of activities Many countries during these discussions have also noted the impact that the use of counter space weapons could have on critical infrastructure. I was struck by a presentation last year by the ICRC on how they will use space to provide disaster relief during conflicts or other events, and the implications for their operations should they lose access to those systems. The United States agrees that harmful interference with space-based services that constitute or support critical infrastructure such as global navigation satellite services, could have widespread impacts on society. In this regard, we should look carefully at international humanitarian law and consider how it applies to human Space Flight activities and the impact upon essential civilian services and humanitarian assistance in the event of a conflict. Additionally, in the United States is working paper, we note that interfering with space traffic management services could create space flight safety risks. Which could lead to misunderstandings and potentially be destabilizing And finally, as I discussed earlier this week, we would welcome a discussion at the open-ended working group about other activities that could cause harmful interference, including on space based nuclear command and control systems and missile launch warning capabilities. We look forward to discussing these and additional proposals with colleagues here at the open-ended work group. Thank you.",0
S3M767,3,7,Philippines,"Mr. Chair, as my delegation has repeatedly stressed, outer space security should transcend the traditional system of strategic equilibrium, informed by great power dynamics. For our discussion to be truly inclusive, we should take into account the security concerns of all States, including developing countries. The Philippine Development Plan and the National Security Policy of the Philippines recognizes the cross cutting nature of national security. One of its components is the protection of critical infrastructure, strategic assets and natural resources. Recalling our first paper with Germany submitted during the second session of this OEWG, we reiterate that the space operations and activities must be conducted with due regard to the following. First, the use of space systems and services for national security. Second, the provision of critical space based services to the public. In addition, we believe that the following space activities, particularly by developing countries, should be at all times protected. First, the contact of scientific research and development. Space is a valuable, valuable asset to the conduct of scientific and technological activities in areas of human research, space medicine, life sciences, biotechnology, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology, impairment of or disruption the space laboratories and space missions. It slows down the delivery of important information, discoveries or technological technologies that could have been used in advancing astronautics, development of drugs for treatment of diseases, conduct of material science, and astronomical studies with potential Earth based applications among others. Second, the use of space systems and services for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Space is a powerful vantage point for monitoring the Earth and changes in its climate system, as many key climate variables can only be measured from the space. Access this space has enabled technology based solutions to reduce climate risk under global warming. The need to protect space objects involved in these activities underscores the importance of developing norms, rules and principles that should apply in times of peace. In this regard, we reiterate the seven Principles of Responsible Behaviors that we have put forward in our working paper with Germany. Of these seven recommendations, we wish to highlight the following. First, state should not conduct or knowingly support activities that lead to the loss of life, operational control or reversible damage or permanent loss of space systems of another state. These include, in addition to kinetic means, cyber, electromagnetic or laser interference. Second, states should not conduct or knowingly support activities that impair the provision of space-based services critical to the public, including those used for humanitarian assistance and disaster response And severely affect or even harm civilians. Again, these include in addition to kinetic means, cyber, electromagnetic or laser interference. In particular, states should not impair the provision of positioning, navigation, and timing signals from space. Outer space should remain exclusively for peaceful purposes and will oppose any attempt to turn outer space into a war fighting domain. Nonetheless, in the event of armed conflict, outer space objects that are crucial to the space-based activities we have just mentioned Must be protected. This underscores the need for this group to reaffirm the applicability of international humanitarian law. Thank you, Mr. Chair.",0
S3M769,3,7,Germany,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. As it has already many times stated during our session, this time and also last time. The well-being of people and the functioning of our societies and modern economies increasingly depends on services provided by space systems, and that is exactly the reason why we believe that it is irresponsible to conduct or to knowingly support activities. That can impair the provision of such space-based services critical to the public and by this severely affect or even harm civilians, As we outlayed in our joint working paper on last session And as it was mentioned by my Philippine colleague, just. A few moments ago such space based critical services include positioning, navigation and timing as well as earth and weather observation and satellite communication used for Civil Aviation for shipping. For emergency response and rescue services, communications, energy supply and other critical infrastructures.  The impairment or even disruption of such critical services could surpass a critical threshold and therefore lead to the loss of life of people or damage to property. Considering that such many civilian applications today depend on the accurate provision of positioning, navigation and timing and communication Just So A particular case in point we would like to make for systems for disaster response As it was also pointed out by the delegates from the Philippines. For natural hazard prone countries, such as countries, for example in the Inter Pacific regions, space systems are crucial in preparing for and responding to and mitigating. The adverse impact of natural disasters that are, as it was also pointed out now, further accessibility by the climate change. So reliable and real time space data and communication enable timely response to calamities with the aim of preventing such casualties, reducing the economic and material impacts of disasters, and they also proved to be valuable to frontline responders during relief and rehabilitation efforts. But states also rely on space systems for situational awareness, for reconnaissance, navigation, communication Indication and warning and the impairment or disruption of command and control systems and space systems used for especially early warning and strategic stability, can lead to the substantial risk of unwanted escalation, the loss of early warning functions, for instance. We will most likely be considered profoundly escalatory and threatening by many states. So our conclusion on this point therefore is that state should not, should also not impair the provision of space based services needed for strategic stability and early warning. And that we have also explicitly stated in our last working paper that we submitted together with the Philippines and that was Co-sponsored By Nigeria. Thank you.",0
S3M771,3,7,Switzerland,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A number of space systems Provide essential services to the civilian population in areas such as communications transport And food production Attacks against such systems Could entail serious consequences for populations. Here we would underscore that space systems providing essential services to the civilian population. You should enjoy special protection under international humanitarian law. That is something they enjoy. Above and beyond that consideration we wish To underscore and endorse the very relevant point made by the ICRC in the working documents submitted for this meeting. In view of the significant risk to the civilian population, states should at all times refrain IE not just during periods of conflict, refrain from undertaking activities that may impair Space systems that are necessary for the provision of essential civilian services, be this on an occasional or permanent basis. The working group of the ICRC provides more detail as to the nature of such essential services Against this backdrop We wish to make clear that we fully support Recommendation one of the working documents submitted by the ICRC Which this group also should endorse.  Further we underscore that manned space objects Should be included amongst those enjoying special protection. In addition, We draw attention To the IHL rules that apply to armed conflict We recall that in the course of such conflict, IHL prohibits Attacks to destroy Remove or render unusable Infrastructure or goods which are essential to the survival of the civilian population. Persons and infrastructure that enjoys special protections, such as medical services and cultural heritage should be duly respected and protected, With that in mind, we consider that systems providing essential services to the civilian population Could be specifically marked in order that they could be identified as enjoying that special status further, as the ICRC underlines in its working paper Satellites providing essential services to the civilian population should, wherever possible, be clearly dissociated from those undertaking military Endeavors in order to ensure that civilians and infrastructure can be protected from potential consequences of military action. As such, we fully support recommendation two of the working paper submitted by the ICRC. I thank you, Chairman.",2
S3M773,3,7,United Kingdom,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, the purpose of our work in this OEWG is to explore how threats to space systems can be reduced, taking into account the critical importance of all elements of these systems to our societies, our economies, our entire way of life The UK working paper proposes a number of norms that we believe would contribute to protecting these systems. The UK would also like to add our voice to that of Canada and the US and others regarding the need to protect human space flights. In addition, and for the purposes of this topic, we would focus on 2 broad categories of space systems, Where harm to these systems would have particularly grave effects A small number of states possess space systems upon which the whole world depends. In particular, as other delegations have noted, global navigation satellite systems such as the Global Positioning System And Baidu provide vital position, navigation and timing signals that enable a vast array of social and economic activity in most countries As we have set out in our working paper, states should avoid jamming or spoofing activities against space systems that generate collateral impacts on civilian activity over large areas, such as disruption of air traffic or emergency responders, Even if these are temporary effects, the significant risks to life and safety demand that countries with jamming or spoofing capabilities act with self-restraint and in accordance with existing legal obligations Causing irreversible or permanent damage to global navigation satellite systems is likely to have a profound and prolonged effect on the lives of citizens and the economic well-being of countries. It therefore risks retaliation and escalation. This is one reason why the UK has proposed a new norm that states should therefore commit not to cause the permanent loss of command and control of other countries satellites. Mr. Chair, a number of states, a small number of states, possess space systems of the highest strategic importance Such systems include satellites and related ground components used for ballistic missile early warning Nuclear command, control and communication And intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance. These space capabilities are vital for detecting activities that might suggest the preparation of hostilities. For example, the build-up of forces, posture changes and moves to heightened readiness. They are also necessary for identifying the launch of ballistic missiles. The effective operation of such space systems is vital for preventing miscalculation and misperception, Interference, accidental or deliberate, with space systems involved in a state's nuclear deterrence architecture could trigger escalation without effective crisis management and prevention tools in place. It is vital that nuclear states maintain strong national measures to prevent unauthorised or intended use of nuclear weapons. Additionally, they should take measures to avoid the inadvertent compromise of critical space components that underpin the operation of nuclear systems That concludes our remarks on topic 6. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair Affected this.",0
S3M775,3,7,Russia,"Thank you very much, Chair. At the outset, Please allow my delegation to reject the insinuations That were made by some Western countries related to the space activities of the Russian Federation As we already said Throwing in such accusations is really something that cannot be justified, We stress once again that all activities carried out by the Russian Federation in outer space Are of a peaceful nature In full compliance with the international obligations of the Russian Federation And they are not targeting anyone. Now on The test that took place on the 15th November 2021 that is of such great concern to our Western colleagues, some test that was successfully carried out by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. We once again would like to say that, As a result of that test Non-functioning Russian Space Device named Selena de Was targeted. It was in orbit since 1982. This test took place in full compliance with international law, including the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 And it wasn't targeting anyone else. In light of the time of the test and the parameters of the orbit, The resulting space debris or fragments that were created did not represent a threat And do not create any obstacles or difficulties To the functioning of orbital stations Space objects and space activities, Such fragments were introduced into the main catalogue Of the national system of monitoring outer space And Were immediately immediately received follow-up Until the point where they no longer existed, Such activities were carried out as part of Planned Activities and Ministry of Defense of Russia In order to ensure the defense needs, Aimed at preventing any Damage to the activities of my country in outer space And I'm preventing any unexpected Infliction of damage to the security of the country In outer space and on the ground By existing or future space devices of other countries. Now on the question that has been introduced as a separate topic, topic number six. So we'll be quite honest, we did not prepare any separate statement on this issue Because We did not fully understand what we were supposed to talk about here under topic 6. Since this topic was not discussed before during any other international meetings or any other international forum. This is an absolutely new issue And we did not fully understand what lies behind this topic After some of the statements that we heard today made by other delegations, we have an approximate understanding of what we're talking about here However, it still remains unclear to us What do you mean using the term systems requiring protection Those delegations that  spoke to this issues, they're the ones that are very sensitive about the terminology and clarity of terminology being employed here in this form. But perhaps then they can give us a definition of such systems. We believe that this topic in light of the arguments that were presented earlier. Has A very loose link with the whole issue of preventing an arms race in outer space, something that we're discussing here. Rather, it can be linked to the issue of the safety of space activities And the main platform we're discussing those issues is Copas Or at least the 4th committee of the young General Assembly. But it's not a subject being discussed by the 1st committee Or in any of the forum discussing issues related to Paris. We believe That To start, it would be very useful to discuss this issue in Copus Before Bringing this issue for discussion here in this working group. Where in one way or another we find that the level of expertise is not good enough for discussing this issue, here this specific issue a very new issue for our expert community. Moreover, such notions as systems that require specific forms of protection or defense Were linked by some delegations, for example by the delegation of Switzerland, Were linked directly to the question of the applicability of international humanitarian law to outer space In light of the diameter of the opposite views on that issue That exist here amongst allegations. It would be hardly advisable to have this issue as a separate topic.",4
S3M777,3,7,France,"Mercy, Mr. President. Thank you, Chair. I'd like to make a few remarks in reaction to the very interesting discussion we're having here today for France. This is a very interesting topic. This is a very relevant issue for our group and it is very important for us to think about critical activities that are very important for the safety of goods and Persons that depend on space activities. This is why any discussion of this issue does make sense and also link to link it up to Discussion of the previous topic, in any case the identification of Goods and services that are critical for activities on Earth, Although this work should not be Considered by default as Any targeting of space systems that have not been identified as providing essential services to the population. Some countries Do not discriminate between Critical or essential systems and other space systems. So it is necessary for us to focus our discussions that are essential to the well-being of populations and activities on the ground and not simply related to the safety of objects. Now also perturbing the activities of certain satellites that are not identified as providing critical services to the population can also have an impact on the same very same satellites because we Cannot always manage the impact that Ill spirited activities may have on Satellites, Now, to summarize this discussion, should not be considered as something that authorizes hostile Acts against space Objects that are not considered to follow within this category. So that is my comment.",0
