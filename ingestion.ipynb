Kindly take your seats, please.It is my honor and pleasure to declare open the second session of the open-ended working group on reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors. But before we proceed with our agenda, I would like to express to the governments of the United Kingdom, of Great Britain and Northern Islands, and of the Commonwealth realms my heartfelt condolences on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. In this regard, I would like to request delegations to observe a minute of silence in her honor. Before clarifying the organizational aspects and proceedings with our substantive work, please allow me to make some preliminary remarks in my capacity as Chair of the OEWG. This I will do in Spanish. Distinguished colleagues. First and foremost, let me say how happy I am. that we have once again been able to meet here as part of the open-ended working group on reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors. During this session, we are going to be tackling future and current threats that states face, as well as all those emissions and activities which could be considered irresponsible.It is a difficult but necessary discussion that we need to have in order to make progress with this process and in order to be able to fulfill our mandate. The outcome of this â€“ from the outcome of this session will in large part depend being able to tackle further discussion on possible recommendations to face these threats. Distinguished colleagues, I am very well aware of the complex international context. It is a process which is not happening in a vacuum. that we are not immune to the global political situation. Nevertheless, with the active and constructive participation of all delegations, I am certain that we will be able to make progress in our discussions. At the beginning of the first session, which was held in May, we also had a very difficult global scenario and we had to listen to very many persons expressing doubts meeting. Nevertheless, we were able to have an interesting and constructive discussion at that time. This was partly thanks to the excellent level of the panelists, but what was even more important was the positive attitude of delegations. I hope that in this second session during which we will tackle even more complex and sensitive issues, we will similarly be able to keep the same constructive spirit and the wider and the rearranging participation of all delegations. If this condition is not met, then we will simply have no possibility of making any progress with our task. Contrary to the first session, on this occasion, I have not been able to carry out many preliminary consultations. The main reason is that the majority of delegations were, in fact, involved in the important NPT review conference. In this respect, I wish to say that the frustrating result of that conference should not have an impact on our work here because this second session is in fact the continuation of our first session held last May. I also hope this because with the cooperation of everyone, we will be able to maintain the positive spirit of this process. I seized the opportunity to share with all delegations the fact that I had the opportunity of taking part in a regional seminar in Santiago in Chile organized by the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs together with UNIDIR and the Secure World Foundation. This was a very fruitful meeting which allowed us to take this process further in the Latin American and Caribbean region and to become better acquainted with the uncertainties of countries or the concerns of those countries. I briefly wish to refer to the participation of delegations of non-government bodies. In this respect, I wish to reiterate the importance of contributions that these delegations can make, but I also seize this opportunity to highlight the fact that this is a process which is being led by states. We have abided very closely by what is laid out in Resolution 76.231, and we will continue to give representatives of non-governmental bodies the possibility of intervening after official delegations in an informal mode. This was the proceeding which was used in the first session. It was proved satisfactory for all and we will continue to use it in this second session. I also seize this opportunity to emphasize the importance of us bearing in mind the real sense of urgency posed by space threats and the obligation that we have to find effective solutions which must of course consider our national interests and objectives must transcend them despite the fact that they are legitimate. I conclude these brief introductory words by reiterating my appeal to all delegations to participate actively and constructively and I would add creatively. and appeal to them to focus on the issues that we must tackle during this session. We must make progress in our work in order to meet our common objective, which is to improve the safety and security of all our citizens. Thank you. Distinguished Delegates, Excellencies, as you know, this group is established pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 76-231 entitled Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules, and Principles of Responsible Behaviors, which provides the mandate of our work. You will recall that in accordance with operative paragraph 6 of resolution 66231, an organizational session of the OEWG was held in Geneva on 7th and 9th February 2022, at which we reached agreement on a number of issues. In particular, the group adopted its agenda as now contained in document A-AC294-2022-2. The group affirmed the applicability mutatis mutandis of the rules of procedure of the United Nations General Assembly to this body and that all decisions by the group shall be taken on the basis of consensus by the United Nations member states. The group affirmed that other international organizations, commercial actors and civil society as referred to in paragraph 6 of resolution 76.231 will be able to attend the public plenary and may provide written contributions on matters under consideration by the group, which will be made available at no cost to the organization. Pursuant to the established practice, the Chair undertook to provide the group with a list of the entities with consultative status with the Economic and Social Council for information and a list of all other relevant organizations and commercial actors for consideration on a no-objection basis. These lists are now available at the back of the conference room. This week is the second session of the OEWG. I would like to remind delegations that unless the working group decides otherwise, the dates of the remaining sessions are as follows. The third session will take place from 30th of January to 3rd of February 2023, and the fourth session will take place from 7th to 11th of August 2023. Let's now turn to the organization of the work of this week's second session of the OEWG. Following the practice of the first session, I would now like to draw your attention to the indicative timetable of the second session, which was circulated by the Secretariat on the 1st of September with the symbol A slash AC 294 slash 2022 slash Inf2 slash Rev1. I would like to remind you that the Indicative Timetable is not a formal program of work, but a flexible tool to facilitate delegations' preparations for the meeting and to encourage a well-structured interactive dialogue. Our work this week will focus on Agenda Item 6b. to consider current and future threats by states to space systems and actions, activities and omissions that could be considered irresponsible. During each morning session, I have organized informal panels that will address a specific topic under agenda item 6b. Please note that, given the requirements to provide simultaneous interpretation for the informal panels, the length of the morning session will be limited to two hours. However, the afternoon sessions, which will be dedicated to the general exchange among member states on each topic, will last for three hours. delegates. Finally, before we begin with the substantive work of the day, I would like to bring to your attention one additional organizational aspect. As you recall, pursuant to resolution 76.231, the OEWG shall work with the attendance of other international organizations, commercial actors, and civil society representatives in accordance with established practice. Following the practice of the first session, as I already mentioned, commercial actors and civil society to request the floor and make oral statements in an informal setting at the end of our formal discussion on each topic, time permitting and on a non-objection basis. I would now like to begin our work under agenda item 6b, which is to consider current and future threats by states to space systems and actions, activities, and emissions that could be considered irresponsible. This morning we will begin the discussion with an informal panel and discussion on topic 1, nature and uses of the outer space environment and space systems in relation to current and future threats by states to space systems. The panel will feature Dr. Kazuto Suzuki of the University of Tokyo, Mr. James Black of RAND Europe, Dr. Youyou Wang of the Beijing Institute of Technology, and Mr. Clinton Clark of Exxon Analytic. The first panelist today is Dr. Kazuto Suzuki, Professor, Graduate School of Public Policy of the University of Tokyo. Dr. Suzuki, you have the floor.\n",
