      "Transcribed: 00:11:57: Representative of China for a statement. And now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of India. You have the floor, Sir.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:05: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for giving my delegation the floor once again. Under this agenda item, we have carefully listened to the statements made by other delegations on the topic. In that background, I'd like to briefly present our priorities, which are focused on the challenges to safety and sustainability that arise in the context of Space Flight, especially while operating in the presence of increasing number of outer space objects.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:31: In recent times, Cube Sats and Nano Sats have emerged as preferred options for affordable access to space and their deployment typically takes place through rideshare and in batches. Due to their small size, they are often difficult to track as well as to be identified immediately after injection. Such satellites usually lack maneuverability and hence the onus of collision avoidance falls single handedly on the owner come operators of maneuverable satellites.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:12:58: In most cases of on orbit conjunctions with small satellites, the lack of information to contact spacecraft operators proves to be a major challenge to initiate the requisite coordination and data exchange for collision risk mitigation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:13: Also, unlike space debris, which are non maneuverable objects, the trajectory of maneuverable spacecraft, especially those equipped with iron thrusters, cannot be predicted by the straightforward application of conventional flight dynamics.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:28: The present mode of interoperator coordination is primarily through exchange of emails, which leads to considerable latency due to time zone differences given the phenomenal growth in the number of operational satellites contacting the operators individually to resolve close approach situations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:44: On a case by case basis will prove to be challenging in the long run.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:13:49: Also, the anticipated increase in collision avoidance maneuvers will incur significant penalties in terms of service disruption, fuel consumption, additional operational overhead, and associated costs. This added complexity would be difficult to be borne by emergent space actors. Further, the operators often utilize higher accuracy orbital data of their own space assets and relatively less accurate externally accessible orbital data of the foreign objects to assess the collision risks.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:18: Furthermore, different operators adopt different methodologies for risk estimation and also apply different criteria for identifying critical conjunctions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:28: In the absence of a standardized method of risk assessment and a common protocol for collision avoidance, any decision to conduct an invasive maneuver to mitigate a close approach risk essentially hinges on the discretion of the operator.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:42: We believe that any discussion on reducing space threats should also incorporate elements described above.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:14:48: The risks and threats they pose and the Ways and Means to address those challenges. We understand that discussions on these elements are underway in UN Corpus, in particular the Working Group on the Long Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities. Considering the holistic nature of threats that we face relating to outer space safety and security, there also needs to be a greater coordination between the work done here and the working group on the LTS in the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee in the UN Corpus and in particular the coordination between the UN Office of Outer Space Affairs.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:15:20: The UN Office of Disarmament Affairs. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:15:25: I thank the distinguished representative of India for his statement, and now I would like to give the photo to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:15:36: Possible. Thank you, distinguished Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:15:41: The topic 8IN many ways intersects with topic seven, since we're talking about also.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:15:51: About knowledge sharing, information exchange and exchange of information in the form of different forms of notifications that can mitigate danger, mitigate threat.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:16:09: With respect to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:16:11: This information exchange.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:16:16: We briefly will probably repeat the arguments that we set out yesterday with respect to topic 7, because they do rather overlap and relate not simply to information exchange on space doctrine and activities, but also it's relevant with respect to information exchange in the field of risk reduction.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:16:46: Russia believes that full-fledged information exchange on various aspects of outer space policy.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:17:12: Or not same voluntary basis in various international and regional forum?\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:21: And an interesting example here is the UN, the UN Committee on Outer Space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:31: It's legal and scientific, scientific, technical subcommittees.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:37: Also this information exchange.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:42: Can be carried out on a voluntary basis without any problems.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:17:53: And the Disarmament Commission.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:17:56: But what's most important is bilaterally, as I said, since we already have a politically binding recommendations which effectively.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:18:09: Were harmonized principles with respect to the need for that kind of exchange on a voluntary basis.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:28:39: For such exchange of information, exchange of notifications and exchange of information in the context of conducting consultations between states, that proposal remains on the table.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:28:55: Within the UNUN Space Committee.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:29:23: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement, and now I would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of Canada for his reaction.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:29:38: Chair and good morning to everyone. I wanted to briefly make a comment on what the last speaker said, because I thought that the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation made an excellent case for why we need norms related to information exchange and notifications relevant to consultative mechanisms. Indeed, he quite correctly pointed out that there's a consultation mechanism under Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty. However, it's difficult, if not impossible for states to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:30:08: Exercise that right without information about the space activities of other states. So for example if some activity.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:30:14: We're going to be conducted that could perhaps produce long lasting debris. By providing information about the nature of that kind of activity, it would empower State parties to then exercise the right under Article 9 to seek consultations. Of course, this doesn't diminish or eliminate the obligation upon States to proactively consult if they believe that their activities could cause potentially harmful interference with the space activities of other states parties. However, providing such additional information and notifications simply helps us to apply the existing legally binding norms that we find in the Outer Space Treaty. So I think, as I said, an excellent case was made there For more information exchange in order to empower us to use the existing consultation mechanisms. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:00: I thank the distinguished representative of Canada for his statement and give the floor to the distinguished representative of China.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:14: Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:17: Dear colleagues, good morning.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:21: Regarding.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:23: Topic seven and eight China would like to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:29: Make express some views on the legal alignment or coherence the Chinese delegation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:39: As the following statement involves some legal provisions, I was speaking English.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:31:48: My delegation just expressed the view that to keep consistent with lex, lata should be served as one of the guiding principles when we consid.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:00: Drafting norms, rules, principles for the rule of law is basically created domain.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:11: And now I would like to talk give 2 examples to show the Nexus between the existing legal system and our work.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:21: Respectively Article 11 and Article 9.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:27: Of the Auspice Treaty, which just were discussed, raised by my colleagues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:33: So first, regarding Article 11, it's very relevant, as you know, to our discussion.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:42: TCB app.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:46: So just to better to show the case, to show the challenges to us, just allow me to read it out.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:32:56: I I suppose all of you are familiar with it.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:33:01: So I just from.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:33:07: State parties agreed to inform the Secretary General of the United Nations, as well as the public and international scientific community.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:33:19: To the greatest extent feasible and practicable.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:33:23: Of the natural conduct, locations and resources of such activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:33:29: So my point is that we have to consider about the specific wording here. It used the term agreed to rather than shall assume.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:33:40: And also it emphasizes the term to the greatest extent, feasible and practicable. So my delegation is very happy to see some norms in this regard proposed by our dear colleagues we just suggest.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:00: Such kind of consistency should be seriously considered.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:06: So that's the first point. The relevant expression could be found as well in the TCVM report when talking about notification regarding the risks risks reduction.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:21: And some other matters.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:23: And the second point is about Article 9, just as our Russian colleague mentioned that it's just set up the consultative mechanism from legal perspective.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:36: And I heard that some delegation just mentioned that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:41: The affected The potentially affected state has the right.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:46: For a consultation, it is correct but not 100% correct.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:34:52: The potential affected state is not the only one who has who is eligible.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:35:00: To raise a consultation request.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:35:03: So if we just read Article 9 carefully, it said that birthday party to the treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another city party, outer space, including the moon and other social bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities but without mentioning its own activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:35:29: So this can just show the significance to discover.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:35:36: The true meaning in lex lata.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:35:39: To keep consistency with the legal principles set up in the existing of space treaty and besides as to back to Article 11, whether it set up a notification obligation is still in question in space lock community. Someone just argue that it's a notification mechanism considering it used the term agreed to and considering the saying to the greatest extent feasible and practicable. So that's why my delegation from very beginning.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:36:12: Suggested that we should do the serious interpretation of the existing legal terms, legal principles and of course, as well as while drafting the relevant rules, I thank you, Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:36:31: I thank the distinguished representative of China for his statement, and now I would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:36:44: Thank you very much, distinguished Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:36:49: I would like to react.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:36:52: As part of our interactive discussion, I would like to react to the comments made by the sinks representative of Canada.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:01: First I would like to point out.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:08: That information exchanges that distinguished Representative Canada referred to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:19: An exchange that is necessary for the launching of any consultative mechanism.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:27: As we said, well, this is something that has already been done on a voluntary basis.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:33: And all the necessary conditions have been created to facilitate such exchanges, moreover.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:41: Countries have their own possibilities to obtain relevant information related to space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:49: And this is something that we all know about and.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:37:55: We heard about this during the discussions in this working group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:38:02: And This is why the adoption of any other politically binding legal norms and that respect will simply not change the situation, because politically binding norms may only cover voluntary information exchanges, the provision of notifications purely on a voluntary basis.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:38:28: Because by nature, politically binding norms are not intrusive and not legally binding.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:38:38: They are voluntary.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:38:48: This is why.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:38:53: As far as the conservative mechanism is concerned, if we talk about politically binding norms related to information exchange, such norms will not change anything in terms of the situation that we have today, We already have all these norms and standards and.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:39:10: Such information exchanges are already being carried out.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:39:15: At least we're not aware of any problems that are related to such information exchanges, and we haven't heard anything said about any problems that may exist during our discussions yesterday and today.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:39:31: Now, as far as as far as the consultant mechanism that is provided for by Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty is concerned.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:39:41: That mechanism can be used by any country, including Canada, and you can do that today if Canada.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:39:52: Believes that some form of space activity is being carried out in violation of the provisions and agreements under international law.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:06: In that case, any delegation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:11: Any UN member state, state, party to the Outer Space Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:17: Can send a relevant complaint or request to the depository countries of.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:24: That Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:27: With an appeal to convene a consultative meeting to discuss different concerns questions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:35: And complaints that such a country may have.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:41: Once again, there are no obstacles to doing just that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:49: We can understand.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:40:53: The fact that this question related to information exchanges and the consultative mechanism, we can understand that this question is being raised, but only in one scenario.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:41:07: When we are talking about specific, legally binding intrusive norms.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:41:16: Related to the implementation or carrying out of such information exchanges.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:41:20: Or if this relates to an exchange of notifications.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:41:25: And if this relates to the creation of a specific format for holding consultations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:41:34: That would be functioning on a permanent basis.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:41:40: In connection with the specific objectives of a specific, legally binding agreement.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:41:49: But having said that, we would also like to say that such a legally binding agreement should provide for.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:42:01: Some other specific mandatory.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:42:07: Elements that would ensure the normal functioning and implementation of that agreement.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:42:16: Because it would provide for in light of its legally binding nature, it provide for direct international accountability of Member States. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:42:30: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement, and I would like to go give the four to the distinguished representative of Brazil, and before we do, we we give him the floor I I would like to kindly request.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:42:46: Delegations to Keep in mind that we still have a few topics that we need to address today.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:42:54: So as not to extend too much the discussion on under this topic, I know this is very interesting and and intense lively and interactive debate which I appreciate very much as everybody else. But we need to keep in mind that we have a lot of other topics that we we that are also very important that are are fundamental in in this week's session.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:43:21: That said, I give the four to the distinguished representative of Brazil.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:43:30: Chairman, I'll try to keep my comments short and sweet. It's a prepared statement, so I don't expect it to take too much time. And I certainly support your perception that we need to get onto the rest of the very interesting topics in our in our agenda on this specific topic. On risk reduction notifications, the GG on TCBMS also sets important guidelines In its paragraphs 42 to 45. There is a series of recommendations on the notification of.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:44:00: Programmed maneuvers that may pose a risk to the security, to the safety of objects in orbit.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:44:06: Notification and monitoring of high risk uncontrolled reentry events. Notification in case of emergency and in case of intentional orbital separation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:44:16: The implementation of these recommendations with a view to safeguarding space security can be the subject of in-depth debate in debating this OWG.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:44:25: In our view in its report, the group could identify gaps in the reporting system and suggest concrete improvements. In doing so. It should take into account the already existing structure and the rules of the Registration Convention and the recommendations of the long term Sustainability Guidelines, the LTS notably Guidelines B4 which is to perform conjunction assessments during all orbital phases of controlled fight and B5 to develop practical approaches for pre launched conjunction assessments.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:44:57: With regard to the topic of consultative mechanisms, my delegation recalls Article 9 of the OST, which establishes the obligation of States to carry out appropriate international consultations before activities that could cause harmful interference to activities of other States parties in their peaceful exploration of outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:45:19: In addition to supporting the obligation of due diligence, due regard in space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:45:27: Obligation of prior consultation aims at avoiding misinterpretations of space activities and experiments. The GG on TCBMS also elaborated on these issues on its paragraphs 57 to 59.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:45:41: From the point of view of furthering responsible behaviour, this group could recommend the establishment of consultation mechanisms with a view to fostering transparency about specific activities and avoiding this information, misinformation and distrust.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:45:57: In this regard, it is the view of our delegation that the OEWG should address the issue of regular institutional dialogue on space security within the UN. Existing 4 have limitations in this regard. COPIOS, for instance, has a mandate that limits its purview to issues related to peaceful uses. The Conference on Disarmament on its turn is limited to negotiating possible multilateral instruments on Paris. It is their necessary, therefore, to consider what would be the appropriate forum for following up on any recommendations of this OEWG.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:46:33: Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:46:35: I thank the distinguished representative of Brazil for his assent statement and give the floor to the distinguished representative of Norway.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:46:50: Thank you, Chair. We welcome these topics on information exchange and notifications. Transparency is a fundamental principle in the domain of peace and security, and something we routinely insist on, and for good reason, of course. Transparency on strategies, policies, doctrines, capabilities, and activities enable us to understand one another's plans and intentions, and it facilitates dialogue and concerns one might have with the stated plans and intentions of others. It helps build trust and confidence. It helps reduce risks of misconceptions and misunderstandings. And health tends to reduce the risk of erroneous threat perceptions and escalation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:47:25: And the same applies to transparency in the form of pre launch notifications, advanced notice on on orbit operations, debris creation or other events that have or could easily be perceived to have an impact on the interests of others and indeed the topics of information exchange.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:47:42: Are addressed in other forums. So why should we here as an OEWG, affirm the importance of such transparency measures and proposed concrete normative formulations to that effect? And for us, the reason is simple. We we should do so because we have the mandate to look at space through a security lens.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:47:56: To assess ways to reduce space threats through norms, rules and principles and transparency and confidence building measures contribute to the same. And the fact that other bodies have concluded that transparency is useful for the mandates and purposes that they serve does not diminish the value of this OEWG affirming its relevance in the context of space security and in terms of concrete recommendations we agree with. I think it was India yesterday that indicated that we need not reinvent the wheel, and where appropriate rules, norms and principles have been developed elsewhere. We can endorse and promote those.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:48:29: The added value is that we do so from a perspective of threat reduction in space security and explain why implementation of those norms would reduce threat perceptions, tensions and increase space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:48:40: Regarding the norms that we could propose in this OEWG, we think many of the suggestions that have been made today and yesterday merit consideration. To name a few, we would support the proposition that states should make publicly available information on their space policies, doctrines and strategies. That states should publish notifications about planned space activities that could impact on the operations of others. That state should provide timely pre launch notification in accordance with The Hague Code of Conduct.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:49:07: The state should establish national points of contact for information exchange and space related activities. And finally on the topic of consultative mechanism, the Ad space treat. Article 9 of course provides for such consultations, but it's silent on the formats and mechanisms as such. So that is something that this OWG can contribute to flesh out. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:49:27: I thank the distinguished representative of Norway for his statement. And now I give floor to the distinguished representative of Canada. You have the floor.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:49:38: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll try to be brief. It is correct, as some delegations have pointed out, that any state may exercise the right to seek consultations under Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty at any time. However, as we explained, it can be difficult or impossible to exercise this right without further information, and as we have a wonderful interactive dialogue going on here, this is fantastic, but sometimes it helps to use a specific example to illustrate the point so we can do so now.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:50:07: For example.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:50:09: 21 When the Russian Federation conducted the destructive direct descent anti satellite missile test, it would have been very useful for states, Canada, all states to have received advanced information and notification about this, as well as further information on the nature of it, so that those states could have assessed the need to seek consultations, Canada or any other state. So indeed developing norms about these information exchange mechanisms in order to empower consultative mechanisms.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:50:41: Is useful because it allows states to actually exercise that right. Without that information, there's no way in every case of knowing whether you should want to seek consultations. Of course, explanations and information can be provided after the event, but at that point there's a certain amount of, perhaps distrust, that's been created by the lack of notification information, and any explanations can sometimes be viewed with some skepticism and mistrust. Therefore, it is a best practice.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:51:10: A norm of responsible behavior, one might say, to provide information beforehand to ensure that that mistrust isn't bred beforehand and that we have the opportunity to clarify things before they can escalate into misunderstandings and perhaps disputes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:51:29: I thank the distinguished representative of Canada for his brief reaction. We have.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:51:36: Three more speakers and I would like to wrap up this discussion on this topic with these three so that we don't continue because we, we, we it is, I know it's fascinating and we could continue another week discussing this, but but we need to move on. So I would like to give the photo the distinguished representative of Austria.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:52:00: We will have another statement that will also touch on the issues that we are currently discussing on a later stage today on another topic. But it will also cover many of the elements that are currently under discussion. And we wanted to share just some remarks in the same direction on on this interactive debate which will come to a close very soon. So we we are pressed to to to expand on them in our view.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:52:25: What we should do, is it indeed strengthening the existing mechanisms that we have, those in the Outer Space Treaty, but also, as some have remarked, the Registration Convention.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:52:34: And when it comes to Article 9 or even Article 11 of the Outer Space Treaty that already exists, we have to say that they come from a different area of space faring. They come from from a time when when the space was in a different situation politically, strategically, but there was also in general more space, one could say. And we have a very different situation right now with new space faring actors, which are not necessarily states but also in general.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:53:04: More important, more more dense situation. So what we need to do and what is our view about those existing instruments is that we should should strengthen them by operation, operationalizing them, and this could be one of the task and one of the outcomes of our work here.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:53:21: To give more guidance to states on how they should be used to implement STEM, how to implement them in a better way.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:53:30: Setting up norms in that regard give legal clarification.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:53:35: And also strengthen them by setting up mechanisms.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:53:39: On how they could be used, and this is especially true when it comes to consultations on the Article 9 and on a harmful interference, because, as many experts has have already expressed, expressed in our previous two sessions, it is not completely clear on how states should move forward on them.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:53:56: And as we just heard on a very excellent intervention from our Indian colleague, there are not the structures, the mechanisms or even the proper e-mail addresses to do that when it comes to a dangerous situation. And this is just our few remarks on the interactive debate, maybe as a last point, sorry.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:54:16: Overall, sharing information is in the interest of all. It is, of course, in the interest of the major spacefaring nations who have significant capabilities up there, but it is in the very interest.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:54:28: Of new and emerging spacefaring nations. So we don't really understand what is the restrictive approach to sharing information and trust and confidence building in this room. I'm sorry. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:54:41: I thank the distinguished representative of Austria, and now I will give the vote to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:54:53: Thank you very much, distinguished Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:54:59: First of all, would like to react to what was just said by the distinguished representative of Austria.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:55:11: Mostly about the outdated nature of the Outer Space Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:55:19: This is quite a dangerous idea.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:55:25: And it's simply reaffirms our concerns.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:55:31: Related to any attempts to review existing legally binding norms of international law that apply to outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:55:41: We do not share this point of view.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:55:45: We believe that the Outer Space Treaty is relevant, it's very effective and applicable.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:55:56: It is one of the fundamental international acts that regulate space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:56:09: Now on the need to clarify certain norms contained in the Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:56:18: We would like to once again like to say that we do not understand this dichotomy in the presentations that are being made by representatives of Western states. In other words, they say that some norms require clarification, they need further work, and other norms do not require any additional clarification, and it is enough to have the norms that we already have, as reflected.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:56:47: In international agreements like article two of the UN Charter.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:56:53: So we failed to understand that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:00: But if we take that point of view into consideration.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:06: We can say that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:12: The lack of any detailed clarifications.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:17: In the very sources of international law, for example the Outer Space Treaty and Article 9 related to the organization of consultations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:31: And here I will now refer to the statement that was made by the distinguished representative of Canada.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:39: States, Parties to this Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:45: Face no obstacles in launching this process.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:51: And we have examples from other international for the most recent example.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:57:58: Relates to how the Russian Federation invoked such a procedure in the BWC in September of last year.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:10: When the consultative mechanism provided for by the BWC was invoked and the specific procedures are spelled out related to the organization of such consultations of such a consultative meeting.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:27: And yes, this mechanism was launched and we believe that it was done from a technical point of view very effectively.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:38: Those consultations were organized. They were held.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:44: There are certain level of exchange views.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:58:48: There was quite a lot of states that participated in that meeting and a final report of the meeting was adopted after the conclusion of those consultations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:01: So what prevents us to do the same in line with Article 9 of the Outer Space Treaty? We do not see any problems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:11: That, if necessary, such consultations can indeed be organized.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:17: And as one of the depositary states of the Outer Space Treaty, we reaffirm.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:24: Readiness.\n",

      "Transcribed: 00:59:31: To organize such an event if necessary.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:35: I think we will be supported in this by other depository states of the Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:42: Moreover.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:46: On the provision of information.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:50: That.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:51: Would be the reason for holding such consultations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 00:59:57: I'll briefly repeat.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:00: And say that if we are talking about purely politically binding rules, principles, standards.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:13: Then we will not be in a position to force any country to provide such information.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:21: All of that information will still be provided on a voluntary basis.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:28: Therefore, if we really.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:33: Want to have states provide such information?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:38: In a mandatory binding manner.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:43: We.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:00:46: Will determine the scope of the information that should be provided in order to ensure that it is in line with the criteria related to the launching of a consultative mechanism. Take into account the views of all delegations. Well, in that case, what we need to have is.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:06: Legally binding standards. In that case, states will be obliged to provide.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:14: Relevant information by a certain date or in specific situations. As you said before, certain types of space activities are carried out, but for that we need legally binding standards.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:30: Otherwise.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:32: We will not be able to force any country to provide information.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:40: Because such norms will be voluntary, even if politically binding, but still voluntary, and any country would have the possibility either to provide such information.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:01:55: In the scope that it finds necessary and when it finds it necessary or it can simply not provide any information at all if it finds that to be excessive and that it is not really required.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:11: And on the basis of politically binding norms, no state can be forced.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:19: To submit such information. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:25: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement. We will move to topic 9, but before we do so, we will give the four to the last two speakers. On this topic, the distinguished representative of France has the floor.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:45: Thank you very much.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:52: I have two comments to make on this subject.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:58: 1st.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:02:59: The need to take duly take into account the interests of other states due regard and also the mechanisms related to consultative mechanism now on due regard.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:11: I will not go back to the origins of that concept for France. It is not up to this working group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:21: On the basis of the Outer Space Treaty, to have more restrictive interpretation of what due regard of interests of other States means.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:32: We.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:35: Do not have a top down approach here. Should not have but we should have.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:42: Upwards approach in this work and the objective of this group is to establish norms of responsible.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:49: Behavior that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:03:52: Respond to threats from or to space generated by irresponsible behavior. So by establishing such sets of norms in response to identified traits that we actually implement Article 9 and we have due regard of the interests of states.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:13: Related to threats from or to space. Now the operation of such norms of responsible behavior is actually.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:22: It relates to the full implementation of Article 9. This is how it lives. Now I'd like to make some remarks on the consultative mechanism and the exchange of information that were subject to this very interesting discussion this morning. Some states are saying that it is not. There's no need to have such a consultative mechanism.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:44: But, and I would like to refer to what was said by Norway and Brazil on this subject, it is indeed useful to do that because the implementation of transparency and confidence building measures that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:04:56: Were identified in 2018 report or not?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:02: Really being implemented because the establishment of contact points, the list of contact points is not really implemented. We don't have the addresses or telephone numbers.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:14: To talk about space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:18: And also I would say that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:22: The information and exchange information.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:27: Only.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:29: Happens. Or rather, it said that it only happens in emergency situations, and that was what was said in the room here. When we have an extraordinary situation, an emergency, that's when we exchange information. But when we exchange information, we really must keep in mind that this should be done in an ongoing matter, not necessarily referring to emergency and trust is not simply.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:05:54: Based on a treaty, something that creates overtime through dialogue, and This is why we would need to have such a consultative mechanism, not just to implement measures of transparency and confidence building, but also to build trust, the trust necessary.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:13: To ensure the robustness of any potential legally binding instruments in the future, and This is why we need such a consultative mechanism and we believe it is really crucial to create such a mechanism. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:27: I thank the distinguished representative of France, and now we have the last speaker under this item. It will be the the brief statement by the distinguished representative of the United States.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:06:41: Very quickly, you know, key aspect of the exchange we've been having here is that the provisions of the Outer Space Treaty like Article 9 apply to the states parties to the treaty. There are countries in this room that are launching satellites into space that are not members of the Outer Space Treaty. So that does not give them the ability to invoke Article 9 if they have questions or concerns. Or for states parties to the treaties to invoke Article 9 with those states. And so perhaps voluntary TCBMS such as contained in the 2013 GGE report are ones that this body develops would be useful to enhancing transparency with all countries. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:19: I thank the distinguished representative of the United States. With this, we wrap up the discussion of Topic 8 and move on to discuss Topic 9, norms, rules and principles relating to international cooperation, including with respect to space surveillance and tracking, and space situational awareness.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:38: The floor is now open.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:40: For any delegation that wishes to intervene.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:43: Under this topic.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:47: United Kingdom I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:07:58: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, as we develop new norms, rules and principles to address threats to space systems, it is important that we consider how their implementation can be monitored, compliance verified and non compliance identified and attributed. If States are to abide by new norms, they will want to be assured that others are doing the same.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:20: It is therefore essential that the international community devise ways of gathering and sharing reliable and credible space situational awareness data which States can trust.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:30: The distance of many satellites from Earth and the dual use nature of many space technologies presents a significant challenge for accurately understanding and characterising space objects and activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:08:41: Only a few states possess capabilities such as telescopes, radars on orbit, inspector satellites, and analytical tools that allow for a high degree of space situational awareness. Even with these capabilities, there are limits to the ability to determine the nature of objects when in orbit or their intended purpose.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:01: That is why the focus on behaviours is so important. Behaviours can be observed. It's easier to observe how a system is being operated than it is to determine the nature or intended purpose of the system.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:14: Space situational awareness can give states more confidence in identifying and attributing the activities, actions, and emissions of other states, and to provide more objective basis for addressing any concerns that arise from these behaviors.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:28: As states continue to acquire and or access space situational awareness capabilities and data, whether from commercial space situational awareness or sovereign systems, they should endeavour to share this information widely and also participate in efforts designed to improve the reliability of data created from the various sources, all of which use different algorithms and analytical software to arrive at their analysis.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:09:54: The UK supports the ongoing discussions on space data and information sharing, including those occurring at the International Standards Organization and which may lead to the establishment of standards that would support effective verification and compliance analysis in future.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:10: That concludes our remarks on topic 9. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:14: I thank the distinguished representatives of the United Kingdom for his statement and give the floor to the distinguished ambassador of Japan. You have the floor, ambassador.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:24: Representative Yes.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:29: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Sorry, I I will make a statement.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:33: So let me explain and share Japan's draft recommendations on this topic.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:38: Improving assessing capabilities in each country will help build build transparency across activities in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:10:47: More detailed information about the behavior in space could be obtained, which could also contribute to attribution. For this reason, you'd like to present direct recommendations for related capacity building.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:01: States should promote international cooperation to endure and enhance stable use of outdoor space through capacity building, including showing SSA information. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:14: I thank the distinguished representative of Japan for the statement and give the floor to the distinguished representative of Switzerland.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:26: Mercy, Mr. President. Thank you, Chairman.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:30: Regarding topic nine, we have a couple of brief remarks to make. Switzerland believes that the capacity building of knowledge of the space in of the space situational awareness.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:43: Should is of particular importance to avoid misunderstandings. It's important for states to work together to strengthen compatibility and interoperability of the various systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:11:56: So we support exchange of data and sharing of space surveillance catalogues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:02: With free access, the development of a reference catalogue should also allow us to identify, in a uniform fashion, activities not consistent with the responsible conduct principles. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:18: I thank the distinguished representative of Switzerland for his statement and give the floor to the distinguished representative of India.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:31: Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:34: I take the floor to express my delegations perspective on this topic, norms, rules and principles relating to international cooperation, including with respect to space surveillance and space situational awareness.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:12:48: First of all, let me reiterate that India strongly advocates peaceful uses of outer space and recognizes that space is a global common to be utilized for the benefits of all humankind.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:02: India is opposed to weaponization of the outer space and has not resorted to any arm space in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:09: India has been an active proponent of international cooperation in the domain of outer space, with a space program firmly rooted in peaceful applications aimed at extending the benefits of space based services for enrichment of life of the common man.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:26: In this regard, and echoing some of the remarks made by delegations before us under this topic, India recognizes that space situational awareness is an integral part of safe and sustainable operations in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:41: Efforts are underway to set up space object observational facilities in India comprising of radars and optical telescopes.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:13:49: A dedicated ISRO system for Space and Sustainable Space Operations Management, which we have abbreviated as IS 4 OM, has been established to collate all space situational awareness efforts in India and to act as a hub for the relevant data exchanges and collaborations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:10: This is with the objective of ensuring that India and its outer space capabilities, the activities themselves, are conducted in a safe, sustainable and responsible manner.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:22: With the project on Network for Space object tracking and Analysis acronymed as NITRA.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:29: India has channelized its efforts in space situational awareness and has also joined the international efforts towards tracking, warning and mitigating space debris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:41: The observational and computational capabilities for space objects tracking and management are being enhanced under the scope of Project Netra.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:50: India has been making efforts for raising awareness on SSA matters.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:14:55: An International Workshop on Space Situational Awareness and Space Traffic Management was organized by India in January 2023, which focused on the challenges posed by space debris and deliberated on the methods, procedures, technologies and policies for preserving the security and safety of outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:19: Mr. Chair, in the context of space situational awareness and space surveillance, India encourages collaboration and information exchange among the Member States in cognizance of the fact that cooperation and transparency is key to ensure safe and sustainable operations in space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:37: With regard to discussions on norms, rules and principles for reducing space threats, permit me to briefly reiterate our views.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:46: Subjectivity in the interpretation of space behaviors and perception of threats, how they are understood and the application of such determinations continues to be a matter of concern to us.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:15:58: Let me refer to the report of the GE on TCBMS in 2013, in particular its para 34, which defines the criteria for transparency and confidence building measure.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:10: Any proposed TCBMS must be clear, practical and proven, and they should be effectively confirmed by other parties in its application.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:19: In this regard, we have concerns about who and on what basis will the assessments be made on the responsibility of space operations and lack thereof, a point which we have made earlier to.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:32: We have concerns about the verification of space behavior using current technology and the access to such technology.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:40: The means for an unbiased assessment of a space behavior that are accepted and understood by all uniformly and that are immune to politicization are a related matter of concern.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:16:51: We feel that the essence of testing a TCBM for its implementation and validation, as provided in para 35 of the 2013 TCBM GG Report, must be preserved in consideration of any new norms, rules and principles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:08: In the context of challenges associated with verification.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:12: We suggest that there could be some merit in further exploring the feasibility of developing a global or intergovernmental basis for independent SSA capabilities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:23: Let me conclude, Mr. Chair, by saying that India attaches importance to safety, security and sustainability of outer space activities and is committed to playing a responsible role in the international efforts towards preserving benefits of outer space for the future generations. I thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:41: I thank the distinguished representative of India for his statement, and now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:17:52: Thank you, Mr. Chair. the United States steadfastly supports international cooperation, especially with respect to space surveillance and tracking. the United States government has been tracking space objects since the late 1950s.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:07: In the aftermath of one donation's decision to conduct a destructive direct descent anti satellite missile test in 2007 and the subsequent Iridium cosmos collision in 2009, the United States expanded beyond the provision of a public satellite catalog. Subsequently, the United States began signing Space situational awareness agreements with both governmental and non governmental entities worldwide to provide additional space situational awareness information.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:38: To include screening for collisions and providing that information to the affected space operators.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:18:45: Many of the states participating in this OEWG or your commercial companies have been issued collision warnings. Work with the US Space Forces 18th and 19th Space Defense Squadrons to analyze the need for maneuvers or use the US Operator phone book to find contact information.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:04: The United States government has provided SSA information globally since 2010.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:11: The political commitment to make available basic space situational awareness data and provide for basic space traffic coordination, including conjunction and re-entry notification free of direct user fees, is formalized in the US National Space Policy of December 2020. We look forward to continue working with countries to share such data to ensure space sustainability.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:19:39: With regard to international cooperation, the United States takes into account the UN General Assembly Resolution 51122, the Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the interest of all States, taking into particular account the needs of developing countries.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:20:02: While the inherent dual use nature of many space capabilities is a potential concern when cooperating with others on space technologies, taking into account technology safeguards and non proliferation commitments, the United States has a long history of cooperation with others on space exploration and scientific research in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:20:25: Even those states unable to undertake their own missions are able to derive benefits from outer space, such as GPS, which the US freely provides to all, as well as through contracted communication services.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:20:39: Global Open Access Data Access policies provide access to geospatial data either free of charge or at a nominal cost. Just like our SSA information sharing and GPS provision. NASA, USGS and NOAA information products are available to all, either free or charge or at nominal cost.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:02: The United States recognizes the Outer Space Treaty already stipulates legal obligations related to international cooperation. For example, the Osts Article 9 Treaty obligation requires states to be, quote, guided by the principles of cooperation and mutual assistance. End Quote. And there are other OSD articles regarding the promotion of international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:30: Noting these, the United States offers some additional thoughts on concepts and voluntary proposals.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:37: Which could build upon these obligations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:21:40: 1st As we stated yesterday, we recognize that there may be an overlap of OEWG proposed norms or guidelines with the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. This is not a new concept. The 2013 GGE on TCP Miss recognizes that the draft LTS guidelines quote will have characteristics similar to those of transparency and confidence building measures. Some of them could be considered as potential transparency and confidence building measures.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:22:10: While others could provide the technical basis for the implementation of certain transparency and confidence building measures proposed by this group of governmental experts. End Quote.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:22:23: Therefore, these proposals do not need to be mutually exclusive between peaceful uses and security. However, this group should determine the security related aspect of each OEWG proposal.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:22:37: Specifically, we must determine how each proposal could reduce or eliminate the causes of mistrust, misunderstanding and miscalculation with regard to the activities and intentions of states.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:22:51: While international cooperation and SSA sharing related behaviors may initially look like pure safety concerns, they can also be risk reduction measures.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:01: For example, in the US proposal labeled G, which is quote, states should communicate and make notifications to enhance the safety and stability of outer space activities and to resolve concerns about international peace and security that arise from the conduct of outer space activities and quote specifically contemplated international cooperation and sharing. The LTS guidelines provide a number of similar supporting examples from the safety.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:33: And safety and civil perspective.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:36: One such guideline is LTS Guideline B1, which calls for States and intergovernmental organizations to exchange regularly updated contact information. Our Vienna counterparts are exchanging their civil points of contact for Space Flight safety.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:23:53: In order to communicate and make notifications, as in proposal G, the security sector would need contact information. We ask, would having a security related point of contact increase trust between military space operators?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:24:07: Would agreeing to exchange national security contact information be a good first step towards establishing appropriate means to enable notifications and timely coordination if a threat were perceived?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:24:22: Another example, LTS guideline B2, calls for improving the accuracy of orbital data for Space Flight safety and the use of common internationally recognized standards to enable collaboration and information exchange. If the United States is using different standards to determine our flight plans than another country, then who is correct when 1 country accuses the other of flying too close or without safe separation?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:24:51: What if that close approach is inadvertent because both parties have large margins of errors? What if it is a dual use satellite? Its operations could be perceived as threatening because both sides have different information about the same object. So part of our proposal G making notification resolving concerns would have to be underpinned by more accurate information and a shared understanding of that information, similar to our colleagues from India.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:21: Who just noted this? Thus, we can see that international cooperation to communicate and create shared understandings is so important and that safety and civil guidelines may be closely intertwined with security related responsible behaviors.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:38: The same LTS guideline B2 about SSA underpins the United States Behavioral proposal C Proposal C recommends that state should operate in FROM.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:25:52: To and through space in a professional manner. Without a shared understanding of where states are operating in space relative to other operator satellites, we will not be able to determine what is professional or safe. Improving and sharing SSA could increase predictability and assist states to avoid confusion about another's plans or intentions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:15: Therefore, the United States will continue to share SSA globally and encourage others to share their information as well.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:23: Finally, the United States reiterates that while some proposals for norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior may initially appear to be safety oriented.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:35: They may also underpin important security related behaviors because of their ability to reduce risks of misperception and build trust.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:44: Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:26:46: I thank the distinguished representative of the United States for her statement and would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of Thailand, the floor Madam.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:27:01: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thailand align itself with the US instead when delivered by Indonesia and which to add the following elements in its national capacity. Thailand attach great importance to international cooperation between or among states, international organizations, academia, commercial actors and other members of International Space community to make space safe and secure. We see the value in giving priority to information exchange, especially on situational awareness and space traffic management.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:27:34: Besides multilateral forums, we see MALLET incorporating a regional level in essence Subcommittee on Space Technology and at international level in APPSCO. For US, cooperation leads to better understanding, mutual benefit and interests of all bodies involved. Tell them you play its parts to ensure in that cooperation will be in accordance to related international laws. At the same time, such cooperation shall not be limited.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:05: Only by existing legal obligation of states, states, especially those with more advanced technology, should step forward to support those in need of technical assistance to ensure that space and space technology benefit all of mankind as set out in the Outer Space Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:24: Mr. Share differencing point of view and levels of capabilities reflected in our discussion. They affirms that we need to further strengthen our dialogue and relevant international cooperation to fight convergence and set out a course of actions to guarantee a space safety and security on the basis of equality, responsibility and in accordance with related international laws. I thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:28:55: I thank the distinguished representative of Thailand for her statement.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:01: Are there any other speakers? Yes, I already see the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:12: Possible. Thank you, distinguished Mr. Chairman. I'll try to be brief on this item on this topic.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:23: Since this topic it is in many ways duplicates by its very nature the previous two topics.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:35: Overall that they pretty much get down to the same thing.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:40: In this regard, the arguments of our delegation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:45: Who will overlap with the arguments that we laid out in the previous two topics?\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:29:51: Since here two, we're talking about.\n",

      "Transcribed: 01:44:24: Countries are different in terms of technical capacity.\n",

      "Transcribed: 01:48:24: The issue of international cooperation is addressed at length in the Outer Space Treaty and associated instruments. Article 9 of the OST in particular establishes that the exploration of outer space must be guided by the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:48:40: The GG on TCBM goes further by recognizing that international cooperation is a fundamental way for all states to have the possibility of enjoying the benefits of the peaceful exploration of outer space.\n",

      "Transcribed: 01:49:32: A Promoting the development of space science and technology and of its applications, B Fostering the development of relevant and appropriate space capabilities in interested states in interested states, and C facilitating the exchange of expertise and technology among states on a mutually acceptable basis.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:49:54: In the era of space security, there is a need for further multilateral cooperation regarding the sharing of information on monitoring of space objects in particular.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:50:03: To in order to enable broad, credible and accessible situation, space situation or awareness SSA for Brazil, the strengthening of SSA capabilities is essential to counter the perception that outer space is congested. We recall that the main limitation to the use of Earth orbits is not necessarily the dimension of the space domain, but the ability to ensure the safety, reliability and long term sustainability of space traffic management.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:50:34: In addition to providing a clear picture of the use of orbits and furthering the safety of space operations, increased SSA would serve the purpose of detecting abnormal and malicious behavior, identifying compromised satellites, issuing warnings about vulnerabilities, minimizing threats to critical services, and other security related purposes. Furthermore, strengthening SSA can also serve as a basis for attribution and verification.\n",

In the context of discussions under this topic and the statement made by the distinguished delegation of the US regarding space situational awareness, my delegation would like to register our appreciation for the SSA data shared by the US, which we feel is of high utility in the overall context of promoting outer space safety, sustainability as well as security.

      "Transcribed: 01:52:21: I see the distinguished representative of the Holy See, you have the floor.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:52:27: Thank you, Mr. Chair. The delegation of the Holy See wishes to thank you for your leadership and the preparatory work that went into this meeting. We found this approach useful in addressing existing international legal and normative frameworks, as well as in fostering common understandings. We are also grateful to other delegations for sharing recommendations, both in their statements and in the several working papers submitted during and in advance of this meeting. Mr. Chair, as one human family, we share our planet and its surroundings, including its many wonders and vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:52:58: Given the increased reliance on outer space for civilian activities, and considering the consequences triggered by fierce competition among states for dominance in that arena, it is of paramount importance to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes as a global Commons. In this regard, it is also important to recall that information collected from space contributes to international peace and security, including by providing data critical for verifying compliance with the disarmament and arms control treaties, as well as to facilitate humanitarian assistance.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:53:29: Mr. Chair, it is not by chance that Article One of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty affirms that quote the exploration and use of outer space shall be the province of all mankind. End Quote. Such an approach appears self-evident and is essential to preventing lawlessness and promoting the common good. At the same time, leveraging outer space for nefarious activities to the detriment of others would be contrary to this spirit. Given our discussions during the past few days, it is clear that technological advancement and developments in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:54:00: Have been outpacing international governance and regulatory frameworks. Space activities are constantly evolving and instruments to address space security concerns should at a minimum, progress in parallel, ideally anticipating future scenarios. At the same time, there is also the emerging growing concern that as outer space becomes more economically viable and strategically important, it could become both a theater and means to wage conflict. Therefore, we must respond by urgently adapting and building upon existing legal instruments, taking as a starting point the UN Charter and the Outer Space Treaty.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:54:36: In this regard, worrying trends such as increased research and investments in anti satellite and other counter space capabilities, as well as increasing orbit congestions, space debris and cyber warfare all contribute to rising threats. It is therefore the view of this delegation that a verifiable comprehensive commitment banning first placement of all categories of weapons is fundamental. In addition, a multilateral commitment to prohibiting the development and testing of anti satellite weapons.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:55:05: Would contribute to enhancing collective security and responsibility.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:55:09: Mr. Chair, our interactions will prove beneficial to the degree that we can agree on collectively shared norms and rules of space traffic. To help ensure respect for such rules, one possibility is to envisage a multilateral body to monitor the use of outer space and norms that regulate this use.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:55:29: One only need to consider the chaos that would ensue if regulations and customary practices did not exist for air traffic navigation at sea or for road and rail transportation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:55:38: As more and more states, and also private actors establish their presence, presence in space activities, the need for clear norms and regulations will become increasingly urgent. Furthermore, the element of subjectivity in the perception of threats can only be mitigated by agreeing on specific norms, rules and principles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:55:58: While welcoming transparency and confidence building measures, the Holy See would also support the negotiation of a comprehensive, legally binding instrument in the pertinent fora.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:56:08: Such an instrument would help preserve and guarantee outer space as an exclusively peaceful and sustainable environment, helping to prevent any future arms race. Ultimately, ethical behaviour in outer space should be guided by a sense of shared responsibility and oriented towards the common good, including for future generations. Indeed, it is imperative not to repeat the same mistakes in outer space that we have committed on Earth, such as violent conflict, the contamination of weapons deterrence and the reckless exploitation of environmental resources.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:56:40: At the same time, norms, rules and principles for encouraging responsible behavior can be promoted through joint scientific projects. In this regard, joint scientific projects, such as a collective effort to clean space debris, would be a concrete step towards turning threats into opportunities guided by the principle of human fraternity. Mr. Chair. Since time immemorial, the starry skies above have been a source of profound fascination and inspiration to all peoples spread out across the earth.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:57:09: In a world regrettably rife with conflict and injustices, let us not increase the risks, but rather help create a culture of peace and fraternity for the future spacefaring generations to come. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:57:24: I thank the distinguished representative of the Holy See for his statement and I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Australia.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:57:39: Thank you, Chair. I'd like to make the following remarks under Topic 10 approaches for further developing norms, rules and principles, including in relation to how they contribute to the negotiation of illegally bonding instrument, including on the prevention of alarms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:57:54: Chair From the outset, Australia's ambition for the open-ended working group has been for it to produce outcomes and recommendations that will bolster security, transparency, stability, predictability and trust.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:58:08: We want the group to identify responsible behaviours and assist improving communications and consultations between states.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:58:16: We've argued that much of this can be achieved through non body norms, rules and principles such as the implementation of transparency and confidence building measures.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:58:26: Australia has argued that our focus needs to be on the effects of behaviours. This approach ensures, against definitional parameters we apply being outpaced by rapidly developing technologies.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:58:38: It also preserves access to possible dual use capabilities for the positive purposes that they have been developed for, such as space domains sustainability.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:58:50: In terms of further developing non binding norms, rules and principles, we suggest further work could be achieved by reconstituting this open-ended working group following the 4th session in August and September 2023.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:59:05: There is also opportunity to discuss these issues in other forum. In April, the United Nations Disarmament Commission will conclude its work on TCBMS, A vital element of the responsible behaviors approach.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:59:20: Responsible behaviour should also be a key topic for discussion at the Conference on Disarmament under the Paris Agenda.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:59:28: And next year, the Secretary General plans to host a high level space summit as part of the summit of the future. This will be a further opportunity to explore responsible behaviors in that context.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:59:40: Chair Australia applauds those States and organizations that have arranged regional meetings to discuss the issues of this working group. These observe to promote and increase understanding of responsible behaviors approach.\n",
      "Transcribed: 01:59:53: We continue to encourage commercial initiatives that might develop codes of conduct or other guidelines.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:00:00: And we encourage all states to engage in processes that are seeking to further define existing bodies of international law that are applicable in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:00:11: Chair. Last year, the UN General Assembly voted to establish a United Nations group of governmental experts, the G.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:00:19: To consider and make recommendations on substantial elements of an international legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, including interalia or the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:00:32: Although the membership of the JA is still to be determined, Australia calls on the experts selected to consider how responsible behaviors can assist to meet its objectives.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:00:42: Australia also considers that the following criteria must be met.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:00:48: The recommendations must be clear on the scope and ambition of the agreement. The recommendation should provide clear and consistent definitions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:00:58: The recommended agreement should be equitable, verifiable and make a tangible contribution to space security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:01:06: There is little point in developing A treaty that no state is willing to ratify.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:01:12: Any agreement should be based on a common understanding of the threats and irresponsible behaviours of concern. History has demonstrated that the most supported space instruments have been built through the iterative development of principles and norms. It's important to ensure that we have a solid foundation of TCBMS and non binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour before we look to what may come next. Thank you Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:01:40: May I thank the distinguished representative of Australia for this statement, and now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:01:55: Thank you very much, distinguished Chair.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:05: Before I turn to the presentation of our approaches to this topic.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:12: We believe that it will be crucially important to introduce clarity.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:19: Into the very notion of norms, rules, and principles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:27: Because.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:30: As we understood from the statements made by several delegations and also from the working documents that were submitted.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:40: We have differing views on what the terms, norms, rules and principles actually mean.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:52: We share the position expressed by some countries.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:02:59: That were in favor of.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:03:29: Nevertheless, we believe that the lack of a common understanding of these notions.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:03:38: First of all, what refers to norms and rules?\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:03:44: All of this relates to the different legal doctrines that states have.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:03:50: For example, in a Russian legal doctrine.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:03:56: The notion norm.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:03:59: Is considered as a rule of behavior.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:04: It can be something that permits certain acts. It could be prohibiting or prescribing certain forms of behavior.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:16: In all of this, under the notion norm, what is understood is a legal norm that is mandatory.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:28: A rule On the contrary.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:32: Does not have any mandatory nature.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:40: Therefore, as we continue our work in this group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:45: We.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:47: Base ourselves.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:49: Solely.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:04:53: The requirements that are prescribed by Russian legal school and Russian legal doctrine.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:05:05: Now these basic theoretical questions are, we believe, of crucial importance from the point of view of, above all, the practical aspects of the work of this group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:05:19: Especially in the context of preparation of recommendations and the final document of this group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:05:32: Would like to once again stress.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:05:36: The fact that as we prepare that document, we will be using the legal understandings that we have in terms of what rules and norms are.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:05:49: So This is why we do not share the views expressed by several delegations that understand the notion of a norm as something that is not legally binding.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:03: For us, I'll repeat once again.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:07: A norm is something that is legally binding. It's a legal norm of a mandatory nature.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:19: And This is why.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:22: We believe that the preparation by this group of any recommendations and as we do that work.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:32: We can easily talk about not simply politically binding norms or rules.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:40: Has many delegations attempted to present it, but also this group can.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:48: Work on.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:50: Norms that will be also legally binding.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:06:58: But even if we talk about purely politically binding.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:04: Principles and commitments related to ensuring the safety of space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:10: We and all of this stress that the elaboration of such principles and recommendations.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:17: Is not a goal in itself.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:21: For UN states.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:24: But it is an interim step as we move towards.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:07:34: In all of this we.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:37: Focus on the fact that such norms, rules and principles.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:43: That will be part of the recommendations to be made by this group. All of this should not in any way replace the process of preparing a legally binding instrument on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:07:59: Something that would include prohibitions on the placement of weapons in outer space, the use of threat or threat of use of force against space objects, or using space objects.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:08:12: We also would like to once again point out that without.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:08:19: Robust guarantees and safeguards that will keep outer space free of weapons, something that will be enshrined and international legally binding.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:08:32: Instruments and agreements on Paris.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:08:36: Without that, the resolution of questions related to peaceful use of outer space and the safety and security of space activity has no future. We will not be able to resolve all of those issues without any robust, legally binding norms.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:08:54: Such understandings that are supported by a majority of UN member states.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:09:01: Have to be taken into consideration as we continue our discussions of the problem of space activities.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:09:09: This is what we use as a guide when in further developing the resolution of the UN General Assembly 76230.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:09:22: The further practical steps to prevent an arms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:09:27: And in light of the recommendations contained in the report of UN Secretary General 7780.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:09:36: We provided for in a modified resolution of the General Assembly 77250 related on further measures in the area of Paris. We included provisions on launching the work of a group of governmental experts for the study and presentation of recommendations on.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:10:08: Including, in particular, the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:10:14: What is planned is that this GG will include 25 experts representing UN member states that will be elected on the basis of the principal equitable geographical representation, and we do hope that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:10:31: These experts will be engaged in constructive work in that GGE in order to prepare recommendations on elements of a legally binding instrument on Paris.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:10:49: We do hope that the experience of the work of the previous GGE.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:10:56: When, when one expert at the very last stage of the work of the group, in fact the final report was blocked, we hope that experience will not repeat itself.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:11:09: It is also provided for that the new group will work on the basis of consensus and will hold two sessions in Geneva, one session in 2023 and the second session in 2024.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:11:23: And each session will last for two weeks moreover.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:11:29: We expect the chairman of that group to organize in New York in 2024.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:11:37: In 2024 unofficial open-ended intersectional group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:11:43: And consultative meeting in order to ensure that all Member States can have an exchange of views on the basis of the interim report of the group.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:11:52: That will be prepared by the chairman in his personal capacity.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:11:57: And also to ensure that all another governmental entities have the opportunity to make their own contributions in the form of presenting their ideas and views.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:12:12: On the issue or topic that will be submitted for the consideration of that GG.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:12:19: The final report of the GGE will be submitted to the UN General Assembly during its 79th session, and on all of that would like to stress that, and I would like to refer to the relevant prison relevant provisions of Resolution 77250.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:12:39: That if the Conference on Disarmament agrees and will start implementing A comprehensive and balanced program of work that would include.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:12:54: On a document that is legally binding on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:13:00: Then the new group of Government group of expert would wrap up its work, and it would present all of the information on interim results of that work to the UN Secretary General.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:13:14: For the submission of that information at a later stage, this Conference on Disarmament.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:13:21: And here I would like to immediately.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:13:26: Refer to any potential attempts to say that in light of the stalemate or crisis that we see in the CD.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:13:35: It will be impossible to discuss any legally binding instrument in that form.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:13:43: We would like to say that the GE that will be created has as its gold.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:14:34: And all of this would like to specify right away that we are not considering this Gigi in as a an initiative that competes with the work of the open-ended working group on so-called responsible behavior in outer space. On the contrary, we do hope to use the achievements of this open-ended.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:15:01: Working group.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:15:39: This is why we're looking forward to having.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:15:44: The G start its work after the last meeting of this open-ended working group, preferably in November of this year.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:15:56: We are convinced that the appeal of the young General Assembly to all countries.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:16:04: Especially to countries that have large space potentials as extremely timely, the appeal to take urgent measures to ensure that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:16:16: Weapons will never be placed in outer space to prevent the use of force or the threat of use of force in outer space or from space against Earth.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:16:26: And also from the Earth against any space object.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:16:32: Now more than ever, it is important to ensure that space is not an arena for an arms race and to preserve space as a peaceful area of activities, and all of this should become a norm in the activities and policies of young Member States, in line with international commitment.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:16:52: That have been generally recognized and all of that we should prevent any attempts to review the decisions of the first SSOD of the United Nations from 1978 aimed at carrying out research and use of outer space for purely peaceful purposes and preventing an arms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:17:16: And launching relevant negotiations in line with what is provided by the Outer Space Treaty.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:17:59: Some of these statements.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:18:03: Point to a certain contradiction.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:18:07: Related to the notion of responsible behavior in outer space with the activities of the future DG, we do not share this point of view. I would like to say once again, there's no contradiction in this.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:18:39: All over this provides for comprehensive discussions of certain aspects of behavior in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:18:48: This is something that is reflected in some way in the mandate of this GE.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:18:58: Mandate refers to discussions by the future group as one of the topics.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:19:06: Such types of behavior like any potential placement of weapons in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:19:16: And here we're talking about preventing such type of behavior.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:19:53: And that.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:19:55: One of the elements of such a discussion is something that this open-ended working group should be involved.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:20:03: In as well. This is the element that we're discussing right now. It is part of topic 10 that was proposed to us by our distinguished chairperson to be discussed during the session of this group and one of the topics is indeed the discussion of.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:20:21: How the recommendations of this open-ended working group could make a contribution to the negotiations of legally binding instruments, including legally binding instruments on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:20:48: Resolution of the UN General Assembly 77250.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:20:54: That group must take into account.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:20:58: These principles, and this simply means that this open-ended working group will make a contribution to the work of the future GE and through that GE it will lead to the elaboration of a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Thank you.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:21:18: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement, and now I would like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of South Africa.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:21:32: Thank you for giving me the floor, Chairperson. My delegation wishes to thank you for the manner in which you are guiding our work thus far and we assure you of South Africa's full support.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:21:44: South Africa welcomed General Assembly Resolution 7330 on Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space and 7331 on No First Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, both of which reaffirm the importance and urgency of the objective of preventing an arms race in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:22:04: And the willingness of all states to contribute to reaching this common goal, as well as Resolution 73 slash 72 on transparency and confidence building measures in outer space activities, which reaffirms that preventing an arms race in outer space is in the interest of maintaining international peace and security.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:22:25: To this end, my delegation has taken note of all the working papers that have been submitted thus far and we acknowledge the work that has been carried out during the course of this week to advance the work of the OEWG.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:22:40: The increase of space debris, and specifically the issue of intentional creation of space debris, is also a matter of concern for South Africa due to the indiscriminate risk that it poses to space systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:22:54: And a consequent risk of disruption of many space based activities on which we all rely. Therefore, South Africa RE emphasizes the urgent need for the commencement of substantive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a legally binding instrument in the fulfilment of the Paris agenda. A treaty based approach would bring legal clarity and predictability on the security related rights and responsibilities of states in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:23:26: However, pending the finalization of such a legal instrument, we also supported the establishment of this open-ended working group on reducing space threats through norms, rules and responsible behaviors. Achieving common understandings and agreement on norms, rules and principles would be complementary to an eventual Paris Treaty, but until such a treaty is concluded, these norms, rules and principles for responsible behaviours could contribute.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:23:57: To addressing current concerns and issues.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:24:00: South Africa notes that the existing space legal regime already constrains the weaponization of outer space to some extent, and we therefore share the names position.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:24:12: Calling for strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements, and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space, the OEWG may wish to explicitly reaffirm the applicability of international law to outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:24:29: Even as the Paris aspects of this legal regime may benefit from further development, it is with widely expected. It is also widely accepted that outer space is already militarized in the sense that modern militaries rely on space based systems, and is also true that critical civilian infrastructure is increasingly reliant on such systems.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:24:57: Mr. Chairperson The African Union adopted its space policy and strategy.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:25:03: To ensuring space science and technology that they serve as a key driver for inclusive and sustainable development in Africa.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:25:13: Part of the strategy is the recognition that critical information derived from the use of space based products and services can contribute to the continent's efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. My delegation therefore reiterates Africa's position, as reflected in the 2019 working paper.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:25:33: On recommendations to promote the practical implementation of transparency and confidence building measures in outer space activities that while voluntary transparency and confidence building measures may partially contribute.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:25:47: To reducing mistrust and enhancing the safety of outer space operations in the short term by avoiding accidents resulting from mistakes or miscalculations. They cannot represent and substitute for a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, including the prohibition of the placement of any weapons in outer space as well as the treat or use of force against objects in outer space.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:26:19: Some transparency and confidence building measures could also be integrated into a future legally binding instrument On preventing an arms race in outer space. We believe that there is fundamental agreement on a significant peaceful benefits of outer space, on the importance of ensuring that space does not become an arena of weaponization or military contestation. South Africa hopes that member states will be able to put aside their differences.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:26:50: And work towards a more productive discussion during the next session of this OEWG. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n",

      "Transcribed: 02:27:38: As for particular terms from the Outer Space Treaty, such as Durigert and harmful interference, the International Committee has not yet reached consensus on this, and thus more discussion is needed.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:27:52: With this in mind, Japan directly proposed the following two direct recommendations. States should continue to discuss ways to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation in outer space, including in relation to our peers.\n",
      "Transcribed: 02:28:08: States should continue to discuss matters relating to due regard and harmful interference stipulated in their Outer Space Treaty with a beauty art correcting the interpretation of these words from a practical point of view. In particular, states should implement, share and accumulate best practices regarding actions.\n",
